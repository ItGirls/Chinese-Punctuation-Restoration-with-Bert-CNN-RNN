But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have And yet repeatedly you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision But that's not the only way you can rig your data You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish You can give the competing drug in too low a dose so that people aren't properly treated You can give the competing drug in too high a dose so that people get side effects And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia 20 years ago a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol And it's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better 10 years ago history repeated itself interestingly when risperidone which was the first of the new-generation antipscyhotic drugs came off copyright so anybody could make copies Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day Again not an insane dose not an illegal dose but very much at the high end of normal And so you're bound to make your new drug look better And so it's no surprise that overall industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials But -- and it's a big but -- it turns out when you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials that they're actually better than independently sponsored trials And yet they always manage to to get the result that they want So how does this work How can we explain this strange phenomenon Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients And this is the most important aspect of the whole story It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action You can use statistics or you can use stories I personally prefer statistics so that's what I'm going to do first This is something called funnel plot And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared have gone missing in action So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment And as you go up towards the top of the graph what you see is each dot is a trial And as you go up those are the bigger trials so they've got less error in them So they're less likely to be randomly false positives randomly false negatives So they all cluster together The big trials are closer to the true answer Then as you go further down at the bottom what you can see is over on this side the spurious false negatives and over on this side the spurious false positives If there is publication bias if small negative trials have gone missing in action you can see it on one of these graphs So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias And I think that's the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear That's how you can prove it statistically but what about stories Well they're heinous they really are This is a drug called reboxetine This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients And I'm a very nerdy doctor I hope I try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature I read the trials on this They were all positive They were all well-conducted I found no flaw Unfortunately it turned out that many of these trials were withheld In fact 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients Now if you think about it if I tossed a coin a hundred times and I'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads If we remove half of the data we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is And this is not an isolated story Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld but it goes way beyond that The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown And they need to have access to all of the trial data But the companies withheld that data from them and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution And to show how big it goes this is a drug called Tamiflu which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu We already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours But I don't really care about that Governments don't care about that I'm very sorry if you have the flu I know it's horrible but we're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day We prescribe these drugs we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications which means pneumonia and which means death The infectious diseases Cochrane Group which are based in Italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not and they've not been able to get that information This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information So it's a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion But I would say this: I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant All of these things are happening in plain sight and they're all protected by a force field of tediousness And I think with all of the problems in science one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid finger around in the mechanics and peer in Thank you very much In the past several days I heard people talking about China And also I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet Something is very challenging to me I want to make my friends understand: China is complicated So I always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that You can't just tell a one sided story I'll give an example China is a BRIC country BRIC country means Brazil Russia India and China This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy But at the same time on the other hand China is a SICK country the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file He said the SICK country means Syria Iran China and North Korea The four countries have no access to Facebook So basically China is a SICK BRIC country Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet And now today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years from that wall So if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom It prevents weird things from the north Same was true for China In the north there was a great wall Chang Cheng It protected China from invaders for 2，000 years But China also has a great firewall That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas from the universal values but also to prevent China's own citizens to access the global free Internet and even separate themselves into blocks not united So basically the Internet has two Internets One is the Internet the other is the Chinanet But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland wasteland I think it's wrong But we also use a very simple metaphor the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship government censorship the cat and the Chinese Internet users That means us the mouse But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple So today I want to upgrade it to 2。0 version In China we have 500 million Internet users That's the biggest population of Netizens Internet users in the whole world So even though China's is a totally censored Internet but still Chinese Internet society is really booming How to make it It's simple You have Google we have Baidu You have Twitter we have Weibo You have Facebook we have Renren You have YouTube we have Youku and Tudou The Chinese government blocked every single international Web 2。0 service and we Chinese copycat every one So that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship That's not only to censor you Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple: Block and clone On the one hand he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network which is very important; people really love social networking But on the other hand they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China because they can't accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands For example Mubarak he shut down the Internet He wanted to prevent the Netizens from criticizing him But once Netizens can't go online they go in the street And now the result is very simple We all know Mubarak is technically dead But also Ben Ali Tunisian president didn't follow the second rule That means keep the server in your hands He allowed Facebook a U。S。-based service to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia So he can't prevent it his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption The same thing happend He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring But those two very smart international censorship policies didn't prevent Chinese social media from becoming a really public sphere a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China It's the entire population of the United States So when these 300 million people microbloggers even they block the tweet in our censored platform But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create very powerful energy which has never happened in the Chinese history 2011 in July two unclear trains crashed in Wenzhou a southern city Right after the train crash authorities literally wanted to cover up the train bury the train So it angered the Chinese Netizens The first five days after the train crash there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media which never happened in Chinese history And later this year the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years And also recently very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing So the up is the Embassy data the PM 2。5 He showed 148 they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group So a suggestion it's not good to go outside But that is the Ministry's data He shows 50 He says it's good It's good to go outside But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy's side I live in Beijing Every day I just watch the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window Why is Chinese social networking even within the censorship so booming Part of the reason is Chinese languages You know Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of 140 characters But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link Maybe in Germany in German language it may be just Aha But in Chinese language it's really about 140 characters means a paragraph a story You can almost have all the journalistic elements there For example this is Hamlet of Shakespeare It's the same content One you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3。5 English tweets Chinese is always cheating right So because of this the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to media And also the clone Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter It even has its own name with Weibo Weibo is the Chinese translation for microblog It has its own innovation At the commenting area it makes the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook rather than the original Twitter So these innovations and clones as the Weibo and microblogging when it came to China in 2009 it immediately became a media platform itself It became the media platform of 300 million readers It became the media Anything not mentioned in Weibo it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public But also Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life For example they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard We had a petition system It's a remedy outside the judicial system because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth: The emperor is good The old local officials are thugs So that's why the petitioner the victims the peasants want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem But when more and more people go to Beijing they also cause the risk of a revolution So they send them back in recent years And even some of them were put into black jails But now we have Weibo so I call it the Weibo petition People just use their cell phones to tweet So your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities One of them is Yao Chen she is the most popular microblogger in China who has about 21 million followers They're almost like a national TV station If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her So this Weibo social media even in the censorship still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together talking together It's like a big TED right But also it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people But also the cat the censorship is not sleeping It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo For example you can't post the name of the president Hu Jintao and also you can't post the city of Chongqing the name and until recently you can't search the surname of top leaders So the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes They even name themselves -- you know use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab The grass-mud horse is caoníma is the phonogram for motherfucker the Netizens call themselves River crab is héxiè is the phonogram for harmonization for censorship So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè that's very good So when some very political exciting moments happened you can see on Weibo you see a lot of very weird stories happened Weird phrases and words even if you have a PhD of Chinese language you can't understand them But you can't even expand more no because Chinese Sina Weibo when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter。com That means from the very beginning Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime For example anything you want to post like get together or meet up or walk it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing Even if you want to have some gathering before you go there the police are already waiting for you Why Because they have the data They have everything in their hands So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident So the crackdown is very serious But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat-and-mouse The cat is the censorship but Chinese is not only one cat but also has local cats Central cat and local cats You know the server is in the central cats' hands so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing Without bribing the central cats he can do nothing only apologize So these three years in the past three years social movements about microblogging really changed local government became more and more transparent because they can't access the data The server is in Beijing The story about the train crash maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticisms in five days but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online It's never happened before And so it's very simple because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy this independent kingdom So they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him But also the Bo Xilai case recently very big news he's a princeling But from February to April this year Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors You can almost joke everything about these princelings everything It's almost like you're living in the United States But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing you definitely will be arrested So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window So Chinese in China censorship is normal Something you find is freedom is weird Something will happen behind it Because he was a very popular Leftist leader so the central government wanted to purge him and he was very cute he convinced all the Chinese people why he is so bad So Weibo the 300 million public sphere became a very good convenient tool for a political fight But this technology is very new but technically is very old It was made famous by Chairman Mao Mao Zedong because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government It's very simple because Chinese central government doesn't need to even lead the public opinion They just give them a target window to not censor people Not censoring in China has become a political tool So that's the update about this game cat-and-mouse Social media changed Chinese mindset More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright not some imported American privilege But also it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to it's like a training of their citizenship preparing for future democracy But it didn't change the Chinese political system and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions So what's the future After all we are the mouse Whatever the future is we should fight against the cat There is not only in China but also in the United States there are some very small cute but bad cats SOPA PIPA ACTA TPP and ITU And also like Facebook and Google they claim they are friends of the mouse but sometimes we see them dating the cats So my conclusion is very simple We Chinese fight for our freedom you just watch your bad cats Don't let them hook up with the Chinese cats Only in this way in the future we will achieve the dreams of the mouse: that we can tweet anytime anywhere without fear Thank you I love a challenge and saving the Earth is probably a good one We all know the Earth is in trouble We have now entered in the 6X the sixth major extinction on this planet I often wondered if there was a United Organization of Organisms -- otherwise known as Uh-Oh -- -- and every organism had a right to vote would we be voted on the planet or off the planet I think that vote is occurring right now I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based on mycelium The mycelium infuses all landscapes it holds soils together it's extremely tenacious This holds up to 30，000 times its mass They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks cedars and Douglas firs Dusty and I we like to say on Sunday this is where we go to church I'm in love with the old-growth forest and I'm a patriotic American because we have those Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms And frankly I face a big obstacle When I mention mushrooms to somebody they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms their eyes glaze over and they think I'm a little crazy So I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group We call it mycophobia the irrational fear of the unknown when it comes to fungi Mushrooms are very fast in their growth Day 21 day 23 day 25 Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics In fact we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta -- a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together We share in common the same pathogens Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria and so our best antibiotics come from fungi But here is a mushroom that's past its prime After they sporulate they do rot But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest They give rise to the trees they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium And so we see a mushroom here sporulating And the spores are germinating and the mycelium forms and goes underground In a single cubic inch of soil there can be more than eight miles of these cells My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey And notice that as the mycelium grows it conquers territory and then it begins the net I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years I have thousands of electron micrographs and when I'm staring at the mycelium I realize that they are microfiltration membranes We exhale carbon dioxide so does mycelium It inhales oxygen just like we do But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes And in these cavities these micro-cavities form and as they fuse soils they absorb water These are little wells And inside these wells then microbial communities begin to form And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms I first proposed in the early 1990s that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet When you look at the mycelium they're highly branched And if there's one branch that is broken then very quickly because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information The mycelium is sentient It knows that you are there When you walk across landscapes it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris So I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven biologically successful model The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit and we now being the top organism on this planet are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere Going way out dark matter conforms to the same mycelial archetype I believe matter begets life; life becomes single cells; single cells become strings; strings become chains; chains network And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe Most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land They came to land 1。3 billion years ago and plants followed several hundred million years later How is that possible It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids and many other acids and enzymes pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals and forming calcium oxalates Makes the rocks crumble and the first step in the generation of soil Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together So fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates And all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix This was first discovered in 1859 This is a photograph by Franz Hueber This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia 420 million years ago this organism existed It was called Prototaxites Prototaxites laying down was about three feet tall The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet Dr Boyce at the University of Chicago published an article in the Journal of Geology this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus a giant mushroom Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms All across most land masses And these existed for tens of millions of years Now we've had several extinction events and as we march forward -- 65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact The Earth was struck by an asteroid a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere Sunlight was cut off and fungi inherited the Earth Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded because fungi do not need light More recently at Einstein University they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy much like plants use light So the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere I think is a forgone conclusion at least in my own mind The largest organism in the world is in Eastern Oregon I couldn't miss it It was 2，200 acres in size: 2，200 acres in size 2，000 years old The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat one cell wall thick How is it that this organism can be so large and yet be one cell wall thick whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us The mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom -- it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt We were involved with several experiments I'm going to show you six if I can solutions for helping to save the world Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham Washington There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste: one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes; one pile was treated with bacteria; and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium The mycelium absorbs the oil The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together So the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil and then when we returned six weeks later all the tarps were removed all the other piles were dead dark and stinky We came back to our pile it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms and the color changed to a light form The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms They're very large They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained But something else happened which was an epiphany in my life They sporulated the spores attract insects the insects laid eggs eggs became larvae Birds then came bringing in seeds and our pile became an oasis of life Whereas the other three piles were dead dark and stinky and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons -- went from 10，000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks The last image we don't have The entire pile was a green berm of life These are gateway species vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities So I invented burlap sacks bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing E coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration So we set up a site in Mason County Washington and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms And I'll show you a graph here This is a logarithmic scale 10 to the eighth power There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram and 10 to the third power is around 1，000 In 48 hours to 72 hours these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10，000 times Think of the implications This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year So this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time This is my wife Dusty with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest that Dioscorides first described in 65 A。D as a treatment against consumption This mushroom grows in Washington State Oregon northern California British Columbia now thought to be extinct in Europe May not seem that large -- let's get closer This is extremely rare fungus Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out -- we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year We found one sample to be able to get into culture Preserving the genome of these fungi in the old-growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health I've been involved with the U。S Defense Department BioShield program We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites And a few years ago we received these results We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses Dr Earl Kern who's a smallpox expert of the U。S Defense Department states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active 10 or greater are considered to be very active Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range There's a vetted press release that you can read -- it's vetted by DOD -- if you Google Stamets and smallpox Or you can go to NPR。org and listen to a live interview So encouraged by this naturally we went to flu viruses And so for the first time I am showing this We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses Here's the selectivity index numbers -- against pox you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses compared to the ribavirin controls we have an extraordinarily high activity And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1 H3N2 -- as well as flu B viruses So then we tried a blend and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1 and we got greater than 1，000 selectivity index I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old-growth forest as a matter of national defense I became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants So I went to the EPA homepage and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites I did something that nobody else had done I actually chased the mycelium when it stopped producing spores These are spores -- this is in their spores I was able to morph the culture into a non-sporulating form And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house But the insects aren't stupid and they would avoid the spores when they came close and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields every day in my house and the ants were attracted to the mycelium because there's no spores They gave it to the queen One week later I had no sawdust piles whatsoever And then -- a delicate dance between dinner and death -- the mycelium is consumed by the ants they become mummified and boing a mushroom pops out of their head Now after sporulation the spores repel So the house is no longer suitable for invasion So you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites And so my house came down I received my first patent against carpenter ants termites and fire ants Then we tried extracts and lo and behold we can steer insects to different directions This has huge implications I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent It covers over 200，000 species This is the most disruptive technology -- I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry -- that they have ever witnessed This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world You could fly 100 Ph。D students under the umbrella of this concept because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi prior to sporulation attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores And so I came up with a Life Box because I needed a delivery system The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil you add water you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the Agarikon mushroom The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium And then you put tree seeds in here and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box I want to reinvent the delivery system and the use of cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up you could make it interactive zip code specific -- where people could join together and through satellite imaging systems through Virtual Earth or Google Earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes You could take a cardboard box delivering shoes you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community -- corns beans and squash and onions I took several containers -- my wife said if I could do this anybody could -- and I ended up growing a seed garden Then you harvest the seeds -- and thank you Eric Rasmussen for your help on this -- and then you're harvesting the seed garden Then you can harvest the kernels and then you just need a few kernels I add mycelium to it and then I inoculate the corncobs Now three corncobs no other grain -- lots of mushrooms begin to form Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank and so this population will be shut down But watch what happens here The mushrooms then are harvested but very importantly the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars And so I thought how could we address the energy crisis in this country And we came up with Econol Generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary -- and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent about the generation of fuels So we build the carbon banks on the planet renew the soils These are a species that we need to join with I think engaging mycelium can help save the world Thank you very much So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa A year and a half ago four of the five people who are full time members at Ushahidi which means testimony in Swahili were TED Fellows A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence And in that time we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them We took what we knew about Africa the default device the mobile phone as our common denominator and went from there We got reports like this This is just a couple of them from January 17th last year And our system was rudimentary It was very basic It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people and we put it on our map But then we decided we needed to do something more We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world And so there is a team of developers from all over Africa who are part of this team now -- from Ghana from Malawi from Kenya There is even some from the U。S We're building for smartphones so that it can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world We are realizing that this is true If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere And so we build for it in Africa first and then we move to the edges It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa small NGOs doing their own little projects Just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about I'm here to talk about the next big thing because what we're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it There is so much information; what do you do This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai How do you decide what is important What is the veracity level of what you're looking at So what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours What we are looking at is the first three hours How do we deal with that information that is coming in You can't understand what is actually happening On the ground and around the world people are still curious and trying to figure out what is going on But they don't know So what we built of course Ushahidi is crowdsourcing this information You see this with Twitter too You get this information overload So you've got a lot of information That's great But now what So we think that there is something interesting we can do here And we have a small team who is working on this We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter Take the crowd and apply them to the information And by rating it and by rating the different people who submit information we can get refined results and weighted results So that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not This is the kind of innovation that is quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect From young smart developers And it's a community around it that has decided to build this So thank you very much And we are very happy to be part of the TED family Fifty years ago when I began exploring the ocean no one -- not Jacques Perrin not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it It seemed at that time to be a sea of Eden but now we know and now we are facing paradise lost I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in 50 years we've lost -- actually we've taken we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying but it really should concern you It does concern you as well I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls tomorrow's child asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time Well now is that time I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and in so doing secure hope for humankind Health to the ocean means health for us And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe And I hope Jill that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet Did I say that I guess I did For me as a scientist it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim It was six miles offshore and 1，250 feet down It's one of my favorite bathing suits Since then I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea I led a five-year National Geographic expedition the Sustainable Seas expeditions using these little subs They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it And I'm living proof Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air food water temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said Life support system We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it The poet Auden said Thousands have lived without love; none without water Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean No blue no green If you think the ocean isn't important imagine Earth without it Mars comes to mind No ocean no life support system I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said There it is The World Bank That's where all the assets are And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment With every drop of water you drink every breath you take you're connected to the sea No matter where on Earth you live Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea Over time most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there mostly by microbes The ocean drives climate and weather stabilizes temperature shapes Earth's chemistry Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain sleet and snow and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world maybe in the universe No water no life; no blue no green Yet we have this idea we humans that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it That may have been true 10，000 years ago and maybe even 1，000 years ago but in the last 100 especially in the last 50 we've drawn down the assets the air the water the wildlife that make our lives possible New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening showing us our impact on the Earth I mean first you have to know that you've got a problem And fortunately in our time we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history And with knowing comes caring And with caring there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us But first we have to know Three years ago I met John Hanke who's the head of Google Earth and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously But I asked him: When are you going to finish it You did a great job with the land the dirt What about the water Since then I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers with DOER Marine with National Geographic with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world ones that we could enlist to put the ocean in Google Earth And as of just this week last Monday Google Earth is now whole Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center we can find the nearby aquarium we can look at where we're sitting and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium the ocean and California's four national marine sanctuaries and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface but also what's below To see -- wait a minute we can go kshhplash -- right there ha -- under the ocean see what the whales see We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down the Mariana Trench where only two people have ever been Imagine that It's only seven miles but only two people have been there 49 years ago One-way trips are easy We need new deep-diving submarines How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration We need to see deep trenches the undersea mountains and understand life in the deep sea We can now go to the Arctic Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century That's bad news for the polar bears That's bad news for us too Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming it's also changing ocean chemistry making the sea more acidic That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton Also it's bad news for us We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets gear that continues to kill We're clogging the ocean poisoning the planet's circulatory system and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife all carbon-based units Barbarically we're killing sharks for shark fin soup undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle the nitrogen cycle the oxygen cycle the water cycle -- our life support system We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead All of these parts are part of our life support system We kill using long lines with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers taking everything in their path Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China the North Sea the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system leaving plumes of death in their path The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi or swordfish steak or shrimp cocktail whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost For every pound that goes to market more than 10 pounds even 100 pounds may be thrown away as bycatch This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 The highest concentrations are in red In my lifetime imagine 90 percent of the big fish have been killed Most of the turtles sharks tunas and whales are way down in numbers But there is good news Ten percent of the big fish still remain There are still some blue whales There are still some krill in Antarctica There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet There's still time but not a lot to turn things around But business as usual means that in 50 years there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing because the fish will simply be gone Imagine the ocean without fish Imagine what that means to our life support system Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too but the problems are more obvious and some actions are being taken to protect trees watersheds and wildlife And in 1872 with Yellowstone National Park the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity providing a carbon sink generating oxygen protecting watersheds And in 1972 this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea National Marine Sanctuaries That's another great idea The good news is that there are now more than 4，000 places in the sea around the world that have some kind of protection And you can find them on Google Earth The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them In the last three years for example the U。S protected 340，000 square miles of ocean as national monuments But it only increased from 0。6 of one percent to 0。8 of one percent of the ocean protected globally Protected areas do rebound but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish sharks or sea bass or 200-year-old orange roughy We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life or the census of marine life will live not just as a list a photograph or a paragraph With scientists around the world I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining and drilling and dumping and whatever -- to search out hope spots and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance right now to get it right Or the Antarctic where the continent is protected but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill whales and fish Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf which is now in serious trouble The high seas where whales tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest least protected ecosystem on Earth filled with luminous creatures living in dark waters that average two miles deep They flash and sparkle and glow with their own living light There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child The next 10 years may be the most important and the next 10，000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life To cope with climate change we need new ways to generate power We need new ways better ways to cope with poverty wars and disease We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place But nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean Our fate and the ocean's are one We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above A global plan of action with a world conservation union the IUCN is underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change on the high seas and in coastal areas wherever we can identify critical places New technologies are needed to map photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see The goal is to protect biodiversity to provide stability and resilience We need deep-diving subs new technologies to explore the ocean We need maybe an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps And so I suppose you want to know what my wish is I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films expeditions the web new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean the blue heart of the planet How much Some say 10 percent some say 30 percent You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect Whatever it is a fraction of one percent is not enough My wish is a big wish but if we can make it happen it can truly change the world and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species; that would be us For the children of today for tomorrow's child: as never again now is the time Thank you I normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war But today I've got a personal story to share with you This is a picture of my family my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977 And we're actually Cambodians And this picture is taken in Vietnam So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977 Well to explain that I've got a short video clip to explain the Khmer Rouge regime during 1975 and 1979 April 17th 1975 The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam and American bombing campaigns Led by peasant-born Pol Pot the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside in order to create a rural communist utopia much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world But after four years the grim truth seeps out In a country of only seven million people one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields Sophal Ear: So notwithstanding the 1970s narration on April 17th 1975 we lived in Phnom Penh And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge They were young soldiers typically child soldiers And this is very normal now of modern day conflict because they're easy to bring into wars The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off I mean from 1965 to 1973 there were more munitions that fell on Cambodia than in all of World War II Japan including the two nuclear bombs of August 1945 The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed But not just that they actually banned money I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used And we know money is the root of all evil but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia in fact My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province This is a picture of what Pursat looks like It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia where rice growing takes place And in fact they were forced to work the fields So my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp labor camp And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam And she spoke some Vietnamese as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends And she decided despite the advice of her neighbors that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive because at this point they're forcing everybody to work And they're giving about -- in a modern-day caloric-restriction diet I guess -- they're giving porridge with a few grains of rice And at about this time actually my father got very sick And he didn't speak Vietnamese So he died actually in January 1976 And it made it possible in fact for us to take on this plan So the Khmer Rouge took us from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev which is across from the border from Vietnam And there they had a detention camp where alleged Vietnamese would be tested language tested And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names But she'd given the boys girls' names and the girls boys' names And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady who told her this and then tutored her for two days intensively that she was able to go into her exam and -- you know this was a moment of truth If she fails we're all headed to the gallows; if she passes we can leave to Vietnam And she actually of course -- I'm here she passes And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side And then onwards to Chau Doc And this is a picture of Hong Ngu Vietnam today A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta But for us it meant freedom And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge Last year the Khmer Rouge Tribunal which the U。N is helping Cambodia take on started and I decided that as a matter of record I should file a Civil Complaint with the Tribunal about my father's passing away And I got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal And it's for me a matter of justice for history and accountability for the future because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place at times Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc And she was able to return to a place that for her meant freedom but also fear because we had just come out of Cambodia I'm happy actually today to present her She's here today with us in the audience Thank you mother I'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life But I want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man This is Hermann Goering Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II his designated successor And like Hitler Goering fancied himself a collector of art He went through Europe through World War II stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer Hitler had two of them and he didn't have any So he finally found an art dealer a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren who sold him a wonderful Vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars And it was his favorite artwork ever World War II came to an end and Goering was captured tried at Nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death Then the Allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam and arrested Van Meegeren Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason which is itself punishable by death Six weeks into his prison sentence van Meegeren confessed But he didn't confess to treason He said I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi I painted it myself; I'm a forger Now nobody believed him And he said I'll prove it Bring me a canvas and some paint and I will paint a Vermeer much better than I sold that disgusting Nazi I also need alcohol and morphine because it's the only way I can work So they brought him in He painted a beautiful Vermeer And then the charges of treason were dropped He had a lesser charge of forgery got a year sentence and died a hero to the Dutch people There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren but I want to turn now to Goering who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg Now Goering was by all accounts a terrible man Even for a Nazi he was a terrible man His American interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath But you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery According to his biographer He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world And he killed himself soon afterwards He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that It looked the same but it had a different origin it was a different artwork It wasn't just him who was in for a shock Once van Meegeren was on trial he couldn't stop talking And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists In particular The Supper at Emmaus which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece his best work -- people would come from all over the world to see it -- was actually a forgery It was not that painting but that painting And when that was discovered it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum Why does this matter I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much Why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from Well there's an answer that many people would give Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs because we're focused on status Among other things if you want to show off how rich you are how powerful you are it's always better to own an original than a forgery because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries I don't doubt that that plays some role but what I want to convince you of today is that there's something else going on I want to convince you that humans are to some extent natural born essentialists What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them or feel them or hear them Rather our response is conditioned on our beliefs about what they really are what they came from what they're made of what their hidden nature is I want to suggest that this is true not just for how we think about things but how we react to things So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep -- and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences So take food Would you eat this Well a good answer is It depends What is it Some of you would eat it if it's pork but not beef Some of you would eat it if it's beef but not pork Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu That's not so surprising But what's more interesting is how it tastes to you will depend critically on what you think you're eating So one demonstration of this was done with young children How do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk -- to think they taste better It's simple you tell them they're from McDonald's They believe McDonald's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier How do you get adults to really enjoy wine It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle There are now dozens perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff it tastes better to you This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist They get people into a fMRI scanner and while they're lying there through a tube they get to sip wine In front of them on a screen is information about the wine Everybody of course drinks exactly the same wine But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable you say you like it more you really experience it in a different way Or take sex These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies And if you simply show people these pictures they'll say these are fairly attractive people But how attractive you find them how sexually or romantically moved you are by them rests critically on who you think you're looking at You probably think the picture on the left is male the one on the right is female If that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are It will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter your mother or father Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance If you like somebody they look better to you This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do A particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome So Capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion Sufferers of Capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates Now often a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic People have murdered those that they loved believing that they were murdering an imposter But there's at least one case where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending This was recorded in 1931 Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover But that was before she got Capgras syndrome After she got it She was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich virile handsome and aristocratic Of course it was the same man but she was seeing him in different ways As a third example consider consumer products So one reason why you might like something is its utility You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs; and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you But each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history The golf clubs were owned by John F Kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars And in fact there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all According to an unconfirmed report a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes They were the ones thrown at George Bush at an Iraqi press conference several years ago Now this attraction to objects doesn't just work for celebrity objects Each one of us most people have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable in that it has value because of its history -- maybe your wedding ring maybe your child's baby shoes -- so that if it was lost you couldn't get it back You could get something that looked like it or felt like it but you couldn't get the same object back With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck we've looked to see what sort of factors what sort of history matters for the objects that people like So in one of our experiments we asked people to name a famous person who they adored a living person they adored So one answer was George Clooney Then we asked them How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater And the answer is a fair amount -- more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions So for instance we told some people Look you can buy the sweater but you can't tell anybody you own it and you can't resell it That drops the value of it suggesting that that's one reason why we like it But what really causes an effect is you tell people Look you could resell it you could boast about it but before it gets to you it's thoroughly washed That causes a huge drop in the value As my wife put it You've washed away the Clooney cooties So let's go back to art I would love a Chagall I love the work of Chagall If people want to get me something at the end of the conference you could buy me a Chagall But I don't want a duplicate even if I can't tell the difference That's not because or it's not simply because I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original Rather it's because I want something that has a specific history In the case of artwork the history is special indeed The philosopher Denis Dutton in his wonderful book The Art Instinct makes the case that The value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation And that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery They may look alike but they have a different history The original is typically the product of a creative act the forgery isn't I think this approach can explain differences in people's taste in art This is a work by Jackson Pollock Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock Okay Who here it does nothing for them They just don't like it I'm not going to make a claim about who's right but I will make an empirical claim about people's intuitions which is that if you like the work of Jackson Pollock you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example because there's a young American artist who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars -- in large part because she's a very young artist This is Marla Olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house to film her painting And they then reported that her father was coaching her When this came out on television the value of her art dropped to nothing It was the same art physically but the history had changed I've been focusing now on the visual arts but I want to give two examples from music This is Joshua Bell a very famous violinist And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell the music of Joshua Bell if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin down to a Washington D。C subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make And here's a brief clip of this After being there for three-quarters of an hour he made 32 dollars Not bad It's also not good Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell He actually made 20 dollars more than that but he didn't count it Because this woman comes up -- you see at the end of the video -- she comes up She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black-tie affair So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station So she's struck with pity She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20 The second example from music is from John Cage's modernist composition 4'33 As many of you know this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds -- that period of silence And people have different views on this But what I want to point out is you can buy this from iTunes For a dollar 99 you can listen to that silence which is different than other forms of silence Now I've been talking so far about pleasure but what I want to suggest is that everything I've said applies as well to pain And how you think about what you're experiencing your beliefs about the essence of it affect how it hurts One lovely experiment was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates to an electric shock machine And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks So it was a series of five painful shocks Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks by somebody in another room but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks There's no malevolence they're just pressing a button The first shock is recorded as very painful The second shock feels less painful because you get a bit used to it The third drops the fourth the fifth The pain gets less In the other condition they're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them The first shock hurts like hell The second shock hurts just as much and the third and the fourth and the fifth It hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose The most extreme example of this is that in some cases pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low-level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it -- as in the eating of hot chili peppers and roller coaster rides The point was nicely summarized by the poet John Milton who wrote The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven And I'll end with that Thank you I wanted to be a rock star I dreamed of it and that's all I dreamed of To be more accurate I wanted to be a pop star This was in the late '80s And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran They wouldn't have me I didn't read music but I played synthesizers and drum machines And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada And I was certain that's what my life would be And when I went to college at the University of Nevada Las Vegas when I was 18 I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101 or even a degree program for that interest And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir And I said Yes I would love to do that It sounds great And I left the room and said No way The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people And about a week later a friend of mine came to me and said Listen you've got to join choir At the end of the semester we're taking a trip to Mexico all expenses paid And the soprano section is just full of hot girls And so I figured for Mexico and babes I could do just about anything And I went to my first day in choir and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing They opened their scores the conductor gave the downbeat and boom they launched into the Kyrie from the Requiem by Mozart In my entire life I had seen in black and white and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor The most transformative experience I've ever had -- in that single moment hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing people together the shared vision And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section as it turns out I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life I had learned to read music by then or slowly learning to read music And that piece was published and then I wrote another piece and that got published And then I started conducting and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor Well a couple of years ago a friend of mine emailed me a link a YouTube link and said You have got to see this And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called Sleep Britlin Losee: Hi Mr Eric Whitacre My name is Britlin Losee and this is a video that I'd like to make for you Here's me singing Sleep I'm a little nervous just to let you know If there are noises in the night Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck Britlin was so innocent and so sweet and her voice was so pure And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room Such an intimate video And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing sing their parts -- soprano alto tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world post their videos to YouTube we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir So I wrote on my blog OMG OMG I actually wrote OMG hopefully for the last time in public ever And I sent out this call to singers And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called Lux Aurumque which means light and gold And lo and behold people started uploading their videos Now I should say before that what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting And it's in complete silence when I filmed it because I was only hearing the music in my head imagining the choir that would one day come to be Afterwards I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to And then as the videos started to come in 。。 This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts Stephen Hanson from Sweden This is Jamal Walker from Dallas Texas There was even a little soprano solo in the piece and so I had auditions And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts I was told later and also by lots of singers who were involved in this that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it Here's our winner of the soprano solo This is Melody Myers from Tennessee I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like No problem everything's fine And from the crowd emerged this young man Scott Haines And he said Listen this is the project I've been looking for my whole life I'd like to be the person to edit this all together I said Thank you Scott I'm so glad that you found me And Scott aggregated all of the videos He scrubbed the audio He made sure that everything lined up And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago This is Lux Aurumque sung by the Virtual Choir I'll stop it there in the interest of time Thank you Thank you Thank you So there's more There's more Thank you so much And I had the same reaction you did I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island sending electronic messages in bottles to each other And the video went viral We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it And because of that then a lot of singers started saying All right what's Virtual Choir 2。0 And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2。0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing Sleep which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri And again I posted a conductor video and we started accepting submissions This time we got some more mature members And some younger members Soprano: Upon my pillow Safe in bed EW: That's Georgie from England She's only nine Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts This is Beau Awtin Beau Awtin: Safe in bed EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang Lollipop and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody And there were 900 people involved in that So I told the singers That's our goal That's the number for us to beat And we just closed submissions January 10th and our final tally was 2，051 videos from 58 different countries Thank you From Malta Madagascar Thailand Vietnam Jordan Egypt Israel as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials what it was like for them their experience singing it And I've just chosen a few of them here My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling It's so wonderful to sing together again I love the idea that she's singing with her sister Aside from the beautiful music it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before but who are connected anyway And my personal favorite When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this he told me that I did not have the voice for it Yeah I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too Me too It hurt so much and I shed some tears but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words It is a dream come true to be part of this choir as I've never been part of one When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map I had to go with the nearest city which is about 400 miles away from where I live As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush satellite is my connection to the world So two things struck me deeply about this The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other It doesn't matter the technology And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection It wasn't a virtual choir There are people now online that are friends; they've never met But I know myself too I feel this virtual esprit de corps if you will with all of them I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at Sleep by Virtual Choir 2。0 This will be a premiere today We're not finished with the video yet You can imagine with 2，000 synchronized YouTube videos the render time is just atrocious But we do have the first three minutes And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first You're the very first people to see this This is Sleep the Virtual Choir Virtual Choir: The evening hangs beneath the moon A silver thread on darkened dune With closing eyes and resting head I know that sleep is coming soon Upon my pillow safe in bed a thousand pictures fill my head I cannot sleep my mind's aflight and yet my limbs seem made of lead If there are noises in the night Eric Whitacre: Thank you very very much Thank you Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Like many of you here I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent I want to tell you some stories that explain my view We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital The emergency generators did not start There was not a flashlight not a lantern not a candle -- pitch black The patient's cut open twice The first time it was a C-section Thankfully baby was out -- mother and child survived The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia Anesthetic wears off The patient feels pain He's crying He's screaming He's praying Pitch black Not a candle not a flashlight And that hospital could have afforded flashlights They could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn't And it happened twice Another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had And so three months later just before she returned to the United States nurses in Accra go on strike And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again Start all over again Now what does this have to do with leadership You see the folks at the ministry of health the hospital administrators the doctors the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school They are the elite They are our leaders Their decisions their actions matter And when they fail a nation literally suffers So when I speak of leadership I'm not talking about just political leaders We've heard a lot about that I'm talking about the elite Those who've been trained whose job it is to be the guardians of their society The lawyers the judges the policemen the doctors the engineers the civil servants -- those are the leaders And we need to train them right Now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old We had just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our society They were a pervasive presence And one day I go to the airport to meet my father and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment Why Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds No sign to this effect Now I was 16 I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill I was especially concerned of what the girls might think And so I started to argue with these men It was a little reckless but you know I was 16 I got lucky A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament Because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him that they're just following orders So he takes their radio talks to their boss and gets us all released What lessons would you take from an experience like this Several for me Leadership matters Those men are following the orders of a superior officer I learned something about courage It was important not to look at those guns And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls So a few years after this event I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education It was a breath of fresh air You know the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana They wanted us to think critically They wanted us to be analytical They wanted us to be concerned about social issues In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics But I learned something more profound than that which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy -- were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters It matters a great deal But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore I had an inkling but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation And I was part of this team -- this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world And it was brilliant to be part of this team It was brilliant And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore this transformation -- the ability to confront problems complex problems and to design solutions to those problems The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual And I was part of that Now while I was at Microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana And by the way it's continued to The gap has widened since I left Now I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred I mean it's the people there who are so hardworking persistent creative empowered But there were also some external factors: free markets the rule of law infrastructure These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously Somebody trained them to do the work that they do Now while I was at Microsoft this funny thing happened I became a parent And for the first time Africa mattered more to me than ever before Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children That the state of the world -- the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa as far as my kids would be concerned And at this time when I was going through what I call my pre-mid-life crisis Africa was a mess Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction and I needed to be back helping I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in So I decided to get engaged and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were And three things kept coming up for every problem: corruption weak institutions and the people who run them -- the leaders Now I was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with And they might say Look don't even try But for me I asked the question Well where are these leaders coming from What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system And it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school Very little emphasis on ethics and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility This is wrong So I decided to engage this particular problem Because it seems to me that every society every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders And Ghana was not paying enough attention And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa actually So this is what I'm doing now I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country I think it would make a huge difference And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leaders We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions I'll admit that there are times when it seems like Mission: Impossible but we must believe that these kids are smart That if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront -- that our whole society confronts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen Now a month into this project we'd just started classes And a month into it I come to the office and I have this email from one of our students And it said very simply I am thinking now And he signs off Thank you It's such a simple statement But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way I am thinking now This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart Can we create a perfect society Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible Now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence I don't know ultimately what they will do I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing Am I out of time OK Now I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it I'm very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate That for many of them it has been a life-altering experience These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve humanity I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university It says a lot about her It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus It says a lot about her peers who elected her She won with 75 percent of the vote And it gives me a lot of hope It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students We've graduated two classes of students to date And every single one of them has been placed And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana corporate West Africa and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic You know that passion for what they're doing The persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before This is good because over the past five years there have been times when I've felt this is Mission: Impossible And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent It's an incredible opportunity There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation It will depend on inspired leadership And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference Thank you and God bless One day in 1819 3，000 miles off the coast of Chile in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean 20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater They'd been struck by a sperm whale which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull As their ship began to sink beneath the swells the men huddled together in three small whaleboats These men were 10，000 miles from home more than 1，000 miles from the nearest scrap of land In their small boats they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water These were the men of the whaleship Essex whose story would later inspire parts of Moby Dick Even in today's world their situation would be really dire but think about how much worse it would have been then No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong No search party was coming to look for these men So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves but we all know what it's like to be afraid We know how fear feels but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean As we grow up we're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates And I think it's no accident that we think this way Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard-wired to be optimists So maybe that's why we think of fear sometimes as a danger in and of itself Don't worry we like to say to one another Don't panic In English fear is something we conquer It's something we fight It's something we overcome But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid When I was a child I lived in California which is you know mostly a very nice place to live but for me as a child California could also be a little scary I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination But at a certain point most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed and not every earthquake brings buildings down But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults The same incredible imaginations that produced The Origin of Species Jane Eyre and The Remembrance of Things Past also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust So the question is what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship The time had come for the men to make a plan but they had very few options In his fascinating account of the disaster Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands 1，200 miles away But they'd heard some frightening rumors They'd been told that these islands and several others nearby were populated by cannibals So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner Another possible destination was Hawaii but given the season the captain was afraid they'd be struck by severe storms Now the last option was the longest and the most difficult: to sail 1，500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water To be eaten by cannibals to be battered by storms to starve to death before reaching land These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men and as it turned out the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name What if instead of calling them fears we called them stories Because that's really what fear is if you think about it It's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do And fears and storytelling have the same components They have the same architecture Like all stories fears have characters In our fears the characters are us Fears also have plots They have beginnings and middles and ends You board the plane The plane takes off The engine fails Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel Picture a cannibal human teeth sinking into human skin human flesh roasting over a fire Fears also have suspense If I've done my job as a storyteller today you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense Just like all great stories our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature: What will happen next In other words our fears make us think about the future And humans by the way are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way of projecting ourselves forward in time and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling As a writer I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events and fear works in that same way In fear just like in fiction one thing always leads to another When I was writing my first novel The Age Of Miracles I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down What would happen to our days What would happen to our crops What would happen to our minds And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night If an earthquake strikes tonight I used to worry what will happen to our house What will happen to my family And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories But just as importantly we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives Now some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called productive paranoia which meant that these people instead of dismissing their fears these people read them closely they studied them and then they translated that fear into preparation and action So that way if their worst fears came true their businesses were ready And sometimes of course our worst fears do come true That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear Once in a while our fears can predict the future But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating if tragic example After much deliberation the men finally made a decision Terrified of cannibals they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America After more than two months at sea the men ran out of food as they knew they might and they were still quite far from land When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships less than half of the men were left alive and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism Herman Melville who used this story as research for Moby Dick wrote years later and from dry land quote All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they immediately after leaving the wreck steered straight for Tahiti But as Melville put it they dreaded cannibals So the question is why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other Looked at from this angle theirs becomes a story about reading The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments the artistic and the scientific A good reader has an artist's passion a willingness to get caught up in the story but just as importantly the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist which acts to temper and complicate the reader's intuitive reactions to the story As we've seen the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios The problem was that they listened to the wrong story Of all the narratives their fears wrote they responded only to the most lurid the most vivid the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture: cannibals But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist with more coolness of judgment they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale the story of starvation and headed for Tahiti just as Melville's sad commentary suggests And maybe if we all tried to read our fears we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face: the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries the gradual changes in our climate Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest so too might our subtlest fears be the truest Read in the right way our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination a kind of everyday clairvoyance a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out Properly read our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature: a little wisdom a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth Thank you Unless we do something to prevent it over the next 40 years we're facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale A cheery thought On this map every country that's colored blue has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65 This is the world we live in And this is the world your children will live in For 12，000 years the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid with the oldest on top It's already flattening out By 2050 it's going to be a column and will start to invert This is why it's happening The average lifespan's more than doubled since 1840 and it's increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day And this is why that's not entirely a good thing: because over the age of 65 your risk of getting Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will increase exponentially By 2050 there'll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80 and unless we do something about it half of them will have Alzheimer's disease and three million more will have Parkinson's disease Right now those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 Alzheimer's disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami So one approach we're taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do Interestingly enough other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein which suggests that the approach might be a general one and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases not just Alzheimer's disease There's also a fascinating connection to cancer here because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers And this is a connection that most people aren't pursuing right now but which we're fascinated by Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies And there's tremendous scope for additional private help here because the government has dropped the ball on much of this I'm afraid In the meantime while we're waiting for all these things to happen here's what you can do for yourself If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson's disease caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why Head injuries are bad for you They lead to Parkinson's disease And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer's disease well it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease You should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer's disease It's also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma which is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye And of course when it comes to cognitive effects use it or lose it applies so you want to stay mentally stimulated But hey you're listening to me So you've got that covered And one final thing Wish people like me luck okay Because the clock is ticking for all of us Thank you Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today 10 calories are taken to produce it That's a lot I want to take something rather humble to discuss I found this in the farmers' market today and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you're very welcome to The humble potato -- and I've spent a long time 25 years preparing these And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime First of all it's planted and that takes energy It grows and is nurtured It's then harvested It's then distributed and distribution is a massive issue It's then sold and bought and it's then delivered to me I basically take it prepare it and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it The last stage is basically waste and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it There are different types of waste There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy; and there's a waste of waste And every business I've been working on over the past five years I'm trying to lower each one of these elements Okay so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like Basically a restaurant just like any other This is the restaurant Acorn House Front and back So let me run you through a few ideas Floor: sustainable recyclable Chairs: recycled and recyclable Tables: Forestry Commission This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood This bench although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing a job that was pretty good I hate waste especially walls If they're not working put a shelf on it which I did and that shows all the customers my products The whole business is run on sustainable energy This is powered by wind All of the lights are daylight bulbs Paint is all low-volume chemical which is very important when you're working in the room all the time I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there And that's a plastic polymer And I was thinking well I'm trying to think nature nature nature But I thought no no experiment with resins experiment with polymers Will they outlive me They probably might Right here's a reconditioned coffee machine It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there Now reusing is vital And we filter our own water We put them in bottles refrigerate them and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again Here's a great little example If you can see this orange tree it's actually growing in a car tire which has been turned inside out and sewn up It's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is great This is the kitchen which is in the same room I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume Rather than me putting a dish down they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted Okay it's a small kitchen It's about five square meters It serves 220 people a day We generate quite a lot of waste This is the waste room You can't get rid of waste But this story's not about eliminating it it's about minimizing it In here I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable I put my food waste into this dehydrating desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material which I can store and then compost later I compost it in this garden All of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it's growing in these tubs which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good makes fantastic compost A couple of wormeries in there too And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery I had a lot of worms in it And I tried taking the dried food waste putting it to the worms going There you go dinner It was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them I don't know how many worms were in there but I've got some heavy karma coming I tell you What you're seeing here is a water filtration system This takes the water out of the restaurant runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it And I ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with it I don't know So water is a very important aspect I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great I managed to do it This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs same tables They're all English and a little bit more sustainable But this is an electrical restaurant The whole thing is electric the restaurant and the kitchen And it's run on hydroelectricity so I've gone from air to water Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water heated by water filters its own water and it's powered by water It literally is Waterhouse The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there This is basically air-handling I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant cooling them or heating them as the need may be And this is an English willow air diffuser and that's softly moving that air current through the room Very advanced no air-conditioning -- I love it In the canal which is just outside the restaurant there is hundreds of meters of coil piping This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange I have no idea how it works but I paid a lot of money for it And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power He's growing all his own fruit and that's fantastic There's no accident in names of these restaurants Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water; and I'm thinking well I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities I've got water and wood I'm just about to do fire I've got metal and earth to come So you've got to watch your space for that Okay So this is my next project Five weeks old it's my baby and it's hurting real bad The People's Supermarket So basically the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people So people -- i。e。 perhaps more working-class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative This is a social enterprise not-for-profit cooperative supermarket It really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -- connecting communities in London to rural growers Really important So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk; I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors; I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges; I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys I mean the whole thing is is super-sustainable In fact I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world That's zero food waste And no one's doing that just yet In fact Sainsbury's if you're watching let's have a go Try it on I'm going to get there before you So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time and it's an important statement to understand If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we may fail But I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible Environmentally conscious businesses are doable They're here You can see I've done three so far; I've got a few more to go The idea is embryonic I think it's important I think that if we reduce reuse refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make; but it's the four R's rather than the three R's -- then I think we're going to be on our way So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas I think that there are many problems to come but with help I'm sure I'm going to find solutions And I hope you all take part Thank you very much I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota Many of you may have heard of the Lakota or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps now called reservations The Pine Ridge Reservation the subject of today's slide show is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334 and it is where the Lakota now live Now if any of you have ever heard of AIM the American Indian Movement or of Russell Means or Leonard Peltier or of the stand-off at Oglala then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U。S So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota and that's a very difficult one for me Because if you haven't noticed from my skin color I'm white and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today and I've become very close with them and they've welcomed me like family They've called me brother and uncle and invited me again and again over five years But on Pine Ridge I will always be what is called wasichu and wasichu is a Lakota word that means non-Indian but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat for himself And that's what I want to focus on -- the one who takes the best part of the meat It means greedy So take a look around this auditorium today We are at a private school in the American West sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets And if we look at our lives we have indeed taken the best part of the meat So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family The following is a time-line of treaties made treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles I'll begin in 1824 What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans 1851: The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation According to the treaty those lands are a sovereign nation If the boundaries of this treaty had held -- and there is a legal basis that they should -- then this is what the U。S would look like today 10 years later the Homestead Act signed by President Lincoln unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands 1863: An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men the largest mass execution in U。S history The execution was ordered by President Lincoln only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation 1866: the beginning of the transcontinental railroad -- a new era We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation The treaties were out the window In response three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U。S army many times over I want to repeat that part The Lakota defeat the U。S army 1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux In fact this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy 1869: The transcontinental railroad was completed It began carrying among other things a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux 1871: The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government In addition the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war Also in 1871 we ended the time of treaty-making The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations and we can't have that We had plans 1874: General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory specifically the Black Hills The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible 1875: The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty 1876: On July 26th on its way to attack a Lakota village Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn 1877: The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson He was later killed while in custody 1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve: Sign the paper or no food for your tribe Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land That clause was obviously ignored 1887: The Dawes Act Communal ownership of reservation lands ends Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of Tribes lost millions of acres The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left The move destroyed the reservations making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers Once again the fat of the land goes to wasichu 1890 a date I believe to be the most important in this slide show This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre On December 29th U。S troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun For this so-called battle 20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor were given to the 7th Cavalry To this day this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One World War Two Korea Vietnam Iraq or Afghanistan The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux but as a grave for all indigenous peoples The holy man Black Elk said I did not know then how much was ended When I look back now from this high hill of my old age I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard: A people's dream died there and it was a beautiful dream With this event a new era in Native American history began Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after Because it was in this moment with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns that the U。S government openly declared its position on Native rights They were tired of treaties They were tired of sacred hills They were tired of ghost dances And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux So they brought out their cannons You want to be an Indian now they said finger on the trigger 1900: the U。S Indian population reached its low point -- less than 250，000 compared to an estimated eight million in 1492 Fast-forward 1980: The longest running court case in U。S history the Sioux Nation v the United States was ruled upon by the U。S Supreme Court The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken and that the initial offering price plus interest should be paid to the Sioux Nation As payment for the Black Hills the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry The Black Hills are not for sale 2010: Statistics about Native population today more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee reveal the legacy of colonization forced migration and treaty violations Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent The housing office is unable to build new structures and existing structures are falling apart Many are homeless and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families 39 percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the U。S national average The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the U。S national average Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U。S national average School dropout rate is up to 70 percent Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the U。S national average Frequently grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents due to alcoholism domestic violence and general apathy cannot raise them 50 percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes The life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old -- roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia The last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can remove their hands and say My God what are these people doing to themselves They're killing each other They're killing themselves while we watch them die This is how we came to own these United States This is the legacy of manifest destiny Prisoners are still born into prisoner-of-war camps long after the guards are gone These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken A long time ago a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me by wasichu eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end As removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in 1890 or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago I still have to ask you the question how should you feel about the statistics of today What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you And how much of this history do you need to own even Is any of this your responsibility today I have been told that there must be something we can do There must be some call to action Because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines content to be a witness just taking photographs Because the solution seems so far in the past I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix It's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti or ending AIDS or fighting a famine The fix as it's called may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a $50 check or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore So where does that leave us Shrugging our shoulders in the dark The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota The call to action I offer today -- my TED wish -- is this: Honor the treaties Give back the Black Hills It's not your business what they do with them One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life So when I thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he's lying there and he says I really understand and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them This in a way is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea We all I think believe in compassion If you look at all the world religions all the main world religions you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion So in Judaism we have from our Torah that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself And within Jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings we have Hillel who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself And all the main religions have similar teachings And again within Judaism we have a teaching about God who is called the compassionate one Ha-rachaman After all how could the world exist without God being compassionate And we as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God so we too have to be compassionate But what does it mean How does it impact on our everyday life Sometimes of course being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral or when I have been sitting with the bereaved or with people who are dying and I am overwhelmed by the sadness by the difficulty the challenge that is there for the family for the person And I'm touched so that tears come to my eyes And yet if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings I wouldn't be doing my job -- because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen that practicalities are seen to And yet on the other hand if I didn't feel this compassion then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war or famine or earthquakes or tsunamis I know some people who say Well you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything I'm not going to even begin to try And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore and so they turn off the television and don't watch In Judaism though we tend to always say there has to be a middle way You have to of course be aware of the needs of others but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick And of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation which says that when God created the world God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice Because after all God is just Therefore there should be justice throughout the world And then God looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice the world couldn't exist So God thought Nope I'm going to create the world just with compassion And then God looked to the future and realized that in fact if the world were just filled with compassion there would be anarchy and chaos There had to be limits to all things The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful fragile glass bowl If you put too much cold water in it will shatter If you put boiling water in it will shatter What do you have to do Put in a mixture of the two And so God put both of these possibilities into the world There is something more though that has to be there And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world into action So like Snoopy we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors We actually have to do something about it And so there is also within Judaism this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: chesed All these three things then have to be melded together The idea of justice which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life what's right about living what should we be doing social justice There has to be a willingness to do good deeds but not of course at the expense of our own sanity You know there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion which has to be there if you like at our very roots This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God who is ultimately the compassionate one What does this compassion entail It entails understanding the pain of the other But even more than that it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation that there is a unity that underlies all that we see all that we hear all that we feel I call that unity God And that unity is something that connects all of creation And of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things that something I do here actually does matter in Africa that if I use too much of my carbon allowance it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa So there is a connectivity and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation as part of me being made in the image of God And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs This 18 minutes business I find quite fascinating Because in Judaism the number 18 in Hebrew letters stands for life -- the word life So in a sense the 18 minutes is challenging me to say In life this is what's important in terms of compassion But something else as well: actually 18 minutes is important Because at Passover when we have to eat unleavened bread the rabbis say what is the difference between dough that is made into bread and dough that is made into unleavened bread or matzah And they say It's 18 minutes Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven What does it mean dough becomes leaven It means it gets filled with hot air What's matzah What's unleavened bread You don't get it Symbolically what the rabbis say is that at Passover what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve round us So we try and get rid of those and so doing try to get rid of the habits the emotions the ideas that enslave us that make our eyes closed give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others -- and free ourselves and free ourselves from that And that too is a basis for having compassion for understanding our place in the world Now there is in Judaism a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day And as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon And as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem the priests used to have bread which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem The man was asleep but he heard the words bread temple God and he woke up He said God wants bread That's it God wants bread I know what God wants And he rushed home And after the Sabbath he made 12 loaves of bread took them to the synagogue went into the synagogue opened the ark and said God I don't know why you want this bread but here you are And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah Then he went home The cleaner came into the synagogue Oh God I'm in such trouble I've got children to feed My wife's ill I've got no money What can I do He goes into the synagogue God will you please help me Ah what a wonderful smell He goes to the ark He opens the ark There's bread God you've answered my plea You've answered my question Takes the bread and goes home Meanwhile the rich man thinks to himself I'm an idiot God wants bread God the one who rules the entire universe wants my bread He rushes to the synagogue I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it He goes in there and it's not there And he says God you really did want it You wanted my bread Next week with raisins This went on for years Every week the man would bring bread with raisins with all sorts of good things put it into the ark Every week the cleaner would come God you've answered my plea again Take the bread Take it home Went on until a new rabbi came Rabbis always spoil things The rabbi came in and saw what was going on And he called the two of them to his office And he said you know This is what's happening And the rich man -- oh dear -- crestfallen You mean God didn't want my bread And the poor man said And you mean God didn't answer my pleas And the rabbi said You've misunderstood me You've misunderstood totally he said Of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate And God he said to the poor man is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give He looked at the rich man He held the rich man's hands and said Don't you understand He said These are the hands of God So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate of understanding that there is a connectivity that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity and that I can try and do that by understanding I hope trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy to the giving I can give I have to reevaluate them try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me so that I can see the world clearly And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God And so try to bring compassion to life in this world Sarge Salman: All the way from Los Altos Hills California Mr Henry Evans Henry Evans: Hello My name is Henry Evans and until August 29 2002 I was living my version of the American dream I grew up in a typical American town near St Louis My dad was a lawyer My mom was a homemaker My six siblings and I were good kids but caused our fair share of trouble After high school I left home to study and learn more about the world I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German including spending a year of study in Austria Later on I earned an MBA at Stanford I married my high school sweetheart Jane I am lucky to have her Together we raised four wonderful children I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley a job I really enjoyed My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13 2001 a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills California from where I am speaking to you now We were looking forward to rebuilding it but eight months after we moved in I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect Overnight I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 It took me several years but with the help of an incredibly supportive family I finally decided life was still worth living I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements and enable my use of a regular computer I can surf the web exchange email with people and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games This technology allows me to remain engaged mentally active and feel like I am a part of the world One day I was lying in bed watching CNN when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage and we formed the Robots for Humanity project For about two years Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years From my home in California I shaved Charlie in Atlanta I handed out Halloween candy I opened my refrigerator on my own I began doing tasks around the house I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute both for myself and others in my circumstance All of us have disabilities in one form or another For example if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour both of us will need an assistive device called a car Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person and neither does mine By the way check out my sweet ride Since birth we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own Last year Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible Using a mouse cursor I control with my head these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser With a little practice I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing I inspected the solar panels on our roof One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display the Oculus Rift as modified by Fighting Walrus to have an immersive experience controlling the drone With Chad's group at Brown I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week from my home 3，000 miles away All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own I just wish I could afford the tuition Chad Jenkins: Henry all joking aside I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3，000 miles away Okay Henry have you been to D。C lately Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic Can you show us how excited you are All right big finish Can you show us how good of a pilot you are All right we still have a little ways to go with that but I think it shows the promise What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way What we're trying to do is democratize robotics so that anybody can be a part of this We're providing affordable off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A。R drone 300 dollars the Suitable Technologies beam only 17，000 dollars along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do And our hope is that by providing these tools that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled to provide care for our aging population to help better educate our children to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future to both monitor and protect our environment and to explore the universe Back to you Henry HE: Thank you Chad With this drone setup we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else and perhaps better and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables One hundred years ago I would have been treated like a vegetable Actually that's not true I would have died It is up to us all of us to decide how robotics will be used for good or for evil for simply replacing people or for making people better for allowing us to do and enjoy more Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe With the help of people like you we can make this dream a reality Thank you I grew up in Europe and World War II caught me when I was between seven and 10 years old And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them -- how few of them could even resemble a normal contented satisfied happy life once their job their home their security was destroyed by the war So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living And I tried as a child as a teenager to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie But I found that on the -- I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich and it was about flying saucers that he was going to talk And I thought well since I can't go to the movies at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting Instead of talking about little green men he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war And this seemed very interesting to me And I started reading his books after that lecture And that was Carl Jung whose name or work I had no idea about Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness This is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it But this for instance shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy And that hasn't changed at all Whereas the personal income on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation has more than doubled almost tripled in that period But you find essentially the same results namely that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less to just a few 1，000 dollars above the minimum poverty level -- increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are In fact you can find that the lack of basic resources material resources contributes to unhappiness but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness So my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience I tried to understand: where -- in everyday life in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy And to start those studies about 40 years ago I began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune but which made their life meaningful and worth doing This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s And the interview was 40 pages long But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview And it describes how he feels when composing is going well And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state Now ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality And it's interesting if you think about it how when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it's China Greece the Hindu civilization or the Mayas or Egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies not about their everyday life We know the temples they built where people could come to experience a different reality We know about the circuses the arenas the theaters These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated more ordered form Now this man doesn't need to go to a place like this which is also -- this place this arena which is built like a Greek amphitheatre is a place for ecstasy also We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to But this man doesn't need to go there He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks and as he does that he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination So once he gets to that point of beginning to create like Jennifer did in her improvisation a new reality -- that is a moment of ecstasy -- he enters that different reality Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration But actually our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying you need to process about 60 bits per second That's why you can't hear more than two people You can't understand more than two people talking to you Well when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new as this man is he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired His body disappears his identity disappears from his consciousness because he doesn't have enough attention like none of us do to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists So existence is temporarily suspended And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself Now I could look at my hand for two weeks and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder because I can't compose So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field Whether it's mathematics or music it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before Now when that happens he says the music just flows out And because all of these people I started interviewing -- this was an interview which is over 30 years old -- so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the flow experience And it happens in different realms For instance a poet describes it in this form This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States And it describes the same effortless spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked But it happens in other activities For instance this is another student of mine Susan Jackson from Australia who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person You don't think; it goes automatically if you merge yourself with the music and so forth It happens also actually in the most recent book I wrote called Good Business where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical very socially responsible You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed She is the founder of Body Shop the natural cosmetics king It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka who was at that time starting out Sony without any money without a product -- they didn't have a product they didn't have anything but they had an idea And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace Now when we do studies -- we have with other colleagues around the world done over 8，000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks to blind nuns to Himalayan climbers to Navajo shepherds -- who enjoy their work And regardless of the culture regardless of education or whatever there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow There's this focus that once it becomes intense leads to a sense of ecstasy a sense of clarity: you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other; you get immediate feedback You know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult and sense of time disappears you forget yourself you feel part of something larger And once the conditions are present what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake In our studies we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme And we can measure this very precisely actually because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day and whenever they go off you say what you're doing how you feel where you are what you're thinking about And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment So for each person we can establish an average which is the center of the diagram That would be your mean level of challenge and skill which will be different from that of anybody else But you have a kind of a set point there which would be in the middle If we know what that set point is we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average And you may be doing things very differently from other people but for everyone that flow channel that area there will be when you are doing what you really like to do -- play the piano be with your best friend perhaps work if work is what provides flow for you And then the other areas become less and less positive Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there Your skills are not quite as high as they should be but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill So arousal is the area where most people learn from because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that -- going back to flow -- then they develop higher skills Control is also a good place to be because there you feel comfortable but not very excited It's not very challenging any more And if you want to enter flow from control you have to increase the challenges So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative: you don't feel that you're doing anything you don't use your skills there's no challenge Unfortunately a lot of people's experience is in apathy The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom sitting Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it So the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time -- is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice but unfortunately a lot of people don't And that's what our mandate is in a way to do Thank you You may want to take a closer look There's more to this painting than meets the eye And yes it's an acrylic painting of a man but I didn't paint it on canvas I painted it directly on top of the man What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether and if I want to paint your portrait I'm painting it on you physically on you That also means you're probably going to end up with an earful of paint because I need to paint your ear on your ear Everything in this scene the person the clothes chairs wall gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what's directly below it and in this way I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene and make it look like a two-dimensional painting I can photograph it from any angle and it will still look 2D There's no Photoshop here This is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings But originally this had nothing to do with either people or paint It was about shadows I was fascinated with the absence of light and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed I came up with the idea of painting shadows I loved that I could hide within this shadow my own painted version and it would be almost invisible until the light changed and all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on and I thought of my friend Bernie But I didn't just want to paint the shadows I also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale I had a very specific vision of what this would look like and as I was painting him I made sure to follow that very closely But something kept on flickering before my eyes I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at And then when I took that moment to take a step back magic I had turned my friend into a painting I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow I would pull out this whole other dimension that I would collapse it that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting I was a little conflicted though because I was so excited about what I'd found but I was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science and I'd always had this dream of going to Washington D。C。 and sitting at a desk and working in government Why did this have to get in the way of all that I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint I had no idea where to begin The last time I'd painted I was 16 years old at summer camp and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface because that's not what this project was about for me It was about space and light My early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas like fried food It's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg Even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit It just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink I'd put something down and instantly it would be gone And if I wanted to paint on people well I was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that I spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast It just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself One of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears but he also didn't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition like the Metro I was having so much fun with this process I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles and I wanted to see what else I could do with it I came together with a collaborator Sheila Vand and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface and that was milk We got a pool We filled it with milk We filled it with Sheila And I began painting And the images were always completely unexpected in the end because I could have a very specific image about how it would turn out I could paint it to match that but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk everything would change It was in constant flux and we had to rather than fight it embrace it see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better Sometimes when Sheila would lay down in the milk it would wash all the paint off of her arms and it might seem a little bit clumsy but our solution would be okay hide your arms And one time she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face All right well hide your face And we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands just hiding them in the pockets When we started out on the milk project and when I started out I couldn't have foreseen that I would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk But then again I guess it's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar as long as you're willing to look beyond what's already been brought to light that you can see what's below the surface hiding in the shadows and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye Thank you As the highest military commander of The Netherlands with troops stationed around the world I'm really honored to be here today When I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue I see a very special audience You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today When I look around I see people who want to make a contribution I see people who want to make a better world by doing groundbreaking scientific work by creating impressive works of art by writing critical articles or inspiring books by starting up sustainable businesses And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world Some chose the microscope as their instrument Others chose dancing or painting or making music like we just heard Some chose the pen Others work through the instrument of money Ladies and gentlemen I made a different choice Thanks Ladies and gentlemen -- I share your goals I share the goals of the speakers you heard before I did not choose to take up the pen the brush the camera I chose this instrument I chose the gun For you and you heard already being so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy It may even feel scary A real gun at a few feet's distance Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness You could even hear it Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you have never been close to a gun It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country The Netherlands is not at war It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets Guns are not a part of our lives In many countries it is a different story In many countries people are confronted with guns They are oppressed They are intimidated -- by warlords by terrorists by criminals Weapons can do a lot of harm They are the cause of much distress Why then am I standing before you with this weapon Why did I choose the gun as my instrument Today I want to tell you why Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world And I want to tell you how this gun can help My story starts in the city of Nijmegen in the east of The Netherlands the city where I was born My father was a hardworking baker but when he had finished work in the bakery he often told me and my brother stories And most of the time he told me this story I'm going to share with you now The story of what happened when he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War The Nazis invaded The Netherlands Their grim plans were evident They meant to rule by means of repression Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans Only brute force remained It was our last resort My father was there to provide it As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt my father was an excellent marksman When he aimed he never missed At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country his country our country He fired Nothing happened He fired again No German soldier fell to the ground My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank Hitler's troops marched on and there was nothing my father could do about it Until the day my father died he was frustrated about missing these shots He could have done something But with an old gun not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark So this story stayed with me Then in high school I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn't know They liberated my birth town It was then that I decided I would take up the gun -- out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us -- from the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil And that is why I took up the gun -- not to shoot not to kill not to destroy but to stop those who would do evil to protect the vulnerable to defend democratic values to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place Ladies and gentlemen I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons I do not like guns And once you have been under fire yourself it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world Now this may sound contradictory to you But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon Sarajevo and unclear national as The Netherlands' chief of defense this is also supported by cold hard statistics Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era Why Why has violence decreased Has the human mind changed Well we were talking on the human mind this morning Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge for violent rituals for pure rage Or is there something else In his latest book Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence -- legitimized by a democratically elected government legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system In other words a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control Such a state monopoly on violence first of all serves as a reassurance It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies Secondly the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel It enhances peace even further Where there is no conflict trade flourishes And trade is another important incentive against violence With trade there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties And when there is mutual gain both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war War is simply no longer the best option and that is why violence has decreased This ladies and gentlemen is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us to do so It is this legitimate controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to the statistics of war conflict and violence around the globe It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous Failed states have no legitimized democratically controlled use of force Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan That is why we train police officers we train judges we train public prosecutors around the world And that is why -- and in The Netherlands we are very unique in that -- that is why the Dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law Ladies and gentlemen looking at this gun we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind Every day I hope that politicians diplomats development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression But until that day comes we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle Until that day comes I stand for my father who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun I stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg which was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan Ladies and gentlemen until the day comes when we can do away with the gun I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge It takes hard work often behind the scenes It takes good equipment and well-trained dedicated soldiers I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun instead of the bad gun my father was given I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home and when they are injured and need our care They put their lives on the line for us for you and we cannot let them down I hope you will respect my soldiers this soldier with this gun Because she wants a better world Because she makes an active contribution to the better world just like all of us here today Thank you very much Let's talk about billions Let's talk about past and future billions We know that about 106 billion people have ever lived And we know that most of them are dead And we also know that most of them live or lived in Asia And we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long Let's talk about billions Let's talk about the 195，000 billion dollars of wealth in the world today We know that most of that wealth was made after the year 1800 And we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call Westerners: Europeans North Americans Australasians 19 percent of the world's population today Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth Economic historians call this The Great Divergence And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you It's basically two ratios of per capita GDP per capita gross domestic product so average income One the red line is the ratio of British to Indian per capita income And the blue line is the ratio of American to Chinese And this chart goes back to 1500 And you can see here that there's an exponential Great Divergence They start off pretty close together In fact in 1500 the average Chinese was richer than the average North American When you get to the 1970s which is where this chart ends the average Briton is more than 10 times richer than the average Indian And that's allowing for differences in the cost of living It's based on purchasing power parity The average American is nearly 20 times richer than the average Chinese by the 1970s So why This wasn't just an economic story If you take the 10 countries that went on to become the Western empires in 1500 they were really quite tiny -- five percent of the world's land surface 16 percent of its population maybe 20 percent of its income By 1913 these 10 countries plus the United States controlled vast global empires -- 58 percent of the world's territory about the same percentage of its population and a really huge nearly three-quarters share of global economic output And notice most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles not to their colonial possessions Now you can't just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons One empire was the least original thing that the West did after 1500 Everybody did empire They beat preexisting Oriental empires like the Mughals and the Ottomans So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation for the Great Divergence In any case as you may remember the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s some considerable time after decolonization This is not a new question Samuel Johnson the great lexicographer posed it through his character Rasselas in his novel Rasselas Prince of Abissinia published in 1759 By what means are the Europeans thus powerful; or why since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest cannot the Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts plant colonies in their ports and give laws to their natural princes The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither That's a great question And you know what it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world -- like Ibrahim Muteferrika an Ottoman official the man who introduced printing very belatedly to the Ottoman Empire -- who said in a book published in 1731 Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with Muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies Unlike Rasselas Muteferrika had an answer to that question which was correct He said it was because they have laws and rules invented by reason It's not geography You may think we can explain the Great Divergence in terms of geography We know that's wrong because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions We took all the Germans we divided them roughly in two and we gave the ones in the East communism and you see the result Within an incredibly short period of time people living in the German Democratic Republic produced Trabants the Trabbi one of the world's worst ever cars while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz If you still don't believe me we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with notice the same basic traditional culture and we divided them in two and we gave the Northerners communism And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly but in almost every other respect it's a huge divergence Which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character popular explanations for this kind of thing are really significant It's the ideas It's the institutions This must be true because a Scotsman said it And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED So let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman He was Adam Smith -- not Billy Connolly not Sean Connery -- though he is very smart indeed Smith -- and I want you to go and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile; it's a wonderful statue -- Smith in the Wealth of Nations published in 1776 -- that's the most important thing that happened that year 。。 You bet There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies but 。。 China seems to have been long stationary and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions But this complement may be much inferior to what with other laws and institutions the nature of its soil climate and situation might admit of That is so right and so cool And he said it such a long time ago But you know this is a TED audience and if I keep talking about institutions you're going to turn off So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand Let's call them the killer apps I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the West apart from the rest And they're kind of like the apps on your phone in the sense that they look quite simple They're just icons; you click on them But behind the icon there's complex code It's the same with institutions There are six which I think explain the Great Divergence One competition Two the scientific revolution Three property rights Four modern medicine Five the consumer society And six the work ethic You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at or try and boil it down to just four but you'll lose Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process Competition means not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500 but within each of these units there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns The ancestor of the modern corporation the City of London Corporation existed in the 12th century Nothing like this existed in China where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination which took three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters and very complex Confucian essay writing The scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world in a number of crucial ways the most important being that through the experimental method it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application of Newtonian physics to ballistics Once you do that your artillery becomes accurate Think of what that means That really was a killer application Meanwhile there's no scientific revolution anywhere else The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe but there's no scientific revolution there In fact they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory because it's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of God Property rights: It's not the democracy folks; it's having the rule of law based on private property rights That's what makes the difference between North America and South America You could turn up in North America having signed a deed of indenture saying I'll work for nothing for five years You just have to feed me But at the end of it you've got a hundred acres of land That's the land grant on the bottom half of the slide That's not possible in Latin America where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors And you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between North and South Most people in rural North America owned some land by 1900 Hardly anyone in South America did That's another killer app Modern medicine in the late 19th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people And this was another killer app -- the very opposite of a killer because it doubled and then more than doubled human life expectancy It even did that in the European empires Even in places like Senegal beginning in the early 20th century there were major breakthroughs in public health and life expectancy began to rise It doesn't rise any faster after these countries become independent The empires weren't all bad The consumer society is what you need for the Industrial Revolution to have a point You need people to want to wear tons of clothes You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month; I guarantee it That's the consumer society and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself Japan was the first non-Western society to embrace it The alternative which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent Very few Indians today wish that India had gone down Mahatma Gandhi's road Finally the work ethic Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant He was wrong Any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work We know this because today the work ethic is no longer a Protestant Western phenomenon In fact the West has lost its work ethic Today the average Korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average German -- a thousand And this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon and that is the end of the Great Divergence Who's got the work ethic now Take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds At the top of the international league table according to the latest PISA study is the Shanghai district of China The gap between Shanghai and the United Kingdom and the United States is as big as the gap between the U。K and the U。S and Albania and Tunisia You probably assume that because the iPhone was designed in California but assembled in China that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation You're wrong In terms of patents there's no question that the East is ahead Not only has Japan been ahead for some time South Korea has gone into third place and China is just about to overtake Germany Why Because the killer apps can be downloaded It's open source Any society can adopt these institutions and when they do they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 -- only faster This is the Great Reconvergence and it's the biggest story of your lifetime Because it's on your watch that this is happening It's our generation that is witnessing the end of Western predominance The average American used to be more than 20 times richer than the average Chinese Now it's just five times and soon it will be 2。5 times So I want to end with three questions for the future billions just ahead of 2016 when the United States will lose its place as number one economy to China The first is can you delete these apps and are we in the process of doing so in the Western world The second question is does the sequencing of the download matter And could Africa get that sequencing wrong One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy before you've established secure private property rights Warning: that may not work And third can China do without killer app number three That's the one that John Locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law That's the basis for the Western model of representative government Now this picture shows the demolition of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio in Shanghai earlier this year He's now free again having been detained as you know for some time But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt Winston Churchill once defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938 And I think these words really nail it: It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians It means that violence the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs the conditions of camps and warfare of riot and tyranny give place to parliaments where laws are made and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained That is civilization -- and in its soil grow continually freedom comfort and culture what all TEDsters care about most When civilization reigns in any country a wider and less harassed life is afforded to the masses of the people That's so true I don't think the decline of Western civilization is inevitable because I don't think history operates in this kind of life-cycle model beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's Course of Empire paintings That's not the way history works That's not the way the West rose and I don't think it's the way the West will fall The West may collapse very suddenly Complex civilizations do that because they operate most of the time on the edge of chaos That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations No we may hang on despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo But one thing is for sure the Great Divergence is over folks Thanks very much Niall I am just curious about your take on the other region of the world that's booming which is Latin America What's your view on that Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking about the rise of the East; I'm talking about the rise of the Rest and that includes South America I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard Hey is South America part of the West He was an expert in Latin American history He said I don't know; I'll have to think about that That tells you something really important I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular but also Chile which was in many ways the one that led the way in transforming the institutions of economic life there's a very bright future indeed So my story really is as much about that convergence in the Americas as it's a convergence story in Eurasia And there is this impression that North America and Europe are not really paying attention to these trends Mostly they're worried about each other The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow And that's all we seem to be caring about recently NF: I think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic -- is essentially the same thing taking different forms in terms of political culture And it's a crisis that has its structural facet -- it's partly to do with demographics But it's also of course to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage excessive borrowing in the private sector That crisis which has been the focus of so much attention including by me I think is an epiphenomenon The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon which has just accelerated this huge shift which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy I think that's its real importance Niall thank you I'm not at all a cook So don't fear this is not going to be a cooking demonstration But I do want to talk to you about something that I think is dear to all of us And that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic most fundamental human staple And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets bread is standard Bread is not only standard in the Western diet As I will show to you it is actually the mainstay of modern life So I'm going to bake bread for you In the meantime I'm also talking to you so my life is going to complicated Bear with me First of all a little bit of audience participation I have two loaves of bread here One is a supermarket standard: white bread pre-packaged which I'm told is called a Wonderbread I didn't know this word until I arrived And this is more or less a whole-meal handmade small-bakery loaf of bread Here we go I want to see a show of hands Who prefers the whole-meal bread Okay let me do this differently Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all I have two tentative male hands Okay now the question is really why is this so And I think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity It's about a traditional way of living A way that is perhaps more real more honest This is an image from Tuscany where we feel agriculture is still about beauty And life is really too And this is about good taste good traditions Why do we have this image Why do we feel that this is more true than this Well I think it has a lot to do with our history In the 10，000 years since agriculture evolved most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production And we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image It was a mythical past Of course the reality is quite different These poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals had yield levels that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in West Africa But we have somehow in the course of the last few centuries or even decades started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us It brought us power It brought us mechanization fertilizers And it actually drove up our yields And even sort of horrible things like picking beans by hand can now be done automatically All that is a real great improvement as we shall see Of course we also particularly in the last decade managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets in a chain of global trade And it means that you now eat products which can come from all around the world That is the reality of our modern life Now you may prefer this loaf of bread Excuse my hands but this is how it is But actually the real relevant bread historically is this white Wonder loaf And don't despise the white bread because it really I think symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all And that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much But it has changed the world This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world So what is happening Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics With the advent of the Industrial Revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades since the 1960s food availability per head in this world has increased by 25 percent And the world population in the meantime has doubled That means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history And that is the result directly of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production And this is true as you can see for all countries including the so-called developing countries What happened to our bread in the meantime As food became plentiful here it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people working in agriculture to something like on average in the high income countries five percent or less of the population In the U。S only one percent of the people are actually farmers And it frees us all up to do other things -- to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food That is historically a really unique situation Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact So as food became more plentiful bread became cheaper And as it became cheaper bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things We added in more sugar We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread from a simple food into kind of a support for calories And today bread now is associated with obesity which is very strange It is the basic most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today But this is now this strange concoction of high calories And that's not only true in this country it is true all over the world Bread has migrated to tropical countries where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava So bread has become from a main staple a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity of modern life And the whiter the bread in many countries the better it is So this is the story of bread as we know it now But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large-scale And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes destruction of biodiversity -- still a lonely emu here in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields The costs have been tremendous -- water pollution all the things you know about destruction of our habitats What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about And this is where I have to query all of you How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals How many of you actually can make a bread in this way without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor Can you actually bake bread Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs We have become very removed from what our bread really is which again evolutionarily speaking is very strange In fact not many of you know that our bread of course was not a European invention It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular The tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat This is where it all comes from and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago put us on the road of bread Now it is not surprising that with this massification and large-scale production there is a counter-movement that emerged -- very much also here in California The counter-movement says Let's go back to this Let's go back to traditional farming Let's go back to small-scale to farmers' markets small bakeries and all that Wonderful Don't we all agree I certainly agree I would love to go back to Tuscany to this kind of traditional setting gastronomy good food But this is a fallacy And the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about If we do this if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going actually to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom I have lived for many years working without electricity and water to try to improve their food production -- we relegate them to poverty What they want are implements to increase their production: something to fertilize the soil something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it if you want to afford it In fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this If we say just small-scale production as is the tendency here to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges So local food production is out But also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas And we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation So we must find other solutions One of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly -- doubling by about 2030 The main driver of that is actually meat And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular is what drives the prices of cereals That need for animal protein is going to continue We can discuss alternatives in another talk perhaps one day but this is our driving force So what can we do Can we find a solution to produce more Yes But we need mechanization And I'm making a real plea here I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice 150，000 times just to plant a crop and weed it You cannot ask people to work under these conditions We need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had So what can we do We must feed three billion people in cities We will not do that through small farmers' markets because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal They have low incomes And they benefit from cheap affordable safe and diverse food That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years But yes there are some solutions And let me just do one simple conceptual thing: if I plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale What you see is that we've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture which was sort of small-scale and low-control We've moved towards large-scale and very high control What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network That's where we should move And the ultimate may be but it doesn't apply to cereals that we have entirely closed ecosystems -- the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner So we need to think differently about agriculture science Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers among you here -- has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large-scale about the destruction of the environment That is not necessary We need more science and not less And we need good science So what kind of science can we have Well first of all I think we can do much better on the existing technologies Use biotechnology where useful particularly in pest and disease resistance There are also robots for example who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch We have much cleverer irrigation We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale We need to think that land is multi-functional It has different functions There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential for nature for agriculture purposes And we also need to re-examine livestock Go regional and go to urban food systems I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements I want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas There are all kinds of ways we can do it We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture But we can do a lot more And the main thing that I would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries or as you stay here: ask your government for an integrated food policy Food is as important as energy as security as the environment Everything is linked together So we can do that In fact in a densely populated country like the River Delta where I live in the Netherlands we have combined these functions So this is not science fiction We can combine things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people -- to house for example the chronically sick There is all kinds of things we can do But there is something you must do It's not enough for me to say Let's get more bold science into agriculture You must go back and think about your own food chain Talk to farmers When was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer Talk to people in restaurants Understand where you are in the food chain where your food comes from Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events And that frees you up to do other things And above all to me food is about respect It's about understanding when you eat that there are also many people who are still in this situation who are still struggling for their daily food And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution is really not morally justified We need to help to lift them out of poverty We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive Never before as I said has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap And I think there is nobody else who has expressed better to me the idea that food in the end in our own tradition is something holy It's not about nutrients and calories It's about sharing It's about honesty It's about identity Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi 75 years ago when he spoke about bread He did not speak about rice in India He said To those who have to go without two meals a day God can only appear as bread And so as I'm finishing my bread here -- and I've been baking it and I'll try not to burn my hands Let me share with those of you here in the first row Let me share some of the food with you Take some of my bread And as you eat it and as you try it -- please come and stand up Have some of it I want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future: to these anonymous farmers that first bred the first wheat varieties; and to the farmers of today who've been making this And you don't even know who they are Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world Everything makes us so privileged that we can eat this food that we don't struggle every day And that I think evolutionarily-speaking is unique We've never had that before So enjoy your bread Eat it and feel privileged Thank you very much Across Europe and Central Asia approximately one million children live in large residential institutions usually known as orphanages Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children Others know more about the living conditions there but still think they're a necessary evil After all where else would we put all of those children who don't have any parents But 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development and this is particularly true for young babies As we know babies are born without their full muscle development and that includes the brain During the first three years of life the brain grows to its full size with most of that growth taking place in the first six months The brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation Every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes to mimic a movement or a facial expression to pick something up to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness They communicate their delight to their children who respond with smiles and a desire to achieve more and to learn more This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical social language cognitive and psychomotor development It is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own children It happens so naturally in most families that we don't even notice it Most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and by extension to the development of a healthy society And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children In August 1993 I had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting Those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions I was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families Housing 550 babies this was Ceausescu's show orphanage and so I'd been told the conditions were much better Having worked with lots of young children I expected the institution to be a riot of noise but it was as silent as a convent It was hard to believe there were any children there at all yet the director showed me into room after room each containing row upon row of cots in each of which lay a child staring into space In a room of 40 newborns not one of them was crying Yet I could see soiled nappies and I could see that some of the children were distressed but the only noise was a low continuous moan The head nurse told me proudly You see our children are very well-behaved Over the next few days I began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours but their demands were not met and so eventually they learned not to bother Within a few days they were listless lethargic and staring into space like all the others Over the years many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children but often one member of staff is caring for 10 20 and even 40 children Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30 At 8 their nappies must be changed so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children If a child soils its nappy at 8:30 he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again The child's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling the walls or the bars of their cots Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries from the Czech Republic to Sudan Across all of these diverse lands and cultures the institutions and the child's journey through them is depressingly similar Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping rocking back and forth or aggression and in some institutions psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children whilst in others children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities Most of these children will never leave the institution again For those without disabilities at age three they're transferred to another institution and at age seven to yet another Segregated according to age and gender they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings often without even a chance to say goodbye There's rarely enough to eat They are often hungry The older children bully the little ones They learn to survive They learn to defend themselves or they go under When they leave the institution they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society In Moldova young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions young adults 20 percent of them had a criminal record 14 percent were involved in prostitution and 10 percent had taken their own lives But why are there so many orphans in Europe when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years In fact more than 95 percent of these children have living parents and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children but research shows that most parents want their children and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and ethnicity Many countries have not developed inclusive schools and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school at age six or seven The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home If the family's poor they find it difficult to visit and gradually the relationship breaks down Behind each of the million children in institutions there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they've run out of options like Natalia in Moldova who only had enough money to feed her baby and so had to send her older son to the institution; or Desi in Bulgaria who looked after her four children at home until her husband died but then she had to go out to work full time and with no support felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they're pregnant who leave their babies in a hospital; or the new parents the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child's potential are told by the doctors Forget her leave her in the institution go home and make a healthy one This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable Every child has the right to a family deserves and needs a family and children are amazingly resilient We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on they recover their developmental delays and go on to lead normal happy lives It's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions One study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent If we spend less on these children but on the right services we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs Across Europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential When I first started to work in Romania nearly 20 years ago there were 200，000 children living in institutions and more entering every day Now there are less than 10，000 and family support services are provided across the country In Moldova despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools Many countries have developed national action plans for change The European Commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support empowering communities to look after their own children But there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children Awareness-raising is required at every level of society People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children and the better alternatives that exist If we know people who are planning to support orphanages we should convince them to support family services instead Together this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime Thank you You know we wake up in the morning you get dressed put on your shoes you head out into the world You plan on coming back getting undressed going to bed waking up doing it again and that anticipation that rhythm helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives and gives it a measure of predictability Living in New York City as I do it's almost as if with so many people doing so many things at the same time in such close quarters it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck You're never there's just juxtapositions are possible that just aren't you don't think they're going to happen And you never think you're going to be the guy who's walking down the street and because you choose to go down one side or the other the rest of your life is changed forever And one night I'm riding the uptown local train I get on I tend to be a little bit vigilant when I get on the subway I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones or a book And I get on the car and I look and I notice this couple college-aged student-looking kids a guy and a girl and they're sitting next to each other and she's got her leg draped over his knee and they're doing -- they have this little contraption and they're tying these knots and they're doing it with one hand they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it I've never seen anything like this It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks And at the next stop a guy gets on the car and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him He's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches and he looks at them and then in a blink of an eye he kneels down in front of them and he starts to say You know listen here's how you can do it Look if you do this -- and he takes the laces out of their hand and instantly he starts tying these knots and even better than they were doing it remarkably And it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques and he's the guy giving the lecture So he starts to tell them and he's like No this is very important here You know when you're needing these knots it's going to be you know everything's going to be happening at the same time it's going to be -- you're going to have all this information coming at you there's going to be organs getting in the way it's going to be slippery and it's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature each hand left hand right hand you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers And at that moment when I heard that I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed to the trauma room of St Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan and what had happened was a gang had come in from Brooklyn As part of an initiation for three of their members they had to kill somebody and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street that night and they jumped on me without a word One of the very lucky things when I was at Notre Dame I was on the boxing team so I put my hands up right away instinctively The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade and he went in under my elbow and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava If you know anything about anatomy that's not a good thing to get cut and everything of course on the way up and then I still had my hands up he pulled it out and went for my neck and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck and I got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out The other guy was still working on me collapsing my other lung and I managed to by hitting that guy to get a minute I ran down the street and collapsed and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and let the trauma room know they had an incoming And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision and I was moving my head around and we got to St Vincent's and we're racing down this hallway and I see the lights going and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that They don't really go to the usual place that memories go They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def and George Lucas did all the sound effects So sometimes remembering them it's like it's not like any other kind of memories And I get into the trauma room and they're waiting for me and the lights are there and I'd been able to breathe a little more now because the blood has left had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher And I said Is there anything I can do to help and the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh and I'm turning my head trying to see everybody and I had this weird memory of being in college and raising raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh and then I look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me and I think He looks Bangladeshi and I just have those two facts and I just think This could work somehow And then I go out and they work on me for the rest of the night and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there while they did their work and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines my cecum organs I didn't know that I had and he later told me one of the last things he did while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me which I thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end And I came to in the morning Out of anesthetic he had let them know that he wanted to be there and he had given me about a two percent chance of living So he was there when I woke up and it was waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain It was that enveloping and there was only one spot that didn't hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt and it was my instep and he was holding the arch of my foot and rubbing the instep with his thumb And I looked up and he's like Good to see you and I was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything and the pain was just overwhelming and he said You know we didn't cut your hair I thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson and you're going to need all the strength you can get And in those days my hair was down to my waist I drove a motorcycle I was unmarried I owned a bar so those were different times But I had three days of life support and everybody was expecting due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that I wasn't going to make it so it was three days of everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop and when I finally pooped then that somehow surgically speaking that's like you crossed some good line and um on that day the surgeon came in and whipped the sheet off of me He had three or four friends with him and he does that and they all look and there was no infection and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding and they're like There's no hematomas blah blah look at the color and they're talking amongst themselves and I'm like this restored automobile that he's just going Yeah I did that And it was just it was amazing because these guys are high-fiving him over how good I turned out you know And it's my zipper and I've still got the staples in and everything And later on when I got out and the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time I went back to him and I was sort of asking him you know what am I gonna do And I think kind of as a surgeon he basically said Kid I saved your life Like now you can do whatever you want like you gotta get on with that It's like I gave you a new car and you're complaining about not finding parking Like just go out and you know do your best But you're alive That's what it's about And then I hear Bing-bong and the subway doors are closing and my stop is next and I look at these kids and I go I think to myself I'm going to lift my shirt up and show them and then I think No this is the New York City subway that's going to lead to other things And so I just think they got their lecture to go to I step off I'm standing on the platform and I feel my index finger in the first scar that I ever got from my umbilical cord and then around that is traced the last scar that I got from my surgeon and I think that that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team and their training and their skill and always a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos Thank you Thank you Very lucky to be here Thank you I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute Before I tell that story we should ask ourselves the question: Why does poverty exist I mean there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs We all live in the same planet but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see whether it's contributing or -- contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years And by and large this has failed And you can see this book written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive By and large it did not work So the question is why is that In my mind there is something to learn from the history of Europe I mean even here yesterday I was walking across the street and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago right across the street from here So my point is there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe where citizens were empowered by technologies And they demanded authorities from -- to come down from their high horses And in the end there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies capitalism -- everything else flourished And so you can see the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up But if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last 60 years Aid actually did the opposite It empowered authorities and as a result marginalized citizens The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business Because they were getting it from abroad And in fact if you see oil-rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes -- Nigeria Saudi Arabia all sorts of countries Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way It empowers authorities without activating the citizens -- their hands legs brains what have you And if you agree with that then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people And that is the real network effect If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard so then things would improve And to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the World Bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments Just see the contrast And that is the perspective I have and then I can start my story Of course how would you empower citizens There could be all sorts of technologies And one is cell phones Recently The Economist recognized this but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago and that's what I've been working on So 12 years ago I was trying to be an investment banker in New York We had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks; we could update each other more often But one time it broke down And it reminded me of a day in 1971 There was a war going on in my country And my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area where it was safer And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling And I walked 10 miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man And he wasn't there so I walked all afternoon back So I had another unproductive day So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York I put those two experiences together side by side and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity -- whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village So naturally I -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty And if that's the case then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time And it turns out that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people And all those phones were in the few urban places The vast rural areas where 100 million people lived there were no telephones So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted just like I wasted a day If you just multiply by 100 million people let's say losing one day a month whatever and you see a vast amount of resource wasted And after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we've got equal is their days are the same length: 24 hours So if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that's a huge waste So I started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity And I couldn't find much really but I found this graph produced by the ITU which is the International Telecommunication Union based in Geneva They show an interesting thing That you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country So the United States or the UK would be here outside And so the impact of one new telephone which is on the vertical axis is very little But if you come back to a poorer country where the GNP per capita is let's say 500 dollars or 300 dollars then the impact is huge: 6，000 dollars Or 5，000 dollars The question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh It turns out: 2，000 dollars So if you spend 2，000 dollars and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years and if 5，000 dollars every year -- so that's 50，000 dollars So obviously this was a gadget to have And of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on then it would be even more dramatic And I knew a little economics by then -- it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity But how would you specialize Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer And Chris is a fisherman farmer Both are generalists So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other is if we can connect with each other And if we are neighbors I could just walk over to his house But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area But in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines But in any event it's connectivity that leads to dependability And that leads to specialization That leads to productivity So the question was I started looking at this issue and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones And one of them is the lacking buying power Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy But the point is if it's a production tool why do we have to worry about that I mean in America people buy cars and they put very little money down They get a car and they go to work The work pays them a salary; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time The car pays for itself So if the telephone is a production tool then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power And of course even if that's true then what about initial buying power So then the question is why can't we have some kind of shared access In the United States we have -- everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community So we could do that for telephones And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet: food clothing shelter whatever But again it's very paternalistic You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures See you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing For instance the Internet was booming in the U。S because there were -- there were people who had computers They had modems They had telephone lines so it's very easy to bring in a new idea like the Internet But that's what's lacking in a poor country So for example we didn't have ways to have credit checks few banks to collect bills etc But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank which is a bank for poor people and had 1，100 branches 12，000 employees 2。3 million borrowers And they had these branches I thought I could put cell towers and create a network And anyway to cut the time short -- so I started -- I first went to them and said You know perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient But you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized I mean of course there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be -- and rock the boat So I started focusing What is it that they really do So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank She typically buys a cow The cow gives milk And she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan And this is a business for her but it's milk for everybody else And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank get a phone and have the phone for everybody And it's a business for her So I wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said It's a little crazy but logical If you think it can be done come and make it happen So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh I created a company in America called Gonofone which in Bengali means people's phone And angel investors in America put in money into that I flew around the world After about a million -- I mean I got rejected from lots of places because I was not only trying to go to a poor country I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country After about a million miles and a meaningful -- a substantial loss of hair I eventually put together a consortium and -- which involved the Norwegian telephone company which provided the know-how and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service To make the story short here is the coverage of the country You can see it's pretty much covered Even in Bangladesh there are some empty places But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage Now about that cow model I talked about There are about 115，000 people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods And it's serving 52，000 villages which represent about 80 million people And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day which is like 700 dollars per year And of course it's very beneficial in a lot of ways It increases income improves welfare etc And the result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with 3。5 million subscribers 115，000 of these phones I talked about -- that produces about a third of the traffic in the network And 2004 the net profit after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers And again here are some of the lessons The government needs to provide economically viable services Actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that Governments need to subsidize private companies This is what some people think And actually private companies help governments with taxes Poor people are recipients Poor people are a resource Services cost too much for the poor Their involvement reduces the cost The poor are uneducated and cannot do much They are very eager learners and very capable survivors I've been very surprised Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day Poor countries need aid Businesses -- this one company has raised the -- if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives And as I was trying to show you as far as I'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen the famous inventor in America He has produced some power generators which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas which is running these generators And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each It's just an experiment We don't know how far it will go but it's going on Thank you Well as Chris pointed out I study the human brain the functions and structure of the human brain And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails Here is this mass of jelly three-pound mass of jelly you can hold in the palm of your hand and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space It can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience of neurology and hopefully someday we'll understand how that happens OK so how do you study this mysterious organ I mean you have 100 billion nerve cells little wisps of protoplasm interacting with each other and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities that we call human nature and human consciousness How does this happen Well there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain One approach the one we use mainly is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction in all your mental capacities a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability What you get is a highly selective loss of one function with other functions being preserved intact and this gives you some confidence in asserting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function So you can then map function onto structure and then find out what the circuitry's doing to generate that particular function So that's what we're trying to do So let me give you a few striking examples of this In fact I'm giving you three examples six minutes each during this talk The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome If you look at the first slide there that's the temporal lobes frontal lobes parietal lobes OK -- the lobes that constitute the brain And if you look tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus And that's been called the face area in the brain because when it's damaged you can no longer recognize people's faces You can still recognize them from their voice and say Oh yeah that's Joe but you can't look at their face and know who it is right You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror I mean you know it's you because you wink and it winks and you know it's a mirror but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself OK Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus But there's another rare syndrome so rare in fact that very few physicians have heard about it not even neurologists This is called the Capgras delusion and that is a patient who's otherwise completely normal has had a head injury comes out of coma otherwise completely normal he looks at his mother and says This looks exactly like my mother this woman but she's an impostor She's some other woman pretending to be my mother Now why does this happen Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent in all other respects but when he sees his mother his delusion kicks in and says it's not mother Now the most common interpretation of this which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks is a Freudian view and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women by the way but I'll just talk about guys When you're a little baby a young baby you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud I'm not saying I believe this but this is the standard Freudian view And then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother Thank God or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother And then what happens is there's a blow to your head damaging the cortex allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge flaming to the surface and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother And you say My God if this is my mom how come I'm being sexually turned on She's some other woman She's an impostor It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain This has never made much sense to me this argument It's very ingenious as all Freudian arguments are -- -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle He'll say Doctor this is not Fifi It looks exactly like Fifi but it's some other dog Right Now you try using the Freudian explanation there You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans or some such thing which is quite absurd of course Now what's really going on So to explain this curious disorder we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain Normally visual signals come in into the eyeballs go to the visual areas in the brain There are in fact 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision and after processing all that the message goes to a small structure called the fusiform gyrus where you perceive faces There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces You can call it the face area of the brain right I talked about that earlier Now when that area's damaged you lose the ability to see faces right But from that area the message cascades into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system the emotional core of the brain and that structure called the amygdala gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at Is it prey Is it predator Is it mate Or is it something absolutely trivial like a piece of lint or a piece of chalk or a -- I don't want to point to that but -- or a shoe or something like that OK Which you can completely ignore So if the amygdala is excited and this is something important the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system Your heart starts beating faster You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to create from muscular exertion And that's fortunate because we can put two electrodes on your palm and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating So I can determine when you're looking at something whether you're excited or whether you're aroused or not OK And I'll get to that in a minute So my idea was when this chap looks at an object when he looks at his -- any object for that matter it goes to the visual areas and however and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus and you recognize it as a pea plant or a table or your mother for that matter OK And then the message cascades into the amygdala and then goes down the autonomic nervous system But maybe in this chap that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system the emotional core of the brain is cut by the accident So because the fusiform is intact the chap can still recognize his mother and says Oh yeah this looks like my mother But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers he says But how come if it's my mother I don't experience a warmth Or terror as the case may be Right And therefore he says How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions This can't be my mother It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother How do you test this Well what you do is if you take any one of you here and put you in front of a screen and measure your galvanic skin response and show pictures on the screen I can measure how you sweat when you see an object like a table or an umbrella Of course you don't sweat If I show you a picture of a lion or a tiger or a pinup you start sweating right And believe it or not if I show you a picture of your mother -- I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating You don't even have to be Jewish Now what happens if you show this patient You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response Tables and chairs and lint nothing happens as in normal people but when you show him a picture of his mother the galvanic skin response is flat There's no emotional reaction to his mother because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh he'll cry so on and so forth -- but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do: take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain By the way if this patient then goes and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone and he says Wow mom how are you Where are you There's no delusion through the phone Then she approaches him after an hour he says Who are you You look just like my mother OK The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers and that's not been cut by the accident So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother no problem When he sees her in person he says it's an impostor OK how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain Is it nature genes or is it nurture And we approach this problem by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb And you all know what a phantom limb is When an arm is amputated or a leg is amputated for gangrene or you lose it in war -- for example in the Iraq war it's now a serious problem -- you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg In fact you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body Believe it or not even with internal viscera I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy -- who have a phantom uterus including phantom menstrual cramps at the appropriate time of the month And in fact one student asked me the other day Do they get phantom PMS A subject ripe for scientific enquiry but we haven't pursued that OK now the next question is what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments One of the things we've found was about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom It'll pat his brother on the shoulder it'll answer the phone when it rings it'll wave goodbye These are very compelling vivid sensations The patient's not delusional He knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient But however about half the patients this doesn't happen The phantom limb -- they'll say But doctor the phantom limb is paralyzed It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful If only I could move it maybe the pain will be relieved Now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed It sounds like an oxymoron But when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed was cut by say a motorcycle accident So the patient had an actual arm which is painful in a sling for a few months or a year and then in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm the surgeon amputates the arm and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains right And this is a serious clinical problem Patients become depressed Some of them are driven to suicide OK So how do you treat this syndrome Now why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb When I looked at the case sheet I found that they had an actual arm and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut and the actual arm had been paralyzed and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself Why does this happen When the arm was intact but paralyzed the brain sends commands to the arm the front of the brain saying Move but it's getting visual feedback saying No Move No Move No Move No And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain and we call this learned paralysis OK The brain learns because of this Hebbian associative link that the mere command to move the arm creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm And then when you've amputated the arm this learned paralysis carries over into your body image and into your phantom OK Now how do you help these patients How do you unlearn the learned paralysis so you can relieve him of this excruciating clenching spasm of the phantom arm Well we said what if you now send the command to the phantom but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command right Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain the phantom cramp How do you do that Well virtual reality But that costs millions of dollars So I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars but don't tell my funding agencies OK What you do is you create what I call a mirror box You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient Derek came in He had his arm amputated 10 years ago He had a brachial avulsion so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed lying in a sling for a year and then the arm was amputated He had a phantom arm excruciatingly painful and he couldn't move it It was a paralyzed phantom arm So he came there and I gave him a mirror like that in a box which I call a mirror box right And the patient puts his phantom left arm which is clenched and in spasm on the left side of the mirror and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror and makes the same posture the clenched posture and looks inside the mirror And what does he experience He looks at the phantom being resurrected because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected Now I said now look wiggle your phantom -- your real fingers or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving right That's obvious but the astonishing thing is the patient then says Oh my God my phantom is moving again and the pain the clenching spasm is relieved And remember my first patient who came in -- -- thank you My first patient came in and he looked in the mirror and I said Look at your reflection of your phantom And he started giggling he says I can see my phantom But he's not stupid He knows it's not real He knows it's a mirror reflection but it's a vivid sensory experience Now I said Move your normal hand and phantom He said Oh I can't move my phantom You know that It's painful I said Move your normal hand And he says Oh my God my phantom is moving again I don't believe this And my pain is being relieved OK And then I said Close your eyes He closes his eyes And move your normal hand Oh nothing It's clenched again OK open your eyes Oh my God oh my God it's moving again So he was like a kid in a candy store So I said OK this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb It's a completely useless ability if you think about it But then I started realizing maybe other kinds of paralysis that you see in neurology like stroke focal dystonias -- there may be a learned component to this which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror So I said Look Derek -- well first of all the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said Look Derek take it home and practice with it for a week or two Maybe after a period of practice you can dispense with the mirror unlearn the paralysis and start moving your paralyzed arm and then relieve yourself of pain So he said OK and he took it home I said Look it's after all two dollars Take it home So he took it home and after two weeks he phones me and he said Doctor you're not going to believe this I said What He said It's gone I said What's gone I thought maybe the mirror box was gone He said No no no you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years It's disappeared And I said -- I got worried I said my God I mean I've changed this guy's body image what about human subjects ethics and all of that And I said Derek does this bother you He said No last three days I've not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain no clenching no phantom forearm pain all those pains are gone away But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder and your box doesn't reach So can you change the design and put it on my forehead so I can you know do this and eliminate my phantom fingers He thought I was some kind of magician Now why does this happen It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back On the other hand there's no proprioception muscle signals saying that there is no arm right And your motor command saying there is an arm and because of this conflict the brain says to hell with it there is no phantom there is no arm right It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals And when the arm disappears the bonus is the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there in space So that's the bonus Now this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain and indeed people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers nothing you can do about it But it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors This has also gone through clinical trials helping lots and lots of patients OK let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century He was a cousin of Charles Darwin He pointed out that certain people in the population who are otherwise completely normal had the following peculiarity: every time they see a number it's colored Five is blue seven is yellow eight is chartreuse nine is indigo OK Bear in mind these people are completely normal in other respects Or C sharp -- sometimes tones evoke color C sharp is blue F sharp is green another tone might be yellow right Why does this happen This is called synesthesia Galton called it synesthesia a mingling of the senses In us all the senses are distinct These people muddle up their senses Why does this happen One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing Synesthesia runs in families so Galton said this is a hereditary basis a genetic basis Secondly synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture which is about creativity -- synesthesia is eight times more common among artists poets novelists and other creative people than in the general population Why would that be I'm going to answer that question It's never been answered before OK what is synesthesia What causes it Well there are many theories One theory is they're just crazy Now that's not really a scientific theory so we can forget about it Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads right Now there may be some truth to this because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego OK Now the third theory is that -- well let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia All right So we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain in the fusiform gyrus So we said there's some accidental cross wiring between color and numbers in the brain So every time you see a number you see a corresponding color and that's why you get synesthesia Now remember -- why does this happen Why would there be crossed wires in some people Remember I said it runs in families That gives you the clue And that is there is an abnormal gene a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring In all of us it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else So every brain region is wired to every other region and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain So if there's a gene causing this trimming and if that gene mutates then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas And if it's between number and color you get number-color synesthesia If it's between tone and color you get tone-color synesthesia So far so good Now what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain so everything is cross-connected Well think about what artists novelists and poets have in common the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking linking seemingly unrelated ideas such as It is the east and Juliet is the Sun Well you don't say Juliet is the sun does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire I mean schizophrenics do that but it's a different story right Normal people say she's warm like the sun she's radiant like the sun she's nurturing like the sun Instantly you've found the links Now if you assume that this greater cross wiring and concepts are also in different parts of the brain then it's going to create a greater propensity towards metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with synesthesia And hence the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia among poets artists and novelists OK it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia The last demonstration -- can I take one minute OK I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes but you're in denial about it Here's what I call Martian alphabet Just like your alphabet A is A B is B C is C Different shapes for different phonemes right Here you've got Martian alphabet One of them is Kiki one of them is Buba Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Buba Raise your hands Well it's one or two mutants How many of you think that's Buba that's Kiki Raise your hands Ninety-nine percent of you Now none of you is a Martian How did you do that It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki in your auditory cortex the hair cells being excited -- Kiki mimics the visual inflection sudden inflection of that jagged shape Now this is very important because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern but the brain is able to extract the common denominator It's a primitive form of abstraction and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain because when that's damaged these people lose the ability to engage in Buba Kiki but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor If you ask this guy what -- all that glitters is not gold what does that mean The patient says Well if it's metallic and shiny it doesn't mean it's gold You have to measure its specific gravity OK So they completely miss the metaphorical meaning So this area is about eight times the size in higher -- especially in humans -- as in lower primates Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus because it's the crossroads between hearing vision and touch and it became enormous in humans And something very interesting is going on And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities like abstraction metaphor and creativity All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging and by studying patients and asking the right questions Thank you Sorry about that Well first of all let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact TED Global -- for putting this conference together This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century Think African governments will put together a conference like this You think the A。U will put together a conference like this Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga James Shikwati Andrew and the other TED Fellows I call them the Cheetah Generation The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption They understand what accountability and democracy is They're not going to wait for government to do things for them That's the Cheetah Generation and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs In contrast of course we have the Hippo Generation The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites They are stuck in their intellectual patch Complaining about colonialism and imperialism they wouldn't move one foot If you ask them to reform the economies they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo Now there are a lot of Africans who are very angry angry at the condition of Africa Now we're talking about a continent that is not poor It is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry And in a way Africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one There's another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is that there are so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa They don't understand Now we're not saying don't help Africa Helping Africa is noble But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd It's like the blind leading the clueless There are certain things that we need to recognize Africa's begging-bowl leaks Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa It's taken out of Africa That's what the World Bank says Look at Africa's begging-bowl It leaks horribly There are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks What are the leakages Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year Yes put that aside Capital flight out of Africa 80 billion a year Put that aside Let's take food imports Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food Just add that up all these leakages That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa Now back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself it also exported food Not anymore We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong You know it I know it but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here Let's move on and flip over to the next chapter and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter The next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question Whom do we want to help in Africa There is the people and then there is the government or leaders Now the previous speaker before me Idris Mohammed indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa That characterization in my view is even more charitable I belong to an Internet discussion forum an African Internet discussion forum and I asked them I said Since 1960 we've had exactly 204 African heads of state since 1960 And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself I asked them to name me just 20 Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela of course Kwame Nkrumah Nyerere Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin I let that pass My point is they couldn't go beyond 15 Even if they had been able to name me 20 what does that tell you 20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people And if you look at them the slate of the post-colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads Swiss-bank socialists crocodile liberators vampire elites quack revolutionaries Now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people serves the interests of the people and represents the people There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said that Here in Lesotho we've got two problems: rats and the government What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries In fact what we call our governments are vampire states Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people Government is the problem in Africa A vampire state is the government -- -- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself Where do they get their money By creating wealth No By raking it off the backs of their suffering people That's not wealth creation It's wealth redistribution The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people we must know where the African people are Take any African economy An African economy can be broken up into three sectors There is the modern sector there is the informal sector and the traditional sector The modern sector is the abode of the elites It's the seat of government In many African countries the modern sector is lost It's dysfunctional It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves don't understand That is the source of many of Africa's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector claiming innocent lives Now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector The other sectors the informal and the traditional sectors are where you find the majority of the African people the real people in Africa That's where you find them Now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people you go where the people are But that's not what we did As a matter of fact we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors Now traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself and that's why it must import food All right you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work These two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions First one is the political system Traditionally Africans hate governments They hate tyranny If you look into their traditional systems Africans organize their states in two types The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority These societies are the Ibo the Somali the Kikuyus for example They have no chiefs The other ethnic groups which did have chiefs made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power In Ashanti tradition for example the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders Without the council the chief can't pass any law and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed If not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up a new settlement And even if you look in ancient African empires they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority decentralization of power Now this is what I have described to you This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage Now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa It is a total far cry In the economic system in traditional Africa the means of production is privately owned It's owned by extended families You see in the West the basic economic and social unit is the individual The American will say I am because I am and I can damn well do anything I want anytime The accent is on the I In Africa the Africans say I am because we are The we connotes community -- the extended family system The extended family system pools its resources together They own farms They decide what to do what to produce They don't take any orders from their chiefs They decide what to do And when they produce their crops they sell the surplus on marketplaces When they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them So in a nutshell what we had in traditional Africa was a free-market system There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent Timbuktu was one great big market town Kano Salaga -- they were all there Even if you go to West Africa you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women So it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace The market is not alien to Africa What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets capitalism became a western institution and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism Nonsense And even then what kind of socialism did they practice The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss-bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africa's treasuries for deposit in Switzerland That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries What do we do now Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors the traditional sectors That's where you find the African people And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boat-building that I myself tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in Could you please show that The men are going fishing in these small boats Yes it's an enterprise This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur using his own capital He's getting no assistance from the government and he's building a second bigger boat A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians It also means that he will be able to generate wealth And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy All that you need to do all that the elites need to do is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient Now it is not just this informal sector There is also traditional medicine 80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed Now this is an area -- I mean there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area This is where we need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora especially to invest in this We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana And I know that with the Cheetahs we can take Africa back one village at a time Thank you very much You with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged Oh I realize It's hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all And the darkness inside you Can make you feel so small But I see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow Show me a smile then Don't be unhappy Can't remember when I last saw you laughing If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear You can call me up Because you know I'll be there And I'll see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear You can call me up Because you know I'll be there And I'll see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow So don't be afraid to let them show True colors True colors True colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow I would be willing to bet that I'm the dumbest guy in the room because I couldn't get through school I struggled with school But what I knew at a very early age was that I loved money and I loved business and I loved this entrepreneurial thing and I was raised to be an entrepreneur and what I've been really passionate about ever since -- and I've never spoken about this ever until now -- so this is the first time anyone's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said What are you talking about and I told her -- is that I think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society Kids when we grow up have dreams and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed We get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor My parents got me a tutor in French and I still suck in French Two years ago I was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's entrepreneurial master's program And it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world When I was in grade two I won a city-wide speaking competition but nobody had ever said Hey this kid's a good speaker He can't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized No one said Get him a coach in speaking They said get me a tutor in what I suck at So as kids show these traits -- and we need to start looking for them -- I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers Unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say Hey let's be a lawyer or let's be a doctor and we're missing that opportunity because no one ever says Hey be an entrepreneur Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial we could change everything in the world that is a problem today Every problem that's out there somebody has the idea for And as a young kid nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out I think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old parable: If you give a man a fish you feed him for a day If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts What we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn't do: Don't hit; don't bite; don't swear Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like Luongo Crosby Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs The reason that I avoided an MBA program -- other than the fact that I couldn't get into any because I had a 61 percent average out of high school and then 61 percent average at the only school in Canada that accepted me Carlton -- but our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs They teach them to go work in corporations So who's starting these companies It's these random few people Even in popular literature the only book I've ever found -- and this should be on all of your reading lists -- the only book I've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is Atlas Shrugged Everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and say that we're bad people I look at even my family Both my grandfathers were entrepreneurs My dad was an entrepreneur Both my brother and sister and I all three of us own companies as well And we all decided to start these things because it's really the only place we fit We didn't fit in the normal work We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn and we have all these other traits But kids could be entrepreneurs as well I'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference and everyone that I met over there who's an entrepreneur struggled with school I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed So this thing right here is freaking me out It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now -- other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur Attention deficit disorder bipolar disorder Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease Ted Turner's got it Steve Jobs has it All three of the founders of Netscape had it I could go on and on Kids -- you can see these signs in kids And what we're doing is we're giving them Ritalin and saying Don't be an entrepreneurial type Fit into this other system and try to become a student Sorry entrepreneurs aren't students We fast-track We figure out the game I stole essays I cheated on exams I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for 13 consecutive assignments But as an entrepreneur you don't do accounting you hire accountants So I just figured that out earlier At least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won't I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook -- I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every Canadian university and college studies In managerial accounting I'm chapter eight I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting And I told the author after they did my interview that I cheated in that same course And she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway But kids you can see these signs in them The definition of an entrepreneur is a person who organizes operates and assumes the risk of a business venture That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program It doesn't mean you have to get through school It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut And we've heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature right Is it thing one or thing two What is it Well I don't think it's either I think it can be both I was groomed as an entrepreneur When I was growing up as a young kid I had no choice because I was taught at a very early young age -- when my dad realized I wasn't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school -- that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age He groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people My first little business venture: I was seven years old I was in Winnipeg and I was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords And I was calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers And my mom came into the room and she said Where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners And I said Let's go and look in the basement And we went down to the basement And I opened up this cupboard And there was about a thousand coat hangers that I'd collected Because when I told her I was going out to play with the kids I was going door to door in the neighborhood to collect coat hangers to put in the basement to sell Because I saw her a few weeks before that -- you could get paid They used to pay you two cents per coat hanger So I was just like well there's all kinds of coat hangers And so I'll just go get them And I knew she wouldn't want me to go get them so I just did it anyway And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people This one person offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half I even knew at a seven-year-old age that I could actually get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay that because it multiplied up At seven years old I figured it out I got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers I sold license plate protectors door to door My dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale And at nine years old I walked around in the city of Sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses And I remember this one customer so vividly because I also did some other stuff with these clients I sold newspapers And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license plate protector And he's like Well we don't need one And I said But you've got two cars 。。 -- I'm nine years old I'm like But you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors And he said I know And I said This car here's got one license plate that's all crumpled up And he said Yes that's my wife's car And I said Why don't we just test one on the front of your wife's car and see if it lasts longer So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each If I couldn't sell all four I could at least get one I learned that at a young age I did comic book arbitrage When I was about 10 years old I sold comic books out of our cottage on Georgian Bay And I would go biking up to the end of the beach and buy all the comics from the poor kids And then I would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids But it was obvious to me right Buy low sell high You've got this demand over here that has money Don't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash The rich people do Go get some So that's obvious right It's like a recession So there's a recession There's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the U。S economy Go get some of that And I learned that at a young age I also learned don't reveal your source because I got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics from and he didn't like the fact that he was paying a lot more I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old I didn't really want a paper route but at 10 my dad said That's going to be your next business So not only would he get me one but I had to get two and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which I did and then I realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money So I would collect the tips and get payment So I would go and collect for all the papers He could just deliver them Because then I realized I could make the money By this point I was definitely not going to be an employee My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop He had all these old automotive parts lying around They had this old brass and copper I asked him what he did with it and he said he just throws it out I said But wouldn't somebody pay you for that And he goes Maybe Remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years ago I saw opportunity in this stuff I saw there was money in garbage And I was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle And then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where I got paid And I thought that was kind of cool Strangely enough 30 years later we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK and making money off that too I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs and we made these pin cushions for our moms for Mother's Day And you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins -- when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside And you'd make these chairs And I had these little pillows that I would sew up And you could stuff pins in them Because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion But what I realized was that you had to have options So I actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown And then when I went to the door it wasn't Do you want to buy one It was Which color would you like Like I'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no to me especially if you have two options -- you have the brown one or the clear one So I learned that lesson at a young age I learned that manual labor really sucks Right like cutting lawns is brutal But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing That if I land this client once and every week I get paid by that person that's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person Because you can't sell them more So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age Remember I was being groomed to do this I was not allowed to have jobs I would caddy I would go to the golf course and caddy for people But I realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the 13th hole that had this huge hill And people could never get their bags up it So I would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn't have caddies I would carry their golf bags up to the top and they'd pay me a dollar Meanwhile my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy's bag around and get paid 10 bucks I'm like That's stupid because you have to work for five hours That doesn't make any sense You just figure out a way to make more money faster Every week I would go to the corner store and buy all these pops Then I would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge And they'd give me their orders for the following week And then I'd just deliver pop and I'd just charge twice And I had this captured market You didn't need contracts You just needed to have a supply and demand and this audience who bought into you These women weren't going to go to anybody else because they liked me and I kind of figured it out I went and got golf balls from golf courses But everybody else was looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls I'm like screw that They're all in the pond and nobody's going into the pond So I would go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes You just pick them up with both feet You can't do it on stage You get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you're done you've got a couple hundred of them But the problem is that people all didn't want all the golf balls So I just packaged them I'm like 12 right I packaged them up three ways I had the Pinnacles and DDHs and the really cool ones back then Those sold for two dollars each And then I had all the good ones that didn't look crappy They were 50 cents each And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones And they could use those for practice balls I sold sunglasses when I was in school to all the kids in high school This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time But it paid the bills So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses Then when the school shut me down -- the school actually called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it -- so I went to the gas stations and I sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers That was cool because then I had retail outlets And I think I was 14 Then I paid my entire way through first year university at Carlton by selling wine skins door to door You know that you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum and two bottles of coke in a wineskin So what right Yeah but you know what You stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them Supply demand big opportunity I also branded it so I sold them for five times the normal cost It had our university logo on it You know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don't we get them games if they're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs Why don't you teach them not to waste money I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street and my dad said Go pick it up He said I work too damn hard for my money I'm not going to see you ever waste a penny And I remember that lesson to this day Allowances teach kids the wrong habits Allowances by nature are teaching kids to think about a job An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck That's wrong for me if you want to raise entrepreneurs What I do with my kids now -- I've got two nine and seven -- is I teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for stuff that needs to get done Come to me and tell me what it is Or I'll come to them and say Here's what I need done And then you know what we do We negotiate They go around looking for what it is But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid And then they don't have a regular check but they have more opportunities to find more stuff and they learn the skill of negotiating and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well You breed that kind of stuff Each of my kids has two piggy banks Fifty percent of all the money that they earn or get gifted 50 percent goes in their house account 50 percent goes in their toy account Anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want The 50 percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank They walk up with me Every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stock broker already But I'm teaching them to force that savings habit It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now Shit you've missed 25 years You can teach those habits to young kids when they don't even feel the pain yet Don't read them bedtime stories every night Maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items a red shirt a blue tie a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things My kids do that all the time It teaches them to sell; it teaches them creativity; it teaches them to think on their feet Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it's just stand up in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches Those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing Show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like Show them the grumpy employees When you see grumpy customer service point that out to them Say By the way that guy's a crappy employee And say These ones are good ones If you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like We have all these lessons in front of us but we don't take those opportunities; we teach kids to go get a tutor Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk that's in the house right now all the toys that they've outgrown two years ago and said Why don't we start selling some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji And they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever But teach them how to fix the price guess the price pull up the photos Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money Then the money they get 50 percent goes in their house account 50 percent goes in their toy account My kids love this stuff Some of the entrepreneurial traits that you've got to nurture in kids: attainment tenacity leadership introspection interdependence values All these traits you can find in young kids and you can help nurture them Look for that kind of stuff There's two traits that I want you to also look out for that we don't kind of get out of their system Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it and they built Netscape -- imagine if they were given Ritalin We wouldn't have have that stuff right Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet These skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well Because there's huge opportunities in that I want to close with a quick little video It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor These guys Grasshopper It's about kids It's about entrepreneurship Hopefully this inspires you to take what you've heard from me and do something with it to change the world Kid 。。 And you thought you could do anything You still can Because a lot of what we consider impossible 。。 。。 is easy to overcome Because in case you haven't noticed we live in a place where One individual can make a difference Want proof Just look at the people who built our country; Our parents grandparents our aunts uncles 。。 They were immigrants newcomers ready to make their mark Maybe they came with very little Or perhaps they didn't own anything except for 。。 。。 a single brilliant idea These people were thinkers doers 。。 。。 innovators 。。 。。 until they came up with the name 。。 。。 entrepreneurs They change the way we think about what is possible They have a clear vision of how life can be better for all of us even when times are tough Right now it's hard to see 。。 。。 when our view is cluttered with obstacles But turbulence creates opportunities for success achievement and pushes us 。。 to discover new ways of doing things So what opportunities will you go after and why If you're an entrepreneur you know that risk isn't the reward No The rewards are driving innovation 。。 。。 changing people's lives Creating jobs Fueling growth And making a better world Entrepreneurs are everywhere They run small businesses that support our economy design tools to help you 。。 。。 stay connected with friends family and colleagues around the world And they're finding new ways of helping to solve society's oldest problems Do you know an entrepreneur Entrepreneurs can be anyone 。。 Even 。。 you So seize the opportunity to create the job you always wanted Help heal the economy Make a difference Take your business to new heights But most importantly remember when you were a kid 。。 when everything was within you reach and then say to yourself quietly but with determination: It still is Thank you very much for having me When I was considering a career in the art world I took a course in London and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro who drank too much smoked too much and swore much too much But he was a passionate teacher and I remember one of our earlier classes with him he was projecting images on the wall asking us to think about them and he put up an image of a painting It was a landscape with figures semi-dressed drinking wine There was a nude woman in the lower foreground and on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus and he said What is this And I -- no one else did so I put up my hand and I said It's a Bacchanal by Titian He said It's a what I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong It's a Bacchanal by Titian He said It's a what I said It's a Bacchanal by Titian He said You boneless bookworm It's a fucking orgy As I said he swore too much There was an important lesson for me in that Pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training because he feared that it filled people up with jargon and then they just classified things rather than looking at them and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary and he wanted us to use our eyes and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects What is it How is it made Why was it made How is it used And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian My kind of eureka moment came a few years later when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions I found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and really well into the 18th century and it was pretty apparent why Tapestries were portable You could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive They required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials -- the wools the silks even gold and silver thread So all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda Well I became a tapestry historian In due course I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about And in about 1997 the then-director Philippe de Montebello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 We normally have these very long lead-in times It wasn't straightforward It's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car They have to be wound on huge rollers shipped in oversized freighters Some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience: the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded; the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread; the labeling You know we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs a one-hit image These were big complex things almost like cartoons with multiple narratives We had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects There was a lot of skepticism On the opening night I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying This is going to be a bomb But in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show The exhibition was designed to be an experience and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs So I want you to use your imaginations thinking of these wall-high objects some of them 10 meters wide depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism I remember taking my son's school class He was eight at the time and all the little boys they kind of -- you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist And you can just imagine them But it brought it alive to them I think they suddenly saw that these weren't just old faded tapestries These were images of the world in the past and that it was the same for our audience And for me as a curator I felt proud I felt I'd shifted the needle a little Through this experience that could only be created in a museum I'd opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians artists press the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium A few years later I was invited to be the director of the museum and after I got over that -- Who me The tapestry geek I don't wear a tie -- I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that curated museum experience We live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of just add water expertise but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative what the curator does the interpretation of a complex esoteric subject in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience And that to me today is now the challenge and the fun of my job supporting the vision of my curators whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords early Byzantine artifacts Renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the McQueen show with which we enjoyed so much success last summer That was an interesting case In the late spring early summer of 2010 shortly after McQueen's suicide our curator of costume Andrew Bolton came to see me and said I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen and now is the moment We have to we have to do it fast It wasn't easy McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right and we proceeded to do something at the museum I think we've never done before It wasn't just your standard installation In fact we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors a curiosity box a sunken ship a burned-out interior with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating And in this extraordinary setting the costumes were like actors and actresses or living sculptures It could have been a train wreck It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen and the show was quite transcendant and it became a phenomenon in its own right By the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show but no one really complained I heard over and over again Wow that was worth it It was a such a visceral emotive experience Now I've described two very immersive exhibitions but I also believe that collections individual objects can also have that same power The Met was set up not as a museum of American art but of an encyclopedic museum and today 140 years later that vision is as prescient as ever because of course we live in a world of crisis of challenge and we're exposed to it through the 24/7 newsreels It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations the cultures that we're seeing the current manifestation of Whether it's Libya Egypt Syria it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding I mean our new Islamic galleries are a case in point opened 10 years almost to the week after 9/11 I think for most Americans knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before 9/11 and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event Now in our galleries we show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October I'm often asked Is digital media replacing the museum and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion I mean don't get me wrong I'm a huge advocate of the Web It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time across space whose lives may have been very different to our own but who like us had hopes and dreams frustrations and achievements in their lives And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we're going The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world awe-inspiring like a medieval cathedral From there you can walk in any direction to almost any culture I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and I watch our visitors coming in Some of them are comfortable They feel at home They know what they're looking for Others are very uneasy It's an intimidating place They feel that the institution is elitist I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind where they're prepared to be a little bit lost to explore to see the unfamiliar in the familiar or to try the unknown Because for us it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art capturing them at that moment of discomfort when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone your Blackberry but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry or to bring it back to my tutor Pietro those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine and that nude figure in the left foreground Wow She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality In that moment our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal but if we're doing our job right and you've checked the jargon at the front door trust your instinct You know it's an orgy Thank you My title: Queerer than we can suppose: The strangeness of science Queerer than we can suppose comes from J。B。S Haldane the famous biologist who said Now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of or can be dreamed of in any philosophy Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy This means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious that even Feynman himself was moved to remark If you think you understand quantum theory you don't understand quantum theory It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it David Deutsch who's talking here in The Fabric of Reality embraces the many worlds interpretation of quantum theory because the worst that you can say about it is that it's preposterously wasteful It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel -- mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments And that's Richard Feynman The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example Science as opposed to technology does violence to common sense Every time you drink a glass of water he points out the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell It's just elementary probability theory The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater than the number of glassfuls or bladdersful in the world -- and of course there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders You have just breathed in a nitrogen atom that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon to the left of the tall cycad tree Queerer than we can suppose What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence Are there things about the universe that are in principle ungraspable by any mind however superior The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms as successive generations have come to terms with increasing levels of queerness in the universe We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins -- rather than the Sun moves across the sky -- it's hard for us to realize what a shattering mental revolution that must have been After all it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless the Sun small and mobile But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject Tell me he asked a friend why do people always say it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating His friend replied Well obviously because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth Wittgenstein replied Well what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating Science has taught us against all intuition that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium So it would seem the hardest solidest densest rock is really almost entirely empty space broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count Why then do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable As an evolutionary biologist I'd say this: our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms If we had our brains probably would perceive rocks as full of empty space Rocks feel hard and impenetrable to our hands precisely because objects like rocks and hands cannot penetrate each other It's therefore useful for our brains to construct notions like solidity and impenetrability because such notions help us to navigate our bodies through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate Moving to the other end of the scale our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light If they had our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein I want to give the name Middle World to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with Middle Earth Middle World We are evolved denizens of Middle World and that limits what we are capable of imagining We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move and hits another Middle World object like a rock it knocks itself out May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III commander of military intelligence in 1983 He stared at his wall in Arlington Virginia and decided to do it As frightening as the prospect was he was going into the next office He stood up and moved out from behind his desk What is the atom mostly made of he thought Space He started walking What am I mostly made of Atoms He quickened his pace almost to a jog now What is the wall mostly made of Atoms All I have to do is merge the spaces Then General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office Stubblebine who commanded 16，000 soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool in the military arsenal Who would screw around with an army that could do that That's from an article in Playboy which I was reading the other day I have every reason to think it's true; I was reading Playboy because I myself had an article in it Unaided human intuition schooled in Middle World finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object air friction aside would hit the ground at the same instant And that's because in Middle World air friction is always there If we'd evolved in a vacuum we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously If we were bacteria constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules it would be different but we Middle Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion In the same way our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension A small insect would reverse these priorities Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left Douglas Adams is on the right -- Steve Grand in his book Creation: Life and How to Make It is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself We have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium: the ether But we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World where matter is a useful fiction A whirlpool for Steve Grand is a thing with just as much reality as a rock In a desert plain in Tanzania in the shadow of the volcano Ol Donyo Lengai there's a dune made of volcanic ash The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily It's what's technically known as a barchan and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope on the other side and then as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge it cascades down on the inside of the crescent and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves Steve Grand points out that you and I are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing He invites us the reader to think of an experience from your childhood -- something you remember clearly something you can see feel maybe even smell as if you were really there After all you really were there at the time weren't you How else would you remember it But here is the bombshell: You weren't there Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you Whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff of which you are made If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck read it again until it does because it is important So really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence If a neutrino had a brain which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors which couldn't walk through rocks Really for an animal is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to assist its survival and because different species live in different worlds there will be a discomforting variety of reallys What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world but a model of the world regulated and adjusted by sense data but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are A flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking climbing or swimming animal A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized for underground use A water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all since it lives on the surface of the pond in an Edwin Abbott flatland I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird a day-flying bird like a swallow needs to perform the same kind of tasks The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental Bats I've even suggested use perceived hues such as red and blue as labels internal labels for some useful aspect of echoes -- perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces furry or smooth and so on in the same way as swallows or indeed we use those perceived hues -- redness and blueness etc -- to label long and short wavelengths of light There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength And the point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used rather than by the sensory modality involved J B 。S Haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids extremely diluted: caprylic acid and caproic acid The only difference you see is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes Now there's another fatty acid capric acid which is just like the other two except that it has two more carbon atoms A dog that had never met capric acid would perhaps have no more trouble imagining its smell than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet say playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats Middle World -- the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with -- is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors We're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us Middle World is the narrow range of reality which we judge to be normal as opposed to the queerness of the very small the very large and the very fast We could make a similar scale of improbabilities; nothing is totally impossible Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway Because there are so many of them and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement the marble as we see it in Middle World stays rock steady But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time and again and again In this case the hand would move and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World The odds against it of course are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe you still would not have written enough zeros to this day Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us to handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time that which seems impossible in Middle World might turn out to be inevitable One way to think about that is by counting planets We don't know how many planets there are in the universe but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20 or 100 billion billion And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability Could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at If life has arisen only once on any -- if -- if life could -- I mean life could originate once per planet could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe in which case it would have to be here And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince and similar magical things like that If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe that planet has to be our planet because here we are talking about it And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe And when I say quite common it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another which is a sad thought How shall we interpret queerer than we can suppose Queerer than can in principle be supposed or just queerer than we can suppose given the limitations of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World Could we by training and practice emancipate ourselves from Middle World and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding of the very small and the very large I genuinely don't know the answer I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand say quantum theory if we brought up children to play computer games beginning in early childhood which had a sort of make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer's make-believe so that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream And similarly a relativistic computer game in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorenz Contraction and so on to try to get ourselves into the way of thinking -- get children into the way of thinking about it I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World to our perceptions of each other Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind: we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are; our hormones are the way they are We'd be different our characters would be different if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different But we scientists are inconsistent If we were consistent our response to a misbehaving person like a child-murderer should be something like this unit has a faulty component; it needs repairing That's not what we say What we say -- and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us which is probably me -- what we say is Vile monster prison is too good for you Or worse we seek revenge in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge which we see of course all over the world today In short when we're thinking like academics we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars but when we revert to being human we behave more like Basil Fawlty who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland we live in a social world We swim through a sea of people -- a social version of Middle World We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant intuitive psychologists Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains desires and intentions guilt blame-worthiness Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole If the universe is queerer than we can suppose is it just because we've been naturally selected to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves to break out of the box of our evolution Or finally are there some things in the universe so queer that no philosophy of beings however godlike could dream them Thank you very much In December of 2010 the city of Apatzingán in the coastal state of Michoacán in Mexico awoke to gunfire For two straight days the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group presumably from the local criminal organization La Familia Michoacana or the Michoacán family The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city so truly like a battlefield After these two days and during a particularly intense encounter it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana Nazario Moreno was killed In response to this terrifying violence the mayor of Apatzingán decided to call the citizens to a march for peace The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state And so the day of the scheduled procession thousands of people showed up As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march his team noticed that while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white and bearing banners asking for peace the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader Shocked the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime And so his team stepped aside The two marches joined together and they continued their path towards the state capital This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by say just researching online the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100，000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence To put these numbers in perspective this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war which is an active civil war This is happening just south of the border Now as you're reading however you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless nameless dead people Implicitly or explicitly there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner or most likely both And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved They were part of the bad guys And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people However while it's easier to think of us the citizens the police the army as the good guys and them the narcos the carteles as the bad guys if you think about it the latter are only providing a service to the former Whether we like it or not the U。S is the largest market for illegal substances in the world accounting for more than half of global demand It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South and so as the former dictator of Mexico Porfirio Diaz used to say Poor Mexico so far from God and so close to the United States The U。N estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States Using very very conservative assumptions this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part which we know is false that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars To put these numbers in perspective Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars And it so happens that this is a product that because of its nature a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed And the only way to do this because it's illegal is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs Hence the violence If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business It's not only a multi-billion dollar market but it's also a complex one For example the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized international production that by the way needs to have good quality control because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed I urge you but only a little bit because I don't want to get you in trouble to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want wherever you want it whenever you want it anywhere in the U。S。 and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less Think about this for a second Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless ignorant goons that are just shooting each other very difficult to reconcile Now as a business professor and as any business professor would tell you an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure good incentives a solid identity and good brand management This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico Because you would quickly realize and maybe be confused by the fact that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles You will hear about Los Zetas the Knights Templar which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning and the Sinaloa Federation You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press and this is somewhat true or mostly true But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy You see Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals but was actually created by another criminal organization the Gulf Cartel that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico When that corridor became contested they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel so much so that at some point they decided to just take over the operations which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets because they grow up Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine but what they did have and this is again based on their military origin was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many many markets very effectively which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime That includes kidnapping prostitution local drug dealing and human trafficking including of migrants that go from the south to the U。S So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business They focus most of their recruiting on the army and they very openly advertise for better salaries better benefits better promotion paths not to mention much better food than what the army can deliver The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality they let people know that they are there and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand If they agree -- and you don't want to know what happens if they don't -- they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town in exchange for royalties This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature especially when they arrive first in a city but again that's just a brand strategy I'm not saying they're not violent but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all when you count when you do the body count they're actually all the same In contrast to them the Knights Templar that arose in Michoacán emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán Michoacán is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico which then gives you direct access to the U。S The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán against organized crime Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement so they invest heavily in providing local services like dealing with home violence going after petty criminals treating addicts and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are and of course protecting people from other criminal organizations Now they kill a lot of people too but when they kill them they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them through newspaper insertions YouTube videos and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us as an organization of course but to you as citizens And so we're actually here to protect you They as social enterprises do have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around and they have very strict recruiting practices And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade but the way they do it is because they control all of Michoacán and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas they leverage that to for example trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U。S Finally the Sinaloa Federation When you read about them you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations and many people argue the world They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U。S and the Mexican borders but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet They have cultivated a brand of professionalism business acumen and innovation They have designed new drug products and new drug processes They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border and you can see that these are not The Shawshank Redemption types They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar They have invented drones to transport drugs catapults you name it One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list #701 Joaquin Guzman Loera Like any multinational would they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business which is high-margin drugs like cocaine heroine methamphetamines Like any traditional Latin American multinational would the way they control their operations is through family ties When they're entering a new market they send a family member to supervise it or if they're partnering with a new organization they create a family tie either through marriages or other types of ties Like any other multinational would they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model like for example when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this To further strengthen their brand they actually have professional P。R firms that shape how the press talks about them They have professional videographers on staff They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border And so differences aside what these three organizations share is on the one hand a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated coherent organizations that are business organizations and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of them a set of bad guys separated from us we are actually accomplices to them either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption These organizations service recruit from and operate within our communities so necessarily they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn blissful voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young Thank you I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior Not yours of course -- other people's So after being at MIT for a few years I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting You know I don't know how many of those you read but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write So I decided to try and write something more fun And I came up with an idea that I will write a cookbook And the title for my cookbook was going to be Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen And I was quite excited about this I was going to talk a little bit about research a little bit about the kitchen You know we do so much in the kitchen I thought this would be interesting And I wrote a couple of chapters And I took it to MIT press and they said Cute but not for us Go and find somebody else I tried other people and everybody said the same thing Cute Not for us Until somebody said Look if you're serious about this you first have to write a book about your research You have to publish something and then you'll get the opportunity to write something else If you really want to do it you have to do it So I said You know I really don't want to write about my research I do this all day long I want to write something else Something a bit more free less constrained And this person was very forceful and said Look That's the only way you'll ever do it So I said Okay if I have to do it -- I had a sabbatical I said I'll write about my research if there is no other way And then I'll get to do my cookbook So I wrote a book on my research And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways First of all I enjoyed writing But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people It's a fantastic time to write because there is so much feedback you can get from people People write me about their personal experience and about their examples and what they disagree and nuances And even being here -- I mean the last few days I've known really heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about Which I think is just fascinating I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior And I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality So think about these two tables And you must have seen this illusion If I asked you what's longer the vertical line on the table on the left or the horizontal line on the table on the right Which one seems longer Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer No right It's impossible But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes So I can put some lines on; it doesn't help I can animate the lines And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines which I didn't I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you Now the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute You can't look at this and say Okay now I see reality as it is Right It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable predictable consistent way And there is almost nothing we can do about it aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it Here is another one -- this is one of my favorite illusions What do you see the color that top arrow is pointing to Brown Thank you The bottom one Yellow Turns out they're identical Can anybody see them as identical Very very hard I can cover the rest of the cube up And if I cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical And if you don't believe me you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical But again it's the same story that if we take the background away the illusion comes back Right There is no way for us not to see this illusion I guess maybe if you're colorblind I don't think you can see that I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor Vision is one of the best things we do We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision -- bigger than dedicated to anything else We do more vision more hours of the day than we do anything else And we are evolutionarily designed to do vision And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision which we're so good at what's the chance that we don't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at -- for example financial decision making: something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do we don't have a specialized part of the brain and we don't do that many hours of the day And the argument is in those cases it might be the issue that we actually make many more mistakes and worse not have an easy way to see them Because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes; in cognitive illusion it's much much harder to demonstrate to people the mistakes So I want to show you some cognitive illusions or decision-making illusions in the same way And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein And it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to donation And these are different countries in Europe And you basically see two types of countries: countries on the right that seem to be giving a lot; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little or much less The question is why Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little When you ask people this question they usually think that it has to be something about culture Right How much do you care about people Giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society how linked you are Or maybe it is about religion But if you look at this plot you can see that countries that we think about as very similar actually exhibit very different behavior For example Sweden is all the way on the right and Denmark that we think is culturally very similar is all the way on the left Germany is on the left And Austria is on the right The Netherlands is on the left And Belgium is on the right And finally depending on your particular version of European similarity you can think about the U。K and France as either similar culturally or not But it turns out that from organ donation they are very different By the way the Netherlands is an interesting story You see the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group Turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program You know the expression Begging only gets you so far It's 28 percent in organ donation But whatever the countries on the right are doing they are doing a much better job than begging So what are they doing Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV And here is the story The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program And what happens People don't check and they don't join The countries on the right the ones that give a lot have a slightly different form It says check the box below if you don't want to participate Interestingly enough when people get this they again don't check -- but now they join Now think about what this means We wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions We wake up in the morning and we open the closet and we feel that we decide what to wear And we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat What this is actually saying is that much of these decisions are not residing within us They are residing in the person who is designing that form When you walk into the DMV the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing Now it's also very hard to intuit these results Think about it for yourself How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow and you went to the DMV and you would encounter one of these forms that it would actually change your own behavior Very very hard to think that you will influence us We can say Oh these funny Europeans of course it would influence them But when it comes to us we have such a feeling that we are at the driver's seat we have such a feeling that we are in control and we are making the decision that it's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision rather than an actual decision Now you might say These are decisions we don't care about In fact by definition these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die How could we care about something less than something that happens after we die So a standard economist someone who believes in rationality would say You know what The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a V is higher than the possible benefit of the decision so that's why we get this effect But in fact it's not because it's easy It's not because it's trivial It's not because we don't care It's the opposite It's because we care It's difficult and it's complex And it's so complex that we don't know what to do And because we have no idea what to do we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us I'll give you one more example for this This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Schaefer And they said Well this effect also happens to experts people who are well-paid experts in their decisions do it a lot And they basically took a group of physicians And they presented to them a case study of a patient Here is a patient He is a 67-year-old farmer He's been suffering from a right hip pain for a while And then they said to the physician You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient All these medications nothing seems to be working So you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy Hip replacement Okay So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced And then they said to half the physicians they said Yesterday you reviewed the patient's case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication You did not try ibuprofen What do you do Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen Or do you let them go and have hip replacement Well the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try the ibuprofen Very good for the physicians The other group of the physicians they said Yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet ibuprofen and piroxicam And they said You have two medications you didn't try out yet What do you do You let them go Or you pull them back And if you pull them back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam Which one Now think of it This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement But pulling them back all of the sudden becomes more complex There is one more decision What happens now Majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go to hip replacement I hope this worries you by the way -- when you go to see your physician The thing is is that no physician would ever say Piroxicam ibuprofen hip replacement Let's go for hip replacement But the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making Imagine I give you a choice Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome All expenses paid: hotel transportation food breakfast a continental breakfast everything Or a weekend in Paris Now a weekend in Paris a weekend in Rome these are different things; they have different food different culture different art Now imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted Imagine I said A weekend in Rome a weekend in Paris or having your car stolen It's a funny idea because why would having your car stolen in this set influence anything But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this What if it was a trip to Rome all expenses paid transportation breakfast but doesn't include coffee in the morning If you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself It's two euros 50 Now in some ways given that you can have Rome with coffee why would you possibly want Rome without coffee It's like having your car stolen It's an inferior option But guess what happened The moment you add Rome without coffee Rome with coffee becomes more popular And people choose it The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior and not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris Here are two examples of this principle This was an ad from The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices An online subscription for 59 dollars A print subscription for 125 Or you could get both for 125 Now I looked at this and I called up The Economist And I tried to figure out what were they thinking And they passed me from one person to another to another until eventually I got to a person who was in charge of the website And I called them up And they went to check what was going on The next thing I know the ad is gone And no explanation So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students I said What would you choose These are the market share Most people wanted the combo deal Thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option That means our students can read But now if you have an option that nobody wants you can take it off Right So I printed another version of this where I eliminated the middle option I gave it to another 100 students Here is what happens Now the most popular option became the least popular And the least popular became the most popular What was happening was the option that was useless in the middle was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted In fact relative to the option in the middle which was get only the print for 125 the print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal And as a consequence people chose it The general idea here by the way is that we actually don't know our preferences that well And because we don't know our preferences that well we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces: the defaults the particular options that are presented to us and so on One more example of this People believe that when we deal with physical attraction we see somebody and we know immediately whether we like them or not attracted or not Which is why we have these four-minute dates So I decided to do this experiment with people I'll show you graphic images of people -- not real people The experiment was with people I showed some people a picture of Tom and a picture of Jerry I said Who do you want to date Tom or Jerry But for half the people I added an ugly version of Jerry I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive The other people I added an ugly version of Tom And the question was will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective more attractive brothers The answer was absolutely yes When ugly Jerry was around Jerry was popular When ugly Tom was around Tom was popular This of course has two very clear implications for life in general If you ever go bar hopping who do you want to take with you You want a slightly uglier version of yourself Similar Similar 。。 but slightly uglier The second point or course is that if somebody else invites you you know how they think about you Now you're getting it What is the general point The general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view of human nature What a piece of work is man How noble in reason We have this view of ourselves of others The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people In fact in medical terms that's our view But there is a silver lining The silver lining is I think kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting Are we Superman Or are we Homer Simpson When it comes to building the physical world we kind of understand our limitations We build steps And we build these things that not everybody can use obviously We understand our limitations and we build around it But for some reason when it comes to the mental world when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stockmarkets we somehow forget the idea that we are limited I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way that we understand our physical limitations even though they don't stare us in the face in the same way we could design a better world And that I think is the hope of this thing Thank you very much I started juggling a long time ago but long before that I was a golfer and that's what I was a golfer And as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that I sort of lived my whole life is process And it's the process of learning things One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty And he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things Well I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about And that was the mythology of skill So one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought or not But I'm going to explore skill and juggling and basically visual music I guess OK you can start the music thanks Thanks Thank you Now juggling can be a lot of fun; play with skill and play with space play with rhythm And you can turn the mike on now I'm going to do a couple of pieces I do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet Thanks Now this next section was an attempt to explore space You see I think Richard said something about people that are against something Well a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff Well I kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it's a process of joining with forces And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique So juggling gravity -- up down If you figure out what up and down really are it's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything but then you add in sideways Now I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because you're not looking at your hands you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm with the obvious reference to the feet but it's also time -- where the feet were where the balls were Thanks So visual music: rhythm and complexity I'm going to build towards complexity now Juggling three balls is simple and normal Excuse me We're jugglers OK And remember you're transposing you're getting into a subculture here And juggling -- the balls cross and all that OK if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights but then hopefully even rhythm And you can change the rhythm -- good Michael You can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights OK Change the rhythm so it's even Or you can go back and change the height Now skill But you're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way So you've got to go after the space down there OK then you've got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you And then you get crazy Now I'm actually going to ask you to try something so you've got to pay attention Complexity: if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash Things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn You may not be able to affect it it almost drifts on you It goes But that's the closest approximation I can have to it So complexity Now how many here are jugglers OK so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this OK And whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely right No it looks like a mess It looks like a mess with a guy there who's got his hands around that mess OK Well that's what juggling is about right It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand All right So that's one way of doing it which is five balls down OK Another way is the outside And you could play with the rhythm Same pattern Make it faster and smaller Make it wider Make it narrower Bring it back up OK It's done Thanks Now what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright very tactile I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are but let's try something OK so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is I'm going to give you a little clue Enough of a clue So you get the pattern right OK You're not getting off that easy All right Now do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow Green Yellow Pink White OK you can do that Yeah OK Now let's actually learn something Actually let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure You want to do it Yeah OK Hands out in front of you Palms up together What you're going to learn is this OK So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it Index finger middle finger ring little Little ring middle index And then open Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger A little bit faster Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger All right A lot of different learning processes going on in here One learning process that I see is this -- OK Another learning process that I see is this -- OK So everybody take a deep breath in breath out OK Now one more time and -- finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Open Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger OK Shake your hands out Now I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer OK So what you're doing is you're going la la la and you're getting this OK So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way You're going to combine it So what I want you to do is -- fingers I'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing But I want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow OK Here we go So we're going to start off looking at the white ball -- and I'm going to tell you which color and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers OK So white ball and -- finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Pink Finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger Green Finger finger finger finger Yellow Finger finger finger pink or finger Pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger All right How did you do Well OK The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives a moment of learning a moment of challenge It's a moment that you can't make sense of Why the hell should I learn this OK Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life You know I can't decipher -- is it fun Is it challenging Am I supposed to cheat You know what are you supposed to do You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life OK Trying to figure that stuff out But is it going to get you anywhere It's just a moment That's all it is a moment OK I'm going to change the script for one second Just let me do this I don't need music for it Talking about time in a moment There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that a moment And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects What I've done for you here I developed a lot of those tricks and I put the choreography together but they're not original techniques Now I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed OK So a moment how would you define a moment Well as a juggler what I wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment Ahhh All right I'm going to get on my knees and do it So a moment OK And then what I did as a juggler was say OK what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else another dynamic So a moment Another moment Excuse me still getting there A moment that travels A moment -- no we'll try that again It separates and comes back together Time How can you look at time And what do you dedicate it to in exploring a particular thing Well obviously there's something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is There's a mystery There's a mystery in the moment And it has to settle And then it's dependent on something else And then it comes to rest Just a little thing about time Now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this But I just thought I'd talk about a moment All right OK Can we show the video of the triangle Are we ready to do that Yes This is the piece that I told you about It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle Thanks The only thing I'll say about the last session is you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour The only other thing is it was a real shock I always drove motorcycles And when I bought my first car it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house Interesting Anyway balance: constant movement to find an approach to stillness Cheating Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body To have a conversation with it To speak To listen Hup Now it's dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance When it falls going underneath So there's a rhythm to it The rhythm can get much smaller As your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces those tinier movements Thanks Now I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also -- oh actually if you're bored not here here's one use for it You can go with the Sticks One music Thanks That has a certain kind of balance to it which is all about plumb I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level And they influenced that and this next piece which I'll do a little segment of Two Sticks you can go with it Thanks Which is again exploring space or the lines in space Working with space and the lines in space in a different way Oh let's see here So I'll come back to that in a second But working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it This is a little thing that I made because I really like the idea of curves and balls together And then creating space and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms Just a little toy Which leads me to the next thing which is -- what have I got here OK All right I'm actually leading up to something the newest thing that I'm working on This is not it This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape Now what I just did was I worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference Sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that I look at a shape and say what about if I use this and this and this Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5，000 years ago which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs I love ceramics and all of that It's a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness So if you want to go with the music for cylinders Talking about geometry and everything if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run S-Curve music I'm going to do just a short version of it Circles split in half and rotated and mythology Anyway that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and I dance around a small stage so -- two minutes just to end The latest piece that I'm working on -- what I love is that I never know what I'm working on why I'm working on it They're not ideas they're instincts And the latest thing that I'm working on -- -- is something really -- I don't know what it is yet And that's good I like not to know for as long as possible Well because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth And what it is is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves And what it involves and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not but I'll do a little bit of it It initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space And then it started changing and become folding on themselves And then changing levels Because my attempt is to make visual instruments not to just make -- I'll try one other thing For work in three dimensions with your perceptions of space and time Now I don't know exactly where it's going but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing And it's going to change as I go through it But I really like it it feels right This may not be the right shape and -- look at this shape and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it just to see just to play because I love all different kinds of things to play with Let's see here To work with the positive and negative in a different way And to change and to change So I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space We'll see what I come up with Thanks for having me Our face is hugely important because it's the external visual part that everybody else sees Let's not forget it's a functional entity We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain It's where our senses are located our special senses -- our vision our speech our hearing our smell our taste And this bone is peppered as you can see with the light shining through the skull with cavities the sinuses which warm and moisten the air we breathe But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight we wouldn't be able to hold it erect we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression our universal language of expression our social-signaling system And overlying this is the skin drape which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure -- taking right-angled bends here and there having thin areas like the eyelids thick areas like the cheek different colors And then we have the sensual factor of the face Where do we like to kiss people On the lips Nibble the ears maybe It's the face where we're attracted to with that But let's not forget the hair You're looking at the image on your left-hand side -- that's my son with his eyebrows present Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing There's a definite difference And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose he'd look even odder still Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance They don't need this They need psychiatric help Max has kindly donated his photograph to me He doesn't have dysmorphophobia but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic In other words he looks entirely normal Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes So children judge themselves learn to judge themselves by the behavior of adults around them Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull has obliterated her nose and she's having difficulty seeing As you can see it's blocking her vision She's also in danger when she damages this of bleeding profusely Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them They've grown used to their face; they think they're special Actually sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them But other adults say incredibly painful things They say How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people Shouldn't you be doing something about this Why haven't you had it removed And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion because -- a natural curiosity And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature After surgery everything normalizes The adults behave more naturally and the children play more readily with other children As teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance We're trying to struggle to find our identity We crave the approval of our peers So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day practicing your sardonic look practicing your serious look trying to look like Sean Connery as I did trying to raise one eyebrow It's a crippling time I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward Turn to the person next to you push your lower jaws forward Turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable That's exactly what people used to say to Sue She wasn't miserable at all But people used to say to her Why are you so miserable People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school So she chose to have facial surgery After the facial surgery she said My face now reflects my personality People know now that I'm enthusiastic that I'm a happy person And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers Is this change though a real change or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery And what we found was -- we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after -- what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery Well that's not surprising but we also asked them to judge them on honesty intelligence friendliness violence They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent etc -- before the surgery After the surgery they were perceived as being more intelligent more friendly more honest less violent -- and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character When people get older they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma So this is a photograph of Henry two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone his upper jaw his eye-socket He looks pretty good at this stage But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly I learned a huge amount from Henry Henry taught me that you can carry on working He worked as an advocate He continued to play cricket He enjoyed life to the full and this was probably because he had a successful fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially He maintained a calm insouciance I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it This was something more than that He ignored it He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it And that's what these people can do Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well This is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on It was my longest operation It took 23 hours I did it with my neurosurgeon We removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye his nose the skull bones the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse He got married He had a son called Jeremiah And again he said This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family; he had a successful fulfilling job So we've seen that we can change people's faces But when we change people's faces are we changing their identity -- for better or for worse For instance there are two different types of facial surgery We can categorize it like that We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery -- like Sue When they have facial surgery they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people They don't feel different They feel that they've actually gained what they never had that their face now reflects their personality And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery Because you might say Well this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic If you do cosmetic surgery patients are often less happy They're trying to achieve difference in their lives Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery They're people who have their face shot off I'll move it off and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you They have it forced upon them And again as I told you if they have a caring family and good work life then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives Their identity doesn't change Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon Muzetta's family give the lie to this This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly After she had surgery to remove the tumor her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress a pink ribbon in her hair and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa So it's not simply a Western phenomenon We make judgments on people's faces all the time It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces He said you could see criminal faces judging them just on the photographs that were showed Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly We look at O。J -- he's a good-looking guy We'd like to spend time with him He looks friendly Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer and actually he's not the good guy And beauty doesn't equate to goodness and certainly doesn't equate to contentment So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face but actually we're more comfortable with judging the moving face We think we can judge people on their expressions U。K jurors in the U。K justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity -- the blink the hesitation And so they want to see live witnesses Todorov tells us that in a tenth of a second we can make a judgment on somebody's face Are we uncomfortable with this image Yes we are Would we be happy if our doctor's face our lawyer's face our financial adviser's face was covered We'd be pretty uncomfortable But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement The truth is that there's a five-minute rule not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov but a five-minute rule If you spend five minutes with somebody you start looking beyond their facial appearance and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them and the people who you didn't immediately seek out because you didn't find them particularly attractive become attractive people because of their personality So we've talked a lot about facial appearance I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we're at and where we're going This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed And you can see in the images afterward we've managed to reconstruct her successfully But that's not good enough This is what Ann wants She wants to be out kayaking she wants to be out climbing mountains And that's what she achieved and that's what we have to get to This is a horrific image so I'm putting my hand up now This is a photograph of Adi a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery And he lost his lower jaw his lip his chin and his upper jaw and teeth This is the bar that he set for us I want to look like this This is how I looked before So with modern technology we used computers to make models We made a model of the jaw without bone in it We then bent a plate up to it We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position We then put bone and tissue from the back Here you can see the plate holding it and you can see the implants being put in -- so that in one operation we achieve this and this So the patient's life is restored That's the good news However his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before It's skin from his back It's thicker it's darker it's coarser it doesn't have the contours And that's where we're failing and that's where we need the face transplant The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin We can replace the underlying skeletal structure but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives What does that mean They have an increased risk of infection an increased risk of malignancy This is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart or liver or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant and as a result are the patients going to say if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer We don't know yet We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin who did the first operation are studying that Donors are going to be short on the ground because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death So there are going to be problems with face transplantation So the better news is the future's almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering Just imagine I can make a biologically-degradable template I can put it in place where it's meant to be I can sprinkle a few cells stem cells from the patient's own hip a little bit of genetically engineered protein and lo and behold leave it for four months and the face is grown This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe But we've still got problems We've got mouth cancer to solve We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer We're still not reconstructing them well enough In the U。K we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people We still can't get rid of scars We need to do research And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future so we don't just sit on our laurels and say Okay we're doing okay Let's leave it as it is Thank you very much indeed Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data to put your data on the web on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data scientific data community data whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things in ways that they never could have imagined So today I'm back just to show you a few things to show you in fact there is an open data movement afoot now around the world The cry of Raw data now which I made people make in the auditorium was heard around the world So let's roll the video A classic story the first one which lots of people picked up was when in March -- on March 10th in fact soon after TED -- Paul Clarke in the U。K government blogged Oh I've just got some raw data Here it is it's about bicycle accidents Two days it took the Times Online to make a map a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected Here's more data traffic survey data again put out by the U。K government and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards then a user could just make a map just by clicking Does this data affect things Well let's get back to 2008 Look at Zanesville Ohio Here's a map a lawyer made He put on it the water plant and which houses are there which houses have been connected to the water And he got from other data sources information to show which houses are occupied by white people Well there was too much of a correlation he felt between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water and the judge was not impressed either The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10。9 million dollars That's the power of taking one piece of data another piece of data putting it together and showing the result Let's look at some data from the U。K now This is U。K government data a completely independent site Where Does My Money Go It allows anybody to go there and burrow down You can burrow down by a particular type of spending or you can go through all the different regions and compare them So that's happening in the U。K with U。K government data Yes certainly you can do it over here Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California Take an arbitrary example Long Beach California you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy In fact this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data。gov and data。gov。uk And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U。K in blue and the U。S in red How can you use this stuff Well for example if you have lots of data about places you can take from a postcode -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses you can make paper print off a paper which has got very very specific things about the bus stops the things specifically near you On a larger scale this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at The red circles are polling stations selected by your criteria And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level So that was government data I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some This is the wiki map this is the Open Street Map Terrace Theater I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year I was not the only person editing the open street map Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map Let's now spin the world during the same year Every flash is an edit Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map and realizing it could be better You can see Europe is ablaze with updates Some places perhaps not as much as they should be Here focusing in on Haiti The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be not as good as the map of California Fortunately just after the earthquake GeoEye a commercial company released satellite imagery with a license which allowed the open-source community to use it This is January in time lapse of people editing 。。 that's the earthquake After the earthquake immediately people all over the world mappers who wanted to help and could looked at that imagery built the map quickly building it up We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the satellite images So now we have immediately a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti There's the map showing on the left-hand side that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads damaged buildings refugee camps -- it shows things that are needed for rescue and relief work So if you've been involved in that at all I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing whether you've just been chanting Raw data now or you've been putting government or scientific data online I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much and we have only just started Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning Dr Mullis was talking about his experiments and I realized that I almost became a scientist When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water So I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away The wall was covered with 。。 I had an explosion Richard Saul Wurman: Really FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay I'd like to start this session again The gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous Frank Gehry And Frank you've come to a place in your life which is astonishing I mean it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time I mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny 。。 you know it's a strange thought but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life And I know the road was extremely difficult And it didn't seem at least that your sell outs whatever they were were very big You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody But that's an interesting thing for a creative person A lot of us work for people; we're in the hands of other people And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity: how to do work that's big enough and not sell out And you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big triply big It's not quite a question but you can comment on it It's a big issue FG: Well I've always just 。。 I've never really gone out looking for work I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head And when I started out I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff And I realized when I'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars But I couldn't do anything else That was my response to the people in the time And actually it was responding to clients that I had who didn't have very much money so they couldn't afford very much I think it was circumstantial Until I got to my house where the client was my wife We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it And a few people got excited about it I was visiting with an artist Michael Heizer out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere He's building this huge concrete place And it was late in the evening We'd had a lot to drink We were standing out in the desert all alone and thinking about my house he said Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it So I thought Yeah that's probably a good idea Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money so the stuff was a little more permanent But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long this guy was telling us the other day So where do we go now Back to -- everything's so temporary I don't see it the way you characterized it For me every day is a new thing I approach each project with a new insecurity almost like the first project I ever did and I get the sweats I go in and start working I'm not sure where I'm going -- if I knew where I was going I wouldn't do it When I can predict or plan it I don't do it I discard it So I approach it with the same trepidation Obviously over time I have a lot more confidence that it's going to be OK I do run a kind of a business -- I've got 120 people and you've got to pay them so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with I think a healthy insecurity And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him: you're not sure When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it I saw all the mistakes I saw 。。 They weren't mistakes; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it I felt an embarrassment -- How could I have done that How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it RSW: What's the status of the New York project FG: I don't really know Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me and I thought he was nuts I didn't think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off So I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy He gets up there and then he 。。 comes back up They're still talking about it September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero and I'm totally against that I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time RSW: The picture on the screen is that Disney FG: Yeah RSW: How much further along is it than that and when will that be finished FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September October -- and I'm hoping Kyu and Herbie and Yo-Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place Luckily today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients If you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us are involved with buildings Nothing that you would call architecture right And so to find one a guy like that you hang on to him He's become the head of Art Center and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there I knew Craig and respected him They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful minimalist black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal: Alvaro Siza RSW: Why did you want that FG: I knew you'd ask that question It was intuitive Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work had a resemblance to my early work When I came out of college I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that I tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't 。。 I just stopped I mean Charlie Moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me Siza on the other hand continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra who doesn't think architecture is art Did you see that thing RSW: No What did he say FG: He calls architecture plumbing FG: Anyway the Siza thing It's a richer experience It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it's similar to that I would imagine -- where you 。。 huh Audience: Liquid architecture FG: Liquid architecture Where you 。。 It's like jazz: you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something And I think for me it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus Or is it going to be down near 。。 FG: No it's near the current campus Anyway he's that kind of patron It's not his money of course RSW: What's his schedule on that FG: I don't know What's the schedule Richard Richard Koshalek: Unclear starts from 2004 FG: 2004 You can come to the opening I'll invite you No but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect Like the Rockefeller Center model which is kind of from another era RSW: I found the most remarkable thing My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city That was the surprise of going across the river of going on the highway around it of walking down the street and finding it That was the real surprise of Bilbao FG: But you know Richard most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying Look I'm worried about the context I'm worried about the city I'm worried about my client I worry about budget that I'm on time Blah blah blah and all that stuff And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can 。。 by saying all that it means your work is good somehow And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity You're not going to defy gravity You've got to work with the building department If you don't meet the budgets you're not going to get much work If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak I was so proud The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao I met them in Bilbao They came for three days RSW: This is the computer building FG: Yeah the computer building They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know People put buckets out 。。 I was clean There wasn't a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic But you've got to -- yeah well up until then every building leaked so this 。。 RSW: Frank had a sort of 。。 FG: Ask Miriam RW: 。。 sort of had a fame His fame was built on that in L。A for a while FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story when the woman called and said Mr Wright I'm sitting on the couch and the water's pouring in on my head And he said Madam move your chair So some years later I was doing a building a little house on the beach for Norton Simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said Mr Simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story RSW: Didn't get a laugh FG: No Not now either But my point is that 。。 and I call it the then what OK you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city you're a good guy you're a good person 。。 and then what What do you bring to it And I think that's what I've always been interested in is that -- which is a personal kind of expression Bilbao I think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city That's what reminded me of it And I think that's the issue you know; it's the then what that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that They're hiring them to get it done get it on budget be polite and they're missing out on the real value of an architect RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion before teapots 。。 FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it RSW: Did it leak FG: No RSW: 。。 people wanted a Michael Graves building Is that a curse that people want a Bilbao building FG: Yeah Since Bilbao opened which is now four five years both Krens and I have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China Brazil other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect And I've met with some of these people Usually I say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings In one case I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port I asked them what kind of building it was When you get here we'll explain it Blah blah blah So four of us went And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor Each one was more beautiful than the other And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga Just before going to lunch with the mayor we went to the harbor commissioner It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and I was here and my guys We sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet And the guy looked at me and said Now what can I do for you Mr Gehry RSW: Oh my God FG: So I got up I said to my team Let's get out of here We stood up we walked out They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor I said Nope You're not going to have dinner at all They just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project And we get a lot of that Luckily I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel I don't have my own plane yet RSW: Well I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long But let me just say a couple words FG: Can I say something Are you going to talk about me or you RSW: Once a shit always a shit FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody so 。。 RSW: You're going to get one You're going to get one I'm going to make it for you FG: No no Wait a minute Welcome to Africa Or rather I should say welcome home Because this is where it all really began isn't it Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here We are on an amazing journey the next four days You're going to hear stories of Africa: The Next Chapter Fantastic tales anecdotes from speakers But I want to turn that upside down for a moment and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa And this is not a rhetorical question I actually want answers from you Go for it The worst Famine Corruption More Genocide AIDS Slavery That's enough We've all heard these things But this is about Africa the story we have not heard The stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality the fact from the fiction To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you So let's get going because Africa to some degree is on a turnaround A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career And it all started almost a decade ago as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company at their first African office in Johannesburg And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues and African companies on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States It all began with a fantastic phone call It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine And she said I want to write a case Euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela Because Nelson Mandela as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle Now the case Nelson Mandela: Change Leader became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called Confidence And Confidence became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list And why I tell you this story is because later when I was interviewed on SABC Africa on a pan-African broadcast they asked What is your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most -- because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds Africa was being used as a success story So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation And that has to do with me because in 1994 I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career You should have seen my parents' reaction But very soon I found myself from the southern part of Africa in South Africa -- at the very north in Egypt And I sought out the most remote places I went to the Siwa Oasis That was one of my stops And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle and it foretold his destiny of greatness This was 300 BC So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers Now the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night With no natural light source Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry Fast forward to 2002 I'm sitting in Cambridge Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference And I see the same picture but from the opposite side A satellite picture looking down at the earth And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it I remember the very moment And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point The first thing that I saw was North America at night -- glowing in all its glory A warm feeling Light And then I saw it -- Africa Quite literally the Dark Continent And while Africa may be dark the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing but it's also the opportunity Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there Entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope It was George Kimble the geographer who said that The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer Let's start unpacking it Africa is the second-largest continent a landmass second from Asia It also is the second most populated continent with 900 million people In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States China and the entire Europe into Africa and still have space Africa is home to over 1，000 languages -- 2，000 is another estimate that's out there -- with over 2，000 languages and dialects But you could say Invest in Africa in over 1，000 languages and it wouldn't make a difference What does the data say As an investment banker I'm in the cross-flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent So let's start on that And let's start at the high level on the macro-factors Inflation in general is coming down across Africa -- that's the first sign -- in many countries reaching double-digit figures So let's start looking at some of those I call it my Z。E。N cluster Zambia: from 2004 to 2006 moves from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8。4 percent Nigeria: a similar situation from the 16 percent to the eight percent Single digits More fascinating you have other countries -- South Africa Mauritius Namibia -- all in single digits But that's just part of the story You have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability But that's looking at the big picture And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country It's made up -- It's made up of 53 different countries So the very definition -- to say invest in Africa is a no-go It's meaningless Each country has a unique value proposition You can make money you can lose money in Africa But opportunities boy oh boy they exist And this is what today is about -- it's about discussing those very opportunities So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data I was recently elected as Emeka mentioned as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa But not the South Africa we always talk about -- the gold the minerals the First World infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it For example South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top 1，000 UK companies for offshore call-centers Same language timeline et cetera Makes sense Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR the big boys of private equity Headline in South Africa: They have landed Quite ominous But what were they there for To acquire assets Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon a large retailer is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy Because it is actually a long-term play Being a retailer it is a play on the belief that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue But the story of Africa and my focus is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening Undoubtedly Nigeria is clearly a hot spot Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report The new report The Next Eleven highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world It's an investment opportunity Think about that Is anyone -- our banks our investors -- seriously thinking about going to Nigeria If you haven't why not What's going on in Nigeria A couple of things I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets Bellwether signs again Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa and this excludes South Africa But the first Eurobond the raising of international capital offshore off its own balance sheet without any sovereign backing -- that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy Without any sovereign backing a Nigerian company raising capital offshore It's just a sign of things to come Looking at the oil industry Africa provides 18 percent of the U。S。's oil supply with the Middle East just 16 percent It's an important strategic partner Let's put Nigeria in perspective 2。2 to 2。4 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as Kuwait the same league as Venezuela But with Africa let's start being careful about this And Emeka and I have had these discussions We have to move away from what's called the curse of the commodities Because it's not about oil it's not about commodities For Africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond to other industries So let's unpack those very quickly and I'm going to move through these very very very fast because I can see that clock counting down What else is going on there Egypt Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone -- 2。8 billion investment The announcement just came out the last few weeks Close to the Mediterranean near Alexandria -- textiles petrochemicals It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries -- away from oil Let's look at agriculture Let's look at forestry What's going on there In Tanzania last week we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard Again gathering together farmers gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce Better prices It ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers Again opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price Uganda: the New Forest Company replanting and redeveloping their forests Why is that important As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed we will need poles for rolling out electricity But here is the sweetener in the deal They're going to be tapping into carbon credits Let's go back to Nigeria The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation from over 80 banks to 25 banks Strengthening of the system But what's going on there Only 10 percent of the country is banked The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria 135 million-plus people Think about that There are only 700 ATMs in the country Opportunity The same for telecoms across the country Now let's look at the continent as a whole People look at the roads for example and they'd say Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred Ah problem It's more expensive to transport goods Prices of goods go up inflation is affected Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred Zambia: 80 percent In general more than 50 percent of roads are untarred This is an opportunity Energy needs -- it's an opportunity So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing Let's look at the stock markets in Africa If I had to ask you In 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world Would Egypt come to mind In 2005 the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent What's going on in some of the other countries Let's look at some 2006 numbers Kenya: over 60 percent Nigeria: over 40 percent South Africa: in the 20 percents High ones These are the trends that are taking place But in any investment decision the key question is What is my alternative investment Because in Africa today we are competing globally for capital And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties There's an overhang of capital in the U。S。 and the key is yield pickup What Africa is providing is a diversification play and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing Now when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things comparisons become important 10 years ago there were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard &amp; Poors Moody's and Fitch's Today 16 African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings What does this mean Take Nigeria again: double B-minus -- in the league of Ukraine and Turkey Immediately we have a comparison The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital Some other figures South Africa: triple B-plus Botswana: A-plus Bakino Faso: B-minus And so on In fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa Why are they doing that Because they expect investment to follow So one of the big bellwethers and one of my final points I want to mention is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel Why is CNBC doing this It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen Me and you the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making -- that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline So in conclusion I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago This time I'll give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002 and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent Because there are amazing opportunities available And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly In 1899 Joseph Conrad released The Heart of Darkness a tale of grim horror along the Congo River If one looks carefully on the Congo River is one of those bright lights And that's the very Congo river generating light -- the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power That is a transformation in power of ideas So the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas And perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind that when we convene maybe in the distant future in 2020 that picture will look very different Thank you Thank you I have two missions here today The first is to tell you something about pollen I hope and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose And secondly to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers It carries male sex cells from one flower to another This gives us genetic diversity or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself That's probably true of humans as well mostly Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers Each anther can carry up to 100，000 grains of pollen so it's quite prolific stuff And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen The little hole in the middle we'll come to a bit later but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on A very tiny tube So that's 20 micrometers across that pollen grain there That's about a 50th of a millimeter But not all pollen is quite so simple looking This is Morina This is a plant -- which I've always thought to be rather tedious -- named after Morin who was an enterprising French gardener who issued the first seed catalog in 1621 But anyway take a look at its pollen This is amazing I think That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower just on the right species what happens Like I said pollen carries the male sex cells If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex they have rampant promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex Really My story is actually not about plant propagation but about pollen itself So what are pollen's properties I hear you ask First of all pollen is tiny Yes we know that It's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand Now pollen from plants which are wind-dispersed -- like trees and grasses and so on -- tend to cause the most hay fever And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species Here are some examples -- they're very smooth if you look at them -- of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind Again -- this time sycamore -- wind-dispersed So trees: very boring flowers not really trying to attract insects Cool pollen though This one I particularly like This is the Monterey Pine which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further Remember that thing is just about 30 micrometers across Now it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding This is a bee's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm Very showy to attract lots of insects to do its bidding The pollen has little barbs on it if we look Now those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this if it was the Earth That tells me that it's actually been fossilized this pollen And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves Isn't that cool Okay so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects You can tell that from the little barbs on there All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories No coincidence that these were taken by Rob Kesseler who is an artist and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen Now all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from So different species of plants grow in different places and some pollen carries further than others So if you have a pollen sample then in principle you should be able to tell where that sample came from And this is where it gets interesting for forensics Pollen is tiny It gets on to things and it sticks to them So not only does each type of pollen look different but each habitat has a different combination of plants A different pollen signature if you like or a different pollen fingerprint By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample you can tell very precisely where it came from This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt similar to the one that I'm wearing now Now much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings Where has it been Four very different habitats might look similar but they've got very different pollen signatures Actually this one is particularly easy these pictures were all taken in different countries But pollen forensics can be very subtle It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made where banknotes have come from to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing certainly in the U。K。 to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim So you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs And finally in a rather grizzly way the Bosnia war crimes; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen which showed that bodies had been buried exhumed and then reburied somewhere else I hope I've opened your eyes if you'll excuse the visual pun to some of pollen's secrets This is a horse chestnut There is an invisible beauty all around us each grain with a story to tell 。。 each of us in fact with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us Thank you to the colleagues at Kew and thank you to palynologists everywhere Well this is about state budgets This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning But I want to tell you I think it's an important topic that we need to care about State budgets are big big money -- I'll show you the numbers -- and they get very little scrutiny The understanding is very low Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are And these budgets are the key for our future; they're the key for our kids Most education funding -- whether it's K through 12 or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets But we have a problem Here's the overall picture U。S economy is big -- 14。7 trillion Now out of that pie the government spends 36 percent So this is combining the federal level which is the largest the state level and the local level And it's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what's going on because there's a lot of complex things like Medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries But we're spending 36 percent Well what are we taking in Simple business question Answer is 26 percent Now this leaves 10 percent deficit sort of a mind-blowing number And some of that in fact is due to the fact that we've had an economic recession Receipts go down some spending programs go up but most of it is not because of that Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a huge challenge In fact this is the forecast picture There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher It is an increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do This is what you see at this overall level Now how did we get here How could you have a problem like this After all at least on paper there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced Only one state says they don't have to balance the budget But what this means actually is that there's a pretense There's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges When Jerry Brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him That is through various gimmicks and things a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending Now he's put together some thoughts: About half of that he'll cut another half perhaps in a very complex set of steps taxes will be approved But even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough So you get a big squeeze What were those things that allowed us to hide this Well some really nice little tricks And these were somewhat noticed The paper said It's not really balanced It's got holes It perpetuates deficit spending It's riddled with gimmicks And really when you get down to it the guys at Enron never would have done this This is so blatant so extreme Is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do They borrow money They're not supposed to but they figure out a way They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out They sell off the assets They defer the payments They sell off the revenues from tobacco And California's not unique In fact there's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don't face this big challenge So it's systemic across the entire country It really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations -- health care where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just generosity -- that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time that you've got a problem This is the retiree health care benefits Three million set aside 62 billion dollar liability -- much worse than the car companies And everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem The forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent Well what's going to give Well in order to accommodate that you would have to cut education spending in half It really is this young versus the old to some degree If you don't change that revenue picture if you don't solve what you're doing in health care you're going to be deinvesting in the young The great University of California university system the great things that have gone on won't happen So far it's meant layoffs increased class sizes Within the education community there's this discussion of Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers who get laid off And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes where do you do that How much effect does that have And unfortunately as you get into that people get confused and think well maybe you think that's okay In fact no education spending should not be cut There's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact but it's a problem It's also really a problem for where we need to go Technology has a role to play Well we need money to experiment with that to get those tools in there There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom That's something I think is very very important Well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay In a situation where you have growth you put the new money into this Or even if you're flat you might shift money into it But with the type of cuts we're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence or to move over to use technology in the new way So what's going on Where's the brain trust that's in error here Well there really is no brain trust It's sort of the voters It's sort of us showing up Just look at this spending California will spend over 100 billion Microsoft 38 Google about 19 The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis both inside Google and Microsoft and outside with analysts and people of various opinions -- should they have spent on that No they wasted their money on this What about this thing -- it really is quite phenomenal Everybody has an opinion There's great feedback And the numbers are used to make decisions If you go over the education spending and the health care spending -- particularly these long-term trends -- you don't have that type of involvement on a number that's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning So what do we need to do We need better tools We can get some things out on the Internet I'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture We need lots more There's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from -- how that's changed over time and the challenge We need better accounting We need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting the way they have It should be more like private accounting It's the gold standard And finally we need to really reward politicians Whenever they say there's these long-term problems we can't say Oh you're the messenger with bad news We just shot you In fact there are some like these: Erskine Bowles Alan Simpson and others who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem But in fact their work was sort of pushed off In fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions So we need these pieces Now I think this is a solvable problem It's a great country with lots of people But we have to draw those people in because this is about education And just look at what happened with the tuitions with the University of California and project that out for another three four five years -- it's unaffordable And that's the kind of thing -- the investment in the young -- that makes us great allows us to contribute It allows us to do the art the biotechnology the software and all those magic things And so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they're critical for our kids and our future Thank you We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals assembling that chromosome in yeast transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species So this is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute This is a project that had its inception 15 years ago when our team then -- we called the institute TIGR -- was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism that of Mycoplasma genitalium And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species could there be even a smaller genome Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level It's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell You can only do them one at a time We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route even though nobody had been there before to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life That started our 15-year quest to get here But before we did the first experiments we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks the challenges the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in 1999 Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand In 2002 we started a new institute the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives where we set out two goals: One to understand the impact of our technology on the environment and how to understand the environment better and two to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life In 2003 we published our first success So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free DNA at a small level Our first task was a 5，000-letter code bacteriophage a virus that attacks only E coli So that was the phage phi X 174 which was chosen for historical reasons It was the first DNA phage DNA virus DNA genome that was actually sequenced So once we realized that we could make 5，000-base pair viral-sized pieces we thought we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome So substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially There were several steps to this There were two sides: We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules and we had to solve the biological side of how if we had this new chemical entity how would we boot it up activate it in a recipient cell We had two teams working in parallel: one team on the chemistry and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells When we started this out we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem which is why we chose the smallest genome And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one And we can walk through the reasons for that but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from whereas the larger faster-growing cell takes only two days So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle And you should know that basically 99 probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed So this was a debugging problem-solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there So one of the most important publications we had was in 2007 Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another I think philosophically that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was And we knew once that worked that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there In 2008 we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome a little over 500，000 letters of genetic code but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome We think in part because of its slow growth and in part cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations But at the time that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made And so both sides were progressing but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us It's an amazing step forward but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast So in addition to doing the transplant we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell So our team developed new techniques for actually growing cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them When we did these experiments though we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell That little issue took the team two years to solve It turns out the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme from digesting the DNA So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it we could then transplant it Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell And once we had done that now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome the mycoides chromosome knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence So the team developed new debugging software where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA And we found that 10 out of the 11 100，000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence We narrowed it down to one fragment; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene So accuracy is essential There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA as we did with the watermarks and it can tolerate all kinds of errors So it took about three months to find that error and repair it And then early one morning at 6 a。m we got a text from Dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed So it's been a long route to get here: 15 years from the beginning We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA Early on when you're working in a new area of science you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't and even worse leading others to believe it So we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell when it would have been just a contaminant So early on we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500，000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code but it was using just amino acid single letter translations which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA Now mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers So there are four major watermarks all over 1，000 base pairs of genetic code The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code So in the remaining information in the watermarks contain the names of I think it's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code they can send an email to that address So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species having 46 names in it its own web address And we added three quotations because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work So we won't give the rest of the code but we will give the three quotations The first is To live to err to fall to triumph and to recreate life out of life It's a James Joyce quote The second quotation is See things not as they are but as they might be It's a quote from the American Prometheus book on Robert Oppenheimer And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote: What I cannot build I cannot understand So because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done -- asking for ethical review pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government Even with this announcement as we did in 2003 -- that work was funded by the Department of Energy so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it And they came down on the side of open publication which is the right approach -- we've briefed the White House we've briefed members of Congress we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances So with that I would like to open it first to the floor for questions Yes in the back Reporter: Could you explain in layman's terms how significant a breakthrough this is please Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is It's significant to us Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life We actually view it as a baby step in terms of it's taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool We have at the Institute ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these Dan's team can now make these in less than 24 hours So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out we think we can shorten that process quite substantially In the vaccine area Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date things where the viruses rapidly evolve such with rhinovirus Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds Or more importantly HIV where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes Also at Synthetic Genomics we've been working on major environmental issues I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder We can't see CO2 -- we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it -- but we can see pre-CO2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf We need some alternatives for oil We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO2 Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects and that is the neuroscience of sleep Now there is a sound -- -- aah it worked -- a sound that is desperately desperately familiar to most of us and of course it's the sound of the alarm clock And what that truly ghastly awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have and that's sleep If you're an average sort of person 36 percent of your life will be spent asleep which means that if you live to 90 then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important And yet for most of us we don't give sleep a second thought We throw it away We really just don't think about sleep And so what I'd like to do today is change your views change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep And the journey that I want to take you on we need to start by going back in time Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber Any ideas who said that Shakespeare's Julius Caesar Yes let me give you a few more quotes O sleep O gentle sleep nature's soft nurse how have I frighted thee Shakespeare again from -- I won't say it -- the Scottish play Correction: Henry IV Part 2 From the same time: Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together Extremely prophetic by Thomas Dekker another Elizabethan dramatist But if we jump forward 400 years the tone about sleep changes somewhat This is from Thomas Edison from the beginning of the 20th century Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days Bang And if we also jump into the 1980s some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said Sleep is for wimps And of course the infamous -- what was his name -- the infamous Gordon Gekko from Wall Street said Money never sleeps What do we do in the 20th century about sleep Well of course we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night and we occupied the dark and in the process of this occupation we've treated sleep as an illness almost We've treated it as an enemy At most now I suppose we tolerate the need for sleep and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound Why is it Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts Well it's because you don't do anything much while you're asleep it seems You don't eat You don't drink And you don't have sex Well most of us anyway And so therefore it's -- Sorry It's a complete waste of time right Wrong Actually sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important So let's move to the brain Now here we have a brain This is donated by a social scientist and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed how to use it so -- Sorry So I borrowed it I don't think they noticed Okay The point I'm trying to make is that when you're asleep this thing doesn't shut down In fact some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state The other thing that's really important about sleep is that it doesn't arise from a single structure within the brain but is to some extent a network property and if we flip the brain on its back -- I love this little bit of spinal cord here -- this bit here is the hypothalamus and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures not least the biological clock The biological clock tells us when it's good to be up when it's good to be asleep and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei All of those combine and they send projections down to the brain stem here The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain and essentially sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here Okay So where have we got to We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life But what I haven't explained is what sleep is about So why do we sleep And it won't surprise any of you that of course the scientists we don't have a consensus There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep and I'm going to outline three of those The first is sort of the restoration idea and it's somewhat intuitive Essentially all the stuff we've burned up during the day we restore we replace we rebuild during the night And indeed as an explanation it goes back to Aristotle so that's what 2，300 years ago It's gone in and out of fashion It's fashionable at the moment because what's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways So there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis What about energy conservation Again perhaps intuitive You essentially sleep to save calories Now when you do the sums though it doesn't really pan out If you compare an individual who has slept at night or stayed awake and hasn't moved very much the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night Now that's the equivalent of a hot dog bun Now I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep So I'm less convinced by the energy conservation idea But the third idea I'm quite attracted to which is brain processing and memory consolidation What we know is that if after you've tried to learn a task and you sleep-deprive individuals the ability to learn that task is smashed It's really hugely attenuated So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important However it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep In fact it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage Sleeping at night enhances our creativity And what seems to be going on is that in the brain those neural connections that are important those synaptic connections that are important are linked and strengthened while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important Okay So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons But sleep is not an indulgence It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class you know the equiavlent of It's not even an upgrade from economy to first class The critical thing to realize is that if you don't sleep you don't fly Essentially you never get there and what's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep-deprived So let's now look at sleep deprivation Huge sectors of society are sleep-deprived and let's look at our sleep-o-meter So in the 1950s good data suggests that most of us were getting around about eight hours of sleep a night Nowadays we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours-every-night league For teenagers it's worse much worse They need nine hours for full brain performance and many of them on a school night are only getting five hours of sleep It's simply not enough If we think about other sectors of society the aged if you are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep again less than five hours a night Shift work Shift work is extraordinary perhaps 20 percent of the working population and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night It's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired the body clock is saying Wake up This is the time to be awake So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor again in that sort of five-hour region And then of course tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag So who here has jet lag Well my goodness gracious Well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because that's what your brain is craving One of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps this involuntary falling asleep and you have essentially no control over it Now micro-sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing but they can also be deadly It's been estimated that 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the U。S。 the statistics are pretty good: 100，000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep A hundred thousand a year It's extraordinary At another level of terror we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger which was so tragically lost And in the investigations that followed those disasters poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters So when you're tired and you lack sleep you have poor memory you have poor creativity you have increased impulsiveness and you have overall poor judgment But my friends it's so much worse than that If you are a tired brain the brain is craving things to wake it up So drugs stimulants Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world Much of the day is fueled by caffeine and if you're a really naughty tired brain nicotine And of course you're fueling the waking state with these stimulants and then of course it gets to 11 o'clock at night and the brain says to itself Ah well actually I need to be asleep fairly shortly What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired Well of course you then resort to alcohol Now alcohol short-term you know once or twice to use to mildly sedate you can be very useful It can actually ease the sleep transition But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep a biological mimic for sleep It sedates you So it actually harms some of the neural proccessing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall So it's a short-term acute measure but for goodness sake don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain If you sleep around about five hours or less every night then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese What's the connection here Well sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin the hunger hormone Ghrelin is released It gets to the brain The brain says I need carbohydrates and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars So there's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain Stress Tired people are massively stressed And one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of But stress is so much more So if you're acutely stressed not a great problem but it's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that's the problem So sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and there's some very good studies showing that shift workers for example have higher rates of cancer Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant Therefore diabetes 2 Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure So there's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides So at this point in the talk this is a nice time to think well do you think on the whole I'm getting enough sleep So a quick show of hands Who feels that they're getting enough sleep here Oh Well that's pretty impressive Good We'll talk more about that later about what are your tips So most of us of course ask the question Well how do I know whether I'm getting enough sleep Well it's not rocket science If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning if you are taking a long time to get up if you need lots of stimulants if you're grumpy if you're irritable if you're told by your work colleagues that you're looking tired and irritable chances are you are sleep-deprived Listen to them Listen to yourself What do you do Well -- and this is slightly offensive -- sleep for dummies: Make your bedroom a haven for sleep The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool Very important Actually reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep What's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed We stand in a massively lit bathroom looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth It's the worst thing we can possibly do before we went to sleep Turn off those mobile phones Turn off those computers Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day ideally not after lunch Now we've set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light-dark cycle So seek out morning light Basically listen to yourself Wind down Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honey-heavy dew of slumber Okay That's some facts What about some myths Teenagers are lazy No Poor things They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late so give them a break We need eight hours of sleep a night That's an average Some people need more Some people need less And what you need to do is listen to your body Do you need that much or do you need more Simple as that Old people need less sleep Not true The sleep demands of the aged do not go down Essentially sleep fragments and becomes less robust but sleep requirements do not go down And the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise Well that's wrong at so many different levels There is no no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all There's no difference in socioeconomic status In my experience the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug Okay So for the last part the last few minutes what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between mental health mental illness and sleep disruption We've known for 130 years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption but it's been largely ignored In the 1970s when people started to think about this again they said Yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia because they're on anti-psychotics It's the anti-psychotics causing the sleep problems ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously sleep disruption had been reported before anti-psychotics So what's going on Lots of groups several groups are studying conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what's going on in terms of sleep disruption We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia and the data were quite extraordinary In those individuals with schizophrenia much of the time they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day Other groups showed no 24-hour patterns whatsoever Their sleep was absolutely smashed And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light-dark cycle They were getting up later and later and later and later each night It was smashed So what's going on And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated but they are physically linked within the brain The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping And what's the evidence for that Well genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems And last year we published a study which showed that a gene that's been linked to schizophrenia which when mutated also smashes the sleep So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems Other work flowed from these studies The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness and we've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make worse the mental illness state My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by 50 percent So what have we got We've got in these connections some really exciting things In terms of the neuroscience by understanding the neuroscience of these two systems we're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in If we know that these individuals are vulnerable early intervention then becomes possible And the third which I think is the most exciting is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness So let me just finish What I started by saying is take sleep seriously Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre-industrial age when we were almost wrapped in a duvet We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep And this isn't some sort of crystal-waving nonsense This is a pragmatic response to good health If you have good sleep it increases your concentration attention decision-making creativity social skills health If you get sleep it reduces your mood changes your stress your levels of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions Jim Butcher the fantasy writer said Sleep is God Go worship And I can only recommend that you do the same Thank you for your attention On September 10 the morning of my seventh birthday I came downstairs to the kitchen where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway and they said Hey happy birthday And I said I'm seven And my father smiled and said Well you know what that means don't you And I said Yeah that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents And my dad said Well yes But more importantly being seven means that you've reached the age of reason and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man Now I had heard this phrase age of reason before Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school But when she said it the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil and anyway I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase age of reason So I said Yeah yeah age of reason What does that mean again And my dad said Well we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong but when you're seven you're old enough to know better So you've grown up and reached the age of reason and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record And I said Oh Wait a minute You mean all that time up till today all that time I was so good God didn't notice it And my mom said Well I noticed it And I thought How could I not have known this before How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me All that being good and no real credit for it And worst of all how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me So I said Well Mom and Dad what about Santa Claus I mean Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice right And my dad said Yeah but honey I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas And my mother said Oh Bob stop it Let's just tell her I mean she's seven Julie there is no Santa Claus Now this was actually not that upsetting to me My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning our family would give Santa more time Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss Which made me very suspicious It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents I mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's Plus why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment this humiliation of rejection by Santa who was jolly -- but let's face it he was also very judgmental So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing It was too late for me but maybe I could help someone else someone who could use the information They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven The answer was clear: my brother Bill He was six Well I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground It was a Saturday and he was all by himself just kicking a ball against the side of a wall I ran up to him and said Bill I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man And Bill said So And then I said So you're six You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it And he said So And I said So So everything And I turned to run I was so angry with him But when I got to the top of the steps I turned around dramatically and said Oh by the way Bill there is no Santa Claus Now I didn't know it at the time but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10 For my 13th birthday I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said I need to speak to you privately September 10 is not your birthday It's October 10 And I said What And she said Listen The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15 So I told them that your birthday was on September 10 and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10 But Julie you were so ready to start school honey You were so ready I thought about it and when I was four I was already the oldest of four children and my mother even had another child to come so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready she was so ready Then she said Don't worry Julie every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day Which was comforting but troubling My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me without me What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom and I read my horoscope every single day and it was so totally me And this meant that I was a Libra So I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair sort of lounging by some water but the Libra poster is just a huge scale This was around the time that I started filling out physically and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls and frankly the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing But I got the new Libra poster and I started to read my new Libra horoscope and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me It wasn't until years later looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me Oh life can be so cruel One day two Mormon missionaries came to my door Now I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles and my block is -- well it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them So normally I just ignore the doorbell but on this day I answered And there stood two boys each about 19 in white starched short-sleeved shirts and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and they said they had a message for me from God I said A message for me From God And they said Yes Now I was raised in the Pacific Northwest around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and you know I've worked with them and even dated them but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission and I guess I was sort of curious so I said Well please come in And they looked really happy because I don't think this happens to them all that often And I sat them down and I got them glasses of water -- OK I got it I got them glasses of water Don't touch my hair that's the thing You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair OK So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water and after niceties they said Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart And I thought Well of course I believe in God but you know I don't like that word heart because it anthropomorphizes God and I don't like the word 'his，' either because that sexualizes God But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys so after a very long uncomfortable pause I said Yes yes I do I feel very loved And they looked at each other and smiled like that was the right answer And then they said Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet And I said Yes I do Yes I do And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly And they said Well then we have a story to tell you And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC Now apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC everyone was completely bad and evil Every single one of them: man woman child infant fetus And God came to Lehi and said to him Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here And God did lead them He led them to America I said America From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC And they said Yes Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them the Nephites and the Lamanites and the Nephites were totally totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone Then after Jesus died on the cross for our sins on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites And he told them that if they all remained totally totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites But apparently somebody blew it because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites All but one guy this guy named Mormon who managed to survive by hiding in the woods And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates which he then buried near Palmyra New York Well I was just on the edge of my seat I said What happened to the Lamanites And they said Well they became our Native Americans here in the U。S And I said So you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil And they said Yes Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English Well at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch I wanted to say OK don't start with this story I mean even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu the evil intergalactic overlord Well then they said Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets And I said No I don't Because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story but the truth was I hadn't really thought this through so I backpedaled a little and I said Well what exactly do you mean by righteous And what do you mean by prophets Like could the prophets be women And they said No And I said Why And they said Well it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular it is so wonderful that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy What is this wonderful gift God gave women I wondered Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt Women's longer lifespan The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men But no it wasn't any of these gifts They said Well it's her ability to bear children I said Oh come on I mean even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 assuming they didn't die from exhaustion it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God And they said No Well then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more but they had more to say They said Well we also believe that if you're a Mormon and if you're in good standing with the church when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity And I said Oh dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me And they said Oh -- hey well we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state Like if you'd lost a leg well you get it back Or if you'd gone blind you could see I said Oh -- now I don't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago So does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back And they said Sure And I said I don't want it back I'm happy without it Gosh What if you had a nose job and you liked it Would God force you to get your old nose back Well then they gave me this Book of Mormon and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me and I think I said something like Please don't hurry or maybe it was just Please don't and they were gone OK so I initially felt really superior to these boys and smug in my more conventional faith But then the more I thought about it the more I had to be honest with myself If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time and they said We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby and that's the son of God I mean I would think that's equally ridiculous I'm just so used to that story So I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question Now if they'd asked me Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart Well that would have been much different I think I would have instantly answered Yes yes I feel it all the time I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused and I feel consoled and cared for I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it somehow it was all different because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt Roy Gould: Less than a year from now the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy which marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope In a few months the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago It's called the WorldWide Telescope and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention And I want to urge you when you get a chance to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs The WorldWide Telescope takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space and has woven them seamlessly to produce a holistic view of the universe It's going to change the way we do astronomy it's going to change the way we teach astronomy and I think most importantly it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day that might not be so big a claim In 1920 for example you weren't allowed to drink; if you were a woman you weren't allowed to vote; and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night what you saw was thought to be the entire universe In fact the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe Harvard was wrong big time Of course we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe all the way back in time almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself We can see across the entire spectrum of light revealing worlds that had previously been invisible We see these magnificent star nurseries where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise We see alien worlds we see alien solar systems -- 300 now and still counting -- and they're not like us We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy in the Milky Way and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still But until now our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks And that's changing I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I in astronomy and in education are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative First it enables you to experience the universe: the WorldWide Telescope for me is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place And third you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about because I think that at heart we are all storytellers And in telling stories each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way We're going to have a personal universe I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge Before I introduce the person responsible for the WorldWide Telescope I just want to leave you with this brief thought: when I ask people How does the night sky make you feel they often say Oh tiny I feel tiny and insignificant Well our gaze fills the universe And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny but we are truly wonderfully significant Thank you I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft Curtis Wong: Thank you Roy So what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation but it's one of the tours And actually this tour is one that was created earlier And the tours are all totally interactive so that if I were to go somewhere 。。 you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in you can pull back out The whole resources are there available for you So Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray who's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible It's a labor of love for us and our small team and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe So basically kids of all ages like us And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring It'll be a free download -- thank you Craig Mundie -- and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope。org which is something new And so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the TED Lab we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off So we'll see you there Thank you I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two biospheres Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1 I've also lived in Biosphere 2 And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres And hopefully from that I get to learn something So what did I learn Well here I am inside Biosphere 2 making a pizza So I am harvesting the wheat in order to make the dough And then of course I have to milk the goats and feed the goats in order to make the cheese It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza Here in Biosphere 1 well it takes me about two minutes because I pick up the phone and I call and say Hey can you deliver the pizza So Biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre entirely sealed miniature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely sealed So we had our own miniature rainforest a private beach with a coral reef We had a savanna a marsh a desert We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything And of course we had our human habitat where we lived Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2 we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions I mean what is a biosphere Back then yes I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth right Well you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is nothing goes in or out at all no material -- and energetically open which is essentially what planet Earth is This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2 that we called our Test Module And the very first day that this fellow John Allen walked in to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there to hopefully keep him alive the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something fungus But of course none of that happened And over the ensuing few years there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2 But by 1991 we finally had this thing built And it was time for us to go in and give it a go We needed to know is life this malleable Can you take this biosphere that has evolved on a planetary scale and jam it into a little bottle and will it survive Big questions And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars for instance would we take a biosphere with us to live in it We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in Well in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby Let's take it on a maiden voyage Will it work Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres So eight of us went in: four men and four women More on that later And this is the world that we lived in So on the top we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean and underneath we had all this technosphere we called it which is where all the pumps and the valves and the water tanks and the air handlers and all of that One of the Biospherians called it garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier And then also we had the human habitat of course with the laboratories and all of that This is the agriculture It was essentially an organic farm The day I walked into Biosphere 2 I was for the first time breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world except seven other people At that moment I became part of that biosphere And I don't mean that in an abstract sense; I mean it rather literally When I breathed out my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes And those sweet potatoes became part of me In fact we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way When it came to our atmosphere however it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term because it turned out that we were losing oxygen quite a lot of oxygen And we knew that we were losing CO2 And so we were working to sequester carbon Good lord -- we know that term now We were growing plants like crazy We were taking their biomass storing them in the basement growing plants going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere We stopped irrigating our soil as much as we could We stopped tilling so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up which was quite unexpected because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek We had lost seven tons of oxygen And we had no clue where it was And I tell you when you lose a lot of oxygen -- and our oxygen went down quite far; it went from 21 percent down to 14。2 percent -- my goodness do you feel dreadful I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere And we had sleep apnea at night So you'd wake up gasping with breath because your blood chemistry has changed And that you literally do that You stop breathing and then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up And it's very irritating And everybody outside thought we were dying I mean the media was making it sound like were were dying And I had to call up my mother every other day saying No Mum it's fine fine We're not dead We're fine We're fine And the doctor was in fact checking us to make sure we were in fact fine But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures And it was time for us to put oxygen in And you might think well Boy your life support system was failing you Wasn't that dreadful Yes In a sense it was terrifying Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door at any time if it really got bad though who was going to say I can't take it anymore！ Not me that was for sure But on the other hand it was the scientific gold of the project because we could really crank this baby up as a scientific tool and see if we could in fact find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone And we did indeed find it And we found it in the concrete Essentially it had done something very simple We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air; it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete Pretty straightforward really So at the end of the two years when we came out we were elated because in fact although you might say we had discovered something that was quite uhh when your oxygen is going down stopped working essentially in your life support system that's a very bad failure Except that we knew what it was And we knew how to fix it And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that And we proved the concept more or less People on the other hand was a different subject We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable We all went quite nuts I will say And the day I came out of Biosphere 2 I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass And everybody ran up to me And I recoiled They stank People stink We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant and all kinds of stuff Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean but nothing with perfume And boy do we stink out here Not only that but I lost touch of where my food came from I had been growing all my own food I had no idea what was in my food where it came from I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating In fact I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops reading all the names on all of the things People must have thought I was nuts It was really quite astonishing And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big biosphere in this big biosphere that we all live in In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere everyday and it had an impact on me very viscerally very literally So I went about my business: Paragon Space Development Corporation a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere because I had nothing else to do And one of the things we did was try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres and what can you do with them And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station for 16 months where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are And I'm also proud to announce that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce that we're actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon which is going to be pretty fun And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing: an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system As a result of that modeling I ended up in all places in Eritrea in the Horn of Africa Eritrea formerly part of Ethiopia is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful incredibly stark and I have no understanding of how people eke out a living there It is so dry This is what I saw But this is also what I saw I saw a company that had taken seawater and sand and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it And it will produce a food crop In this case it was oilseed It was astonishing They were also producing mangroves in a plantation And the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals so that they could produce milk and whatnot like we had in the Biosphere And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth frankly from an environmental point of view They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean They also pollute their next-door neighbors So they're all shitting each other's ponds quite literally And what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these and turning them into all of this food They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people They had created an industrial ecosystem of a sense I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program under the U。N Kyoto Protocol system And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp I was thinking to myself How do you put a box around this When I'm modeling a plant in a box literally I know where to draw the boundary In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea Well of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth And understand its interactions with the entire Earth And put your project in that context Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation from what I would call a biocidal species one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally -- have designed our systems to kill life a lot of the time This is in fact this beautiful photograph is in fact over the Amazon And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation And those beautiful wispy clouds are in fact fires human-made fires We're in the process of transforming from this to what I would call a biophilic society one where we learn to nurture society Now it may not seem like it but we are It is happening all across the world in every kind of walk of life and every kind of career and industry that you can think of And I think often times people get lost in that They go But how can I possibly find my way in that It's such a huge subject And I would say that the small stuff counts It really does This is the story of a rake in my backyard This was my backyard very early on when I bought my property And in Arizona of course everybody puts gravel down And they like to keep everything beautifully raked And they keep all the leaves away And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out and I want to throttle them It's a certain type of aesthetic We're very uncomfortable with untidiness And I threw away my rake And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property And over time essentially what have I been doing I've been building topsoil And so now all the birds come in And I have hawks And I have an oasis This is what happens every spring For six weeks six to eight weeks I have this flush of green oasis This is actually in a riparian area And all of Tucson could be like this if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake The small stuff counts The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus -- has given us this the ability to light up the world It has also given us this the ability to look at the world from the outside Now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to and compare it to this biosphere But we can look at the world and try to understand where we are in its context and how we choose to interact with it And if you lose where you are in your biosphere or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere I would say to you take a deep breath The yogis had it right Breath does in fact connect us all in a very literal way Take a breath now And as you breathe think about what is in your breath There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here It also connects us in time There may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now that will be in the breath of your great-great-great-grandchildren Thank you I want to talk to you about something kind of big We'll start here 65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day A chunk of rock six miles across moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet slammed into the Earth It released its energy all at once and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War lumped them together and blew them up at the same time that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment The dinosaurs had a really bad day Okay Now a six-mile-wide rock is very large We all live here in Boulder If you look out your window and you can see Long's Peak you're probably familiar with it Now scoop up Long's Peak and put it out in space Take Meeker Mt Meeker Lump that in there and put that in space as well and Mt Everest and K2 and the Indian peaks Then you're starting to get an idea of how much rock we're talking about okay We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left It hit in what we now know as Yucatan the Gulf of Mexico You can see here there's the Yucatan Peninsula if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there Here is how big of a crater was left It was huge To give you a sense of the scale okay there you go The scale here is 50 miles on top a hundred kilometers on the bottom This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet threw up enough dust to block out the sun It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth Now not all asteroids are that big Some of them are smaller Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992 It came in on a Friday night Why is that important Because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and people would bring them parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids play football And since this came in on a Friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina Maryland Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York Now this is not a 200-mile-wide crater but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here about the size of a football that hit that car and did that damage Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in It broke up through atmospheric pressure it crumbled and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage Now you wouldn't want that falling on your foot or your head because it would do that to it That would be bad But it won't wipe out you know all life on Earth so that's fine But it turns out you don't need something six miles across to do a lot of damage There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to near Winslow Arizona there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater To give you a sense of scale this is about a mile wide If you look up at the top that's a parking lot and those are recreational vehicles right there So it's about a mile across 600 feet deep The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here It came in at speeds that were tremendous slammed into the ground blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb -- a very hefty bomb This was 50，000 years ago so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope or something like that out in the desert but it probably would not have caused global devastation It turns out that these things don't have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage Now in 1908 over Siberia near the Tunguska region -- for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw Ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909 where he got the date wrong but that's okay It was 1908 That's fine I can live with that Another rock came into the Earth's atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground several miles up above the surface of the Earth The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles okay This did a huge amount of damage And again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we're sitting in In Meteor Crater it was made of metal and metal is much tougher so it made it to the ground The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock and that's much more crumbly so it blew up in the air Either way these are tremendous explosions 20 megatons Now when these things blow up they're not going to do global ecological damage They're not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did They're just not big enough But they will do global economic damage because they don't have to hit necessarily to do this kind of damage They don't have to do global devastation If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere it would cause a panic But if it came over a city an important city -- not that any city is more important than others but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization So now that I've scared the crap out of you 。。 what can we do about this All right This is a potential threat Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years They're very rare The smaller ones happen more often but probably on the order of a millennium every few centuries or every few thousand years but it's still something to be aware of Well what do we do about them The first thing we have to do is find them This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009 It's right here But you can see that it's extremely faint I don't even know if you can see that in the back row These are just stars This is a rock that was about 30 yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50，000 years ago These things are faint They're hard to see and the sky is really big We have to find these things first Well the good news is we're looking for them NASA has devoted money to this The National Science Foundation other countries are very interested in doing this We're building telescopes that are looking for the threat That's a great first step but what's the second step The second step is that we see one heading toward us we have to stop it What do we do You've probably heard about the asteroid Apophis If you haven't yet you will If you've heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse you're going to hear about Apophis because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 It's roughly 250 yards across so it's pretty big -- big size you know bigger than a football stadium -- and it's going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029 And it's going to pass us so close that it's actually going to come underneath our weather satellites The Earth's gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it's just right if it passes through this region of space this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole the Earth's gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13 which is a Friday I'll note in the year 2036 。。 -- you can't plan that kind of stuff -- Apophis is going to hit us And it's 250 meters across so it would do unbelievable damage Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million roughly -- very very low odds so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all I don't think Apophis is a problem In fact Apophis is a blessing in disguise because it woke us up to the dangers of these things This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now It won't but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids We didn't really necessarily understand these keyholes and now we do and it turns out that's really important because how do you stop an asteroid like this Well let me ask you what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you What do you do You do this Right Move The car goes past you But we can't move the Earth at least not easily but we can move a small asteroid And it turns out we've even done it In the year 2005 NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet Comets are very much like asteroids The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet which we learned quite a bit about We did move the comet a little tiny bit not very much but that wasn't the point However think about this This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second 20 miles per second We shot a space probe at it and hit it Okay Imagine how hard that must be and we did it That means we can do it again If we need if we see an asteroid that's coming toward us and it's headed right for us and we have two years to go boom We hit it You can try to -- you know if you watch the movies you might think about why don't we use a nuclear weapon It's like well you can try that but the problem is timing You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you'll just miss it And there are a lot of other problems with that It's very hard to do But just hitting something That's pretty easy I think even NASA can do that and they proved that they can The problem is what happens if you hit this asteroid you've changed the orbit you measure the orbit and then you find out oh yeah we just pushed it into a keyhole and now it's going to hit us in three years Well my opinion is fine Okay It's not hitting us in six months That's good Now we have three years to do something else And you can hit it again That's kind of ham-fisted You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever so you don't do that And this is the part it's the part I just love After the big macho Rrrrrrr BAM We're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation For those of you who've read The Little Prince you understand that reference I hope The little prince who lived on an asteroid it was called B612 These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts like I said engineers Rusty Schweickart who was an Apollo 9 astronaut is on this Dan Durda my friend who made this image works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder on Walnut Street He created this image for this and he's actually one of the astronomers who works for them If we see an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth and we have enough time we can hit it to move it into a better orbit But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two It doesn't have to be huge -- couple of tons not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid You don't land on it because these things are tumbling end over end It's very hard to land on them Instead you get near it The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe and the probe has a couple of tons of mass It has a little tiny bit of gravity but it's enough that it can pull the asteroid and you have your rockets set up so you can -- oh you can barely see it here but there's rocket plumes -- and you basically these guys are connected by their own gravity and if you move the probe very slowly very very gently you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it although that's a whole other thing I won't go into that But we'd be rich So think about this right There are these giant rocks flying out there and they're hitting us and they're doing damage to us but we've figured out how to do this and all the pieces are in place to do this We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them We have smart people very very smart people who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem and we have the technology to do this This probe actually can't use chemical rockets Chemical rockets provide too much thrust too much push The probe would just shoot away We invented something called an ion drive which is a very very very low-thrust engine It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand incredibly light but it can run for months and years providing that very gentle push If anybody here is a fan of the original Star Trek they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive and Spock said They're very technically sophisticated They're a hundred years ahead of us with this drive Yeah we have an ion drive now We don't have the Enterprise but we've got an ion drive now Spock So 。。 that's the difference that's the difference between us and the dinosaurs This happened to them It doesn't have to happen to us The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote and so we can change our future We have the ability to change our future 65 million years from now we don't have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum Thank you very much When I was about 16 years old I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation looking for a movie to watch on HBO -- and how many of you remember Ferris Bueller's Day Off Oh yeah great movie right -- Well I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen and so I thought Sweet Ferris Bueller I'll watch this It wasn't Ferris Bueller And forgive me Matthew Broderick I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time He was in a movie called Torch Song Trilogy And Torch Song Trilogy was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about And as I'm watching it I'm realizing that they're talking about me Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part The finding love and respect the part about trying to find your place in the world So as I'm watching this I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears and it stuck with me for the past 25 years And there's this quote that the main character Arnold tells his mother as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand I've taught myself to sew cook fix plumbing build furniture I can even pat myself on the back when necessary all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16 I was in tears I was in the closet and I'm looking at these two people Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before fighting for love When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was and was really quite happy to tell you the truth I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was -- gay being happy not gay being attracted to the same sex In fact I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle Now I'm sitting here trying to figure out the gay lifestyle the gay lifestyle and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle lifestyle lifestyle I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism That's when I got scared Because I'm thinking if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization I need to figure out what this stuff is and I need to stop doing it right now So I took a look at my life a hard look at my life and I saw some things very disturbing And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you starting with my mornings I drink coffee Not only do I drink coffee I know other gay people who drink coffee I get stuck in traffic -- evil evil traffic Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports I look around and I go My God look at all these gay people We're all trapped in these lines These long lines trying to get on an airplane My God this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil I clean up This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier And because I have a 15-year-old all I do is cook and cook and cook Any parents out there of teenagers All we do is cook for these people -- they eat two three four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous This is the gay lifestyle And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic my partner and I we get together and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on American Idol We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle Run for your heterosexual lives people When my partner Steve and I first started dating he told me this story about penguins And I didn't know where he was going with it at first He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble And then he reaches into his pocket and he brings this out to me And I looked at it and I was like this is really cool And he says I want to spend the rest of my life with you So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous like I don't know a TEDx talk I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time And sometimes I just wear it just because How many people out there are in love Anyone in love out there You might be gay Because I too am in love and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about You may want to tell your spouse Who if they're in love might be gay as well How many of you are single Any single people out there You too might be gay Because I know some gay people who are also single It's really scary this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it It goes and goes and engulfs It's really quite silly isn't it That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say that he supports -- that he supports marriage equality It's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say enough of this -- first to himself and then to the rest of the world It's wonderful But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago And that is apparently this is just another move by the gay activists that's on the gay agenda And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time I've been to all of the functions I've been to fundraisers I've written about the topic and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda I've paid my dues on time I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda It's very very frustrating and I was feeling left out like I wasn't quite gay enough But then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping as I tend to do and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda And I said to myself LZ for so long you have been denied this When you get in front of this crowd you're gonna share the news You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder what exactly is in the gay agenda What are these gays up to What do they want So without further ado I will present to you ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful 'cause it's evil -- a copy the official copy of the gay agenda The gay agenda people There it is Did you soak it all in The gay agenda Some of you may be calling it what the Constitution of the United States is that what you call it too The U。S Constitution is the gay agenda These gays people like me want to be treated like full citizens and it's all written down in plain sight I was blown away when I saw it I was like wait this is the gay agenda Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset But there it is The gay agenda Run for your heterosexual lives Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that people who are gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered Not based upon the quality of your work how long you've been there if you stink just if you're gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda also known as the U。S Constitution Specifically this little amendment right here: No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States I'm looking at you North Carolina But you're not looking at the U。S Constitution This is the gay agenda: equality Not special rights but the rights that were already written by these people -- these elitists if you will Educated well-dressed some would dare say questionably dressed Nonetheless our forefathers right The people that we say knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution -- the gay agenda if you will All of that flies in the face of what they did That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda Because I figured if I made it funny you wouldn't be as threatened I figured if I was a bit irreverent you wouldn't find it serious But when you see the map and you see our state of Michigan -- it's legal to fire someone for being gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay lesbian bisexual or transgendered then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away it's about granting them the rights that have already been stated And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated that we've already agreed upon There are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don't show anyone who they really are right here at home This isn't just about North Carolina; all those states that were clear it's legal If I could brag for a second I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage He has a 4。0 He is starting a new club at school Policy Debate He's a budding track star; he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in He volunteers He prays before he eats I would like to think as his father -- and he lives with me primarily -- that I had a little something to do with all of that I would like to think that he's a good boy a respectful young man I would like to think that I've proven to be a capable father But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage I would be disqualified for only one reason: because I'm gay It doesn't matter what I've already proven what I can do with my heart It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption And that's not just about me that's about so many other Michiganders U。S citizens who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history There was a time in which I don't know people who were black couldn't have the same rights People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights couldn't vote There was a point in our history in which if you were considered disabled that an employer could just fire you before the Americans with Disabilities Act We keep doing this over and over again And so here we are 2012 gay agenda gay lifestyle and I'm not a good dad and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are not who they are So when you hear the words gay lifestyle and gay agenda in the future I encourage you to do two things: One remember the U。S Constitution and then two if you wouldn't mind looking to your left please Look to your right That person next to you is a brother is a sister And they should be treated with love and respect Thank you Every presentation needs this slide in it It's beautiful isn't it Do you see All the points all the lines -- it's incredible It is the network; and in my case the network has been important in media because I get to connect to people Isn't it amazing Through that I connect to people And the way that I've been doing it has been multifaceted For example I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners I put together projects like Earth Sandwich where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth And people started laying bread in tribute and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain It's pretty incredible -- the video's online Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example In YoungmeNowme the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult This is the same person -- top photo James bottom photo Jennifer Poignant This was a Mother's Day gift Particularly creepy My favorite of these photos which I couldn't find is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny little old lady peaking over his shoulder But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people This is project called Ray And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio Somebody said You have to listen to this And this is what came to me Recording: Hi my name is Ray and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair Being quite disturbed she called for comfort and I didn't really know what to tell her because we have to deal with so much mess in our society So I was led to write this song just for her just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job And I figured I'd put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job Here's how the song goes I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh if you don't leave me alone you gonna have to send me home 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass Now you might not be able to sing that out loud but you can hum it to yourself and you know what the words are And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job All right Stay strong Peace Ze Frank: So -- yeah No no no shush We've got to go quickly So I was so moved by this -- this is incredible This was connecting right This was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something wanting to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him And I asked my audience I said Listen to this piece of audio We have to remix it He's got a great voice It's actually in the key of B flat And have to do something with it Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts One stood out in particular It was done by a guy named Goose Remix: I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh I'm about to whip somebody's ass Oh if you don't leave me alone You gonna have to send me home Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass I'm about to whip some -- ZF: Great so it was incredible That song -- Thank you So that song somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City In the end it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services And so I said Let's put this together in an album And the audience came together and they designed an album cover And I said If you put it all on this I'm going to deliver it to him if you can figure out who this person is because all I had was his name -- Ray -- and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset In two weeks they found him I received and email and it said Hi I'm Ray I heard you were looking for me And I was like Yeah Ray It's been an interesting two weeks And so I flew to St Louis and met Ray and he's a preacher -- among other things So but anyways here's the thing -- is it reminds me of this which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world I look at this photo and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street And it makes me think of this On street corners everywhere people are looking at their cell phones and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture But the truth is life is being lived there When they smile -- right you've seen people stop -- all of a sudden life is being lived there somewhere up in that weird dense network And this is it right to feel and be felt It's the fundamental force that we're all after We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier but ultimately what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out I think of the people that build all this technology in the network a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade So here's a series of projects over the last few years where I've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection Sometimes they're very very simple things A Childhood Walk which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor's house and take it inside of Google Streetview And I promise you if you take that walk inside Google Streetview you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face And I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories specifically Our conversation started with me saying 'I'm bored，' and her replying 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels。' I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola They used some of the morbidly artist footage a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway I guess the shoes came off when he was hit He slept over at my house once and he left his pillow It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it He died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract This is Pain Pack Right after September 11th last year I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excise it from our bodies So what I did is I opened up a hotline -- a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event And people called in and left messages like this Recording: Okay here's something I'm not alone and I am loved I'm really fortunate But sometimes I feel really lonely And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry Like even people in convenience stores saying Have a nice day when they're accidentally looking me in the eye ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails and with their permission converted them to MP3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material We don't have time to play much of it You can look at it online From 52 to 48 with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where McCain and Obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation and I was like What the hell does that look like So I thought Well let's just give it a try Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation And so some really nice things came together I voted blue I voted red Together for our future These are very very cute little things right Some came from the winning party Dear 48 I promise to listen to you to fight for you to respect you always Some came from the party who had just lost From a 48 to a 52 may your party's leadership be as classy as you but I doubt it But the truth was that as this start becoming popular a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which I could also see And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail death threats even And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages and he was dressed as Batman And he said I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me; which actually made me feel a little better -- like Phew it's not him So what I did -- unfortunately I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me and it started to eat away at my psyche And I was protecting the project from it I realized I was protecting it -- I didn't want this special little group of photographs to get sullied in some way So what I did I took all those emails and I put them together into something called Angrigami which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami But this was the emotional moment One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate It's amazing The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know where the idea was I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects So one of them was fairly straightforward A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her his daughter And I said Oh yeah I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep And this was Scared This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something I don't know why but it helps me get over it The words of the song just move me along And somehow I get over it At least I don't suck at life I keep on trying despite At least I don't suck at life I keep on trying despite This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something Okay so I wrote that song right Thank you So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point and she actually was singing that song to herself So I was like Awesome This is great And then I got this email And there's a little bit of a back story to this And I don't have much time But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me And I got a lot like 30 in a half an hour And I shut that part down And I chose two people to be and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook One person sent me a very detailed description; the other person didn't And the person who didn't it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job So you know people were writing me and saying How's your new job I was like I don't know Didn't know I had one But anyway this same person Laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project And I felt badly for not having done a good job And she said I'm really anxious I just moved to a new town I have this new job and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety So she had seen the Scared song and wondered if I could do something So I asked her What does it feel like when you feel this way And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety And so what I decided to do I said Okay I'll think about it And so quietly in the background I started sending people this Hey You're okay You'll be fine So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on so I could just get their voices back And this is the kind of thing that I got back Recording: Hey You're okay You'll be fine ZF: So that's one of the better ones really But what's awesome is as I started getting more and more and more of them all of a sudden I had 30 40 voices from around the world And when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world And what was really great is I'm putting all this work together in the background and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by And she said I know you've forgotten about me I just want to say thanks for even considering it And then a few days later I sent her this Right now it feels like I forgot to turn the light on And things that looked so good yesterday are now shades of gray And it seems like the world is spinning while I'm standing still Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell And then you say Hey You're okay You'll be fine Just breathe And now the words sing Hey You're okay You'll be fine Just breathe Now everybody sings Hey You're okay You'll be fine Just breathe Hey You're okay You'll be fine Just breathe Hey You're okay You'll be fine Just breathe Thank you Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage but we still can't do that with water and here's why Right now if you want to test water in the field you need a trained technician expensive equipment like this and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results It's too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing And it ignores the fact that in the meanwhile people still need to drink water Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing water; it came from forms like this which documented all the people we failed to help Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they're safe I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known We think there's a simpler solution to this problem -- one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday It's in its early stages but this is what it looks like right now We call it the Water Canary It's a fast cheap device that answers an important question: Is this water contaminated It doesn't require any special training And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place it uses light That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information To test water you simply insert a sample and within seconds it either displays a red light indicating contaminated water or a green light indicating the sample is safe This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold We're also on top of that integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time With enough users maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action containing hazards before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from And then instead of taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most it can happen automatically We've seen how distributed networks big data and information can transform society I think it's time for us to apply them to water Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation so we can tackle this problem together Thank you A few months ago a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where I live and she was brought in confused Her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170 Within a few minutes she went into cardiac collapse She was resuscitated stabilized whisked over to a CAT scan suite right next to the emergency room because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung but it showed bilateral visible palpable breast masses breast tumors that had metastasized widely all over the body And the real tragedy was if you look through her records she had been seen in four or five other health care institutions in the preceding two years Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses touch the breast mass intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her Ladies and gentlemen that is not an unusual story Unfortunately it happens all the time I joke but I only half joke that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan MRI or orthopedic consult I am not a Luddite I teach at Stanford I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology But I'd like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable early stage but we're losing much more than that We're losing a ritual We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative transcendent and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship This may actually be heresy to say this at TED but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation I think in medicine to come in the next 10 years and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch to comfort to diagnose and to bring about treatment I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Since we're in Edinburgh I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh and his character Sherlock Holmes was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts And Conan Doyle writing about Bell described the following exchange between Bell and his students So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department students all around him patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in And a woman comes in with a child and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange The woman says Good Morning Bell says What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland She says It was good And he says What did you do with the other child She says I left him with my sister at Leith And he says And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row to get here to the infirmary She says I did And he says Would you still be working at the linoleum factory And she says I am And Bell then goes on to explain to the students He says You see when she said 'Good morning，' I picked up her Fife accent And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland And so she must have taken the ferry over You notice that the coat she's carrying is too small for the child who is with her and therefore she started out the journey with two children but dropped one off along the way You notice the clay on the soles of her feet Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh except in the botanical gardens And therefore she took a short cut down Inverleith Row to arrive here And finally she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland And when Bell actually strips the patient begins to examine the patient you can only imagine how much more he would discern And as a teacher of medicine as a student myself I was so inspired by that story But you might not realize that our ability to look into the body in this simple way using our senses is quite recent The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger who in the late 1700s discovered percussion And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper And his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine was left and whether to reorder And so when Auenbrugger became a physician he began to do the same thing He began to tap on the chests of his patients on their abdomens And basically everything we know about percussion which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day -- organ enlargement fluid around the heart fluid in the lungs abdominal changes -- all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript Inventum Novum New Invention which would have disappeared into obscurity except for the fact that this physician Corvisart a famous French physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentleman -- Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work And it was followed a year or two later by Laennec discovering the stethoscope Laennec it is said was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick One was scratching at the end of the stick another child listened at the other end And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called the cylinder Later he renamed it the stethoscope And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born So within a few years in the late 1800s early 1900s all of a sudden the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis If you'll recall prior to that time no matter what ailed you you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you bleeding you purging you And oh yes if you wanted he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides long in the back -- and pull your tooth while he was at it He made no attempt at diagnosis In fact some of you might well know that the barber pole the red and white stripes represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body And this particular painting I think represents the pinnacle the peak of that clinical era This is a very famous painting: The Doctor by Luke Fildes Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate who then established the Tate Gallery And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting of social importance And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic Fildes' oldest son Philip died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness And Fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two three nights that he decided that he would try and depict the physician in our time -- almost a tribute to this physician And hence the painting The Doctor a very famous painting It's been on calendars postage stamps in many different countries I've often wondered what would Fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era in the year 2011 Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer I call it the iPatient The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America The real patient often wonders where is everyone When are they going to come by and explain things to me Who's in charge There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care I want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like when I was in training The focus was around the patient We went from bed to bed The attending physician was in charge Too often these days rounds look very much like this where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient The discussion is all about images on the computer data And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient Now I've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that I want to share with you One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived This is when I was in Texas And she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care And she found the place and decided to go there went there Which is why I was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist And I pressed her and I asked her Why did you come back and get your care here And she was reluctant to tell me She said The cancer center was wonderful It had a beautiful facility giant atrium valet parking a piano that played itself a concierge that took you around from here to there But she said but they did not touch my breasts Now you and I could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts They had her scanned inside out They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level; they had no need to touch her breasts But to her it mattered deeply It was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who every time she went examined both breasts including the axillary tail examined her axilla carefully examined her cervical region her inguinal region did a thorough exam And to her that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed I was very influenced by that anecdote I was also influenced by another experience that I had again when I was in Texas before I moved to Stanford I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy I say that because these are difficult patients They have often been rejected by their families have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who's about to disappoint them And I learned very early on with my first patient that I could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of 45 minutes There was just no way And if I tried I'd disappoint them And so I hit on this method where I invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit and I tried not to interrupt them We know the average American physician interrupts their patient in 14 seconds And if I ever get to heaven it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes and did not interrupt my patient I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence and when the patient came for the physical I was able to do a thorough physical because I had nothing else to do I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam but because the whole visit was now about the physical I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam And I remember my very first patient in that series continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit And I began my ritual I always begin with the pulse then I examine the hands then I look at the nail beds then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node and I was into my ritual And when my ritual began this very voluble patient began to quiet down And I remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and I had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which I had a role and the patient had a role And when I was done the patient said to me with some awe I have never been examined like this before Now if that were true it's a true condemnation of our health care system because they had been seen in other places I then proceeded to tell the patient once the patient was dressed the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions which is This is not in your head This is real The good news it's not cancer it's not tuberculosis it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this but here's what you should do here's what we should do And I would lay out all the standard treatment options that the patient had heard elsewhere And I always felt that if my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness it was because I had earned the right to tell them these things by virtue of the examination Something of importance had transpired in the exchange I took this to my colleagues at Stanford in anthropology and told them the same story And they immediately said to me Well you are describing a classic ritual And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation We marry for example with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss I'm not sure why you're laughing That was the original intent was it not We signal transitions of power with rituals We signal the passage of a life with rituals Rituals are terribly important They're all about transformation Well I would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi and then incredibly on top of that disrobing and allowing touch -- I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance And if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown by not doing a complete exam you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-physician relationship I am a writer and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote that has to do very much with this scene I'm an infectious disease physician and in the early days of HIV before we had our medications I presided over so many scenes like this I remember every time I went to a patient's deathbed whether in the hospital or at home I remember my sense of failure -- the feeling of I don't know what I have to say; I don't know what I can say; I don't know what I'm supposed to do And out of that sense of failure I remember I would always examine the patient I would pull down the eyelids I would look at the tongue I would percuss the chest I would listen to the heart I would feel the abdomen I remember so many patients their names still vivid on my tongue their faces still so clear I remember so many huge hollowed out haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual And then the next day I would come and I would do it again And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient I recall one patient who was at that point no more than a skeleton encased in shrinking skin unable to speak his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth his hands moved as if in slow motion And as I wondered what he was up to his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt fumbling with his buttons I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker-basket chest to me It was an offering an invitation I did not decline I percussed I palpated I listened to the chest I think he surely must have known by then that it was vital for me just as it was necessary for him Neither of us could skip this ritual which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure No this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients Although God knows of late in our hubris we seem to have drifted away We seem to have forgotten -- as though with the explosion of knowledge the whole human genome mapped out at our feet we are lulled into inattention forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician necessary for the patient -- forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient And the message which I didn't fully understand then even as I delivered it and which I understand better now is this: I will always always always be there I will see you through this I will never abandon you I will be with you through the end Thank you very much I'm just going to play a brief video clip On the fifth of December 1985 a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105，000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record The buyer was Kip Forbes son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world the prince of any wine cellar Benjamin Wallace: Now that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock In 1985 he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson 1787 1784 He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building The mystery persisted for about 20 years It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles and he became suspicious And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes But for those 20 years an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world I became increasingly kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know why do people spend these crazy amounts of money not only on wine but on lots of things and are they living a better life than me So I decided to embark on a quest With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes I decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you can imagine This was the first one A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U。S is not the real thing It may come from Wagyu cattle but it's not from the original Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan There are very few places in the U。S where you can try real Kobe and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Cut in Los Angeles I went there and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars And it arrived and it was tiny And I was outraged It was like 160 dollars for this And then I took a bite and I wished that it was tinier because Kobe beef is so rich It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak I almost couldn't finish it I was really happy when I was done Now the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that's why you're going to see this recurring character Which I guess you know communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price White truffles One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world To try this I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto The waiter you know came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said you know Would Signore like the truffles And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma It's not in their taste really It's not in their texture It's in the smell These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles this haunting wonderful nutty mushroomy smell wafted up 10 seconds passed and it was gone And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that you know their purpose had been served and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me There were several -- several of these items were disappointments Yeah The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there They did give me a tour though And this hotel suite is 4，300 square feet It has 360-degree views It has four balconies It was designed by the architect I。M Pei It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from When I took the tour it actually included some Opus One I was glad to see 30，000 dollars for a night in a hotel This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles which have antibacterial properties I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this And it you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today But then again nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you not only did I not get a compliment from any of you I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment should be the test of something's value but I think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that's a reasonable benchmark That said a lot of work goes into these They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times But no compliments Thank you Armando Manni is a former filmmaker who makes this olive oil from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light He uses tiny bottles the glass is tinted he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing and you know gauge its freshness I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils It tasted fine It tasted interesting It was very green it was very peppery But in the blind taste test it came in last The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you'll start to notice I don't play golf so I couldn't actually road test these but I did interview a guy who owns them Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean they'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say look you know you're not getting 57，000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs You're paying for the bling that they're encrusted with gold and platinum The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them so 。。 Oh yeah you know this one This is a coffee made from a very unusual process The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet It's a cat that lives in trees and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations And apparently it's a very picky eater and it you know hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the you know results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form That's right Unrelatedly -- Japan is doing crazy things with toilets There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it There's one with a fragrance dispenser There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor It's almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in This one does not have those bells and whistles but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600 And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer Toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which I used It's fully automated -- you walk towards it and the seat lifts The seat is preheated There's a water jet that cleans you There's an air jet that dries you You get up it flushes by itself The lid closes it self-cleans Not only is it a technological leap forward but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward I mean a no hands no toilet paper toilet And I want to get one of these This was another one I could not get a loaner of Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed There's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it To try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom Lights glaring in off the street and we had to hire a security guard and all these things But anyway we had a great night's sleep And you spend a third of your life in bed I don't think it's that bad of a deal This was a fun one This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company a professional race car driver and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway And you know when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods And it was really amazing It was such a smooth ride Most of the cars that I drive if I get up to 80 they start to rattle I switched lanes on the highway and the driver this chaperone said You know you were just going 110 miles an hour And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it was just that smooth And if I was a billionaire I would get one This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology This is Tom Cruise arriving at the Mission: Impossible III premiere When he tries to open the door you could call it Mission: Impossible IV There was one object that I could not get my hands on and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape And 1947 was a legendary vintage especially in the right bank of Bordeaux And just together that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following But it's 60 years old There's not much of it left What there is of it left you don't know if it's real -- it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist So I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these I'd put out feelers to retailers to auctioneers and it was coming up empty And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai Bipin Desai is a U。C Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said I've got a tasting coming up where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc and 30 vintages of Yquem And it was an invitation you do not refuse I went It was three days four meals And at lunch on Saturday we opened the '47 And you know it had this fragrant softness and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil And then I tasted it and it you know had this kind of unctuous porty richness which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways There were people at my table who thought it was you know fantastic There were some people who were a little less impressed And I wasn't that impressed And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed but I was not the only one there who had that reaction And it wasn't just to that wine Any one of the wines served at this tasting if I'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable But drinking 60 great wines over three days they all just blurred together and it became almost a grueling experience And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech And they gave subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags A lot of people you know said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag Thank you Well that's kind of an obvious statement up there I started with that sentence about 12 years ago and I started in the context of developing countries but you're sitting here from every corner of the world So if you think of a map of your country I think you'll realize that for every country on Earth you could draw little circles to say These are places where good teachers won't go On top of that those are the places from where trouble comes So we have an ironic problem -- good teachers don't want to go to just those places where they're needed the most I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi The children barely went to school they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before and they didn't know what the internet was I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there After this we noticed a couple of interesting things which you'll see But I repeated this all over India and then through a large part of the world and noticed that children will learn to do what they want to learn to do This is the first experiment that we did -- eight year-old boy on your right teaching his student a six year-old girl and he was teaching her how to browse This boy here in the middle of central India -- this is in a Rajasthan village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly They did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time In another South Indian village these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee They downloaded it from Disney。com or one of these websites 14 days after putting the computer in their village So at the end of it we concluded that groups of children can learn to use computers and the internet on their own irrespective of who or where they were At that point I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad India where I gave a group of children -- they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface which you now get free with Windows and asked them to speak into it So when they spoke into it the computer typed out gibberish so they said Well it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying So I said Yeah I'll leave it here for two months Make yourself understood to the computer So the children said How do we do that And I said I don't know actually And I left Two months later -- and this is now documented in the Information Technology for International Development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer In other words they were all speaking like James Tooley So they could do that on their own After that I started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo from the late Arthur C Clarke who said I want to see what's going on And he couldn't travel so I went over there He said two interesting things A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be The second thing he said was that If children have interest then education happens And I was doing that in the field so every time I would watch it and think of him Arthur C Clarke: And they can definitely help people because children quickly learn to navigate the web and find things which interest them And when you've got interest then you have education Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa This is a 15 year-old boy Boy: 。。 just mention I play games like animals and I listen to music SM: And I asked him Do you send emails And he said Yes and they hop across the ocean This is in Cambodia rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game which no child would play inside the classroom or at home They would you know throw it back at you They'd say This is very boring If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away then they will show off with each other about what they can do This is what these children are doing They are trying to multiply I think And all over India at the end of about two years children were beginning to Google their homework As a result the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their English -- rapid improvement and all sorts of things They said They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth And indeed they had I mean if there's stuff on Google why would you need to stuff it into your head So at the end of the next four years I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet to achieve educational objectives on their own At that time a large amount of money had come into Newcastle University to improve schooling in India So Newcastle gave me a call I said I'll do it from Delhi They said There's no way you're going to handle a million pounds-worth of University money sitting in Delhi So in 2006 I bought myself a heavy overcoat and moved to Newcastle I wanted to test the limits of the system The first experiment I did out of Newcastle was actually done in India And I set myself and impossible target: can Tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a South Indian village teach themselves biotechnology in English on their own And I thought I'll test them they'll get a zero -- I'll give the materials I'll come back and test them -- they get another zero I'll go back and say Yes we need teachers for certain things I called in 26 children They all came in there and I told them that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything It's all in English and I'm going So I left them with it I came back after two months and the 26 children marched in looking very very quiet I said Well did you look at any of the stuff They said Yes we did Did you understand anything No nothing So I said Well how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing They said We look at it every day So I said For two months you were looking at stuff you didn't understand So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says literally Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule causes genetic disease we've understood nothing else It took me three years to publish that It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology One of the referees who refereed the paper said It's too good to be true which was not very nice Well one of the girls had taught herself to become the teacher And then that's her over there Remember they don't study English I edited out the last bit when I asked Where is the neuron and she says The neuron The neuron and then she looked and did this Whatever the expression it was not very nice So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances But 30 percent is not a pass So I found that they had a friend a local accountant a young girl and they played football with her I asked that girl Would you teach them enough biotechnology to pass And she said How would I do that I don't know the subject I said No use the method of the grandmother She said What's that I said Well what you've got to do is stand behind them and admire them all the time Just say to them 'That's cool That's fantastic What is that Can you do that again Can you show me some more？' She did that for two months The scores went up to 50 which is what the posh schools of New Delhi with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting So I came back to Newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious So having experimented in all sorts of remote places I came to the most remote place that I could think of Approximately 5，000 miles from Delhi is the little town of Gateshead In Gateshead I took 32 children and I started to fine-tune the method I made them into groups of four I said You make your own groups of four Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers Remember from the Hole in the Wall You can exchange groups You can walk across to another group if you don't like your group etc You can go to another group peer over their shoulders see what they're doing come back to you own group and claim it as your own work And I explained to them that you know a lot of scientific research is done using that method The children enthusiastically got after me and said Now what do you want us to do I gave them six GCSE questions The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes The worst in 45 They used everything that they knew -- news groups Google Wikipedia Ask Jeeves etc The teachers said Is this deep learning I said Well let's try it I'll come back after two months We'll give them a paper test -- no computers no talking to each other etc The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent When I did the experiment when I did the test after two months the score was 76 percent There was photographic recall inside the children I suspect because they're discussing with each other A single child in front of a single computer will not do that I have further results which are almost unbelievable of scores which go up with time Because their teachers say that after the session is over the children continue to Google further Here in Britain I put out a call for British grandmothers after my Kuppam experiment Well you know they're very vigorous people British grandmothers 200 of them volunteered immediately The deal was that they would give me one hour of broadband time sitting in their homes one day in a week So they did that and over the last two years over 600 hours of instruction has happened over Skype using what my students call the granny cloud The granny cloud sits over there I can beam them to whichever school I want to Teacher: You can't catch me You say it You can't catch me Children: You can't catch me Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man Children: I'm the gingerbread man Teacher: Well done Very good 。。 SM: Back at Gateshead a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism in 15 minutes You know stuff which I don't know anything about Two children watch a TEDTalk They wanted to be footballers before After watching eight TEDTalks he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci It's pretty simple stuff This is what I'm building now -- they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments The furniture is designed so that children can sit in front of big powerful screens big broadband connections but in groups If they want they can call the granny cloud This is a SOLE in Newcastle The mediator is from Pune India So how far can we go One last little bit and I'll stop I went to Turin in May I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students I speak only English they speak only Italian so we had no way to communicate I started writing English questions on the blackboard The children looked at it and said What I said Well do it They typed it into Google translated it into Italian went back into Italian Google Fifteen minutes later -- next question: where is Calcutta This one they took only 10 minutes I tried a really hard one then Who was Pythagoras and what did he do There was silence for a while then they said You've spelled it wrong It's Pitagora And then in 20 minutes the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens This sent shivers up my spine These are 10 year-olds Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity And then SM: So you know what's happened I think we've just stumbled across a self-organizing system A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside Self-organizing systems also always show emergence which is that the system starts to do things which it was never designed for Which is why you react the way you do because it looks impossible I think I can make a guess now -- education is self-organizing system where learning is an emergent phenomenon It'll take a few years to prove it experimentally but I'm going to try But in the meanwhile there is a method available One billion children we need 100 million mediators -- there are many more than that on the planet -- 10 million SOLEs 180 billion dollars and 10 years We could change everything Thanks Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners Not being the musicians -- the listeners right And we crave one thing even though we kind of don't know it all the time We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played And we go to live concerts and we get that as much as we can But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded And it turns out the further back you go in history the little rougher it sounds And so we said there's a solution to this Let's separate the performance as a thing out from the recording which was how it was made You know the thing with microphones in the room and all that day But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers and what instruments they were using And it's the data hidden inside the recording In order to do this it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things -- but full of solenoids and fiber optics and computers and all this kind of stuff The highest resolution out of Japan And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition And we were able to cross this line called the uncanny valley in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms We have a process where we you know kind of put it into the computer and digitize it and then a whole lot of analysis And we look at every single note and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck and how they were held down and how you move the fingers So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers And you know it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you but we never had a science behind these kinds of things I'm going to start with Glenn Gould He died 25 years ago this year and was born 75 years ago this year Was a beloved pianist maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century He just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like -- a performing monkey was in fact his term So he stepped back and did nothing but the crafting of his work And Gould's specialty was playing Bach His maybe most famous recording was something called The Goldberg Variations Bach only wrote themes and variations one time He wrote some early pieces but late in his life in his mature period he said Here's a theme -- 30 variations In fact the theme isn't even the melody it's the bass line And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono and one in stereo And the one in mono by the way he used the pedal and as he got older he said No no wait a minute I'm going to get very scientific about this and not use the pedal What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version and we'll play the first couple pieces of it Glenn Gould 1955 How about that So let me tell you a little bit how this was done First of all let me get you to the end step This is -- we have a fairly complex process that you know software and musicians and so on but when we're all done we know that the ear is the final arbiter We can play the original in one ear and a new recording in the other So I'm going to do this for you right now what you just heard And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording and the left speaker is going to be the new recording actually of an instrument just like that one and I'm going to play them together at the same time That's the original Unclear That's the two together Before Jurassic Park there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle right So in the video world we've been able to invent in our lifetimes natural behavior And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior And then you heard the original Ultimately I started with the experience And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians Lots of you can afford to buy one of these But if not there is now high-definition surround sound And I got to tell you if you haven't heard high-definition surround go down to your audio dealer your audiophile dealer It's so involving compared to regular stereo But if you don't have that maybe you can listen on your headphones And so on the same disk we have five recordings -- Sony has five recordings And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument and it's got microphones where the ears are And when you put on headphones and you listen to this you're inside of Glenn Gould's body And it is a chuckle until you know the musicians who are musicians who play the piano listen to this say I can't believe it It's just what it's like to play the piano Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process It's a game changer Here's now something we know in spectacular quality The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity What you heard today was not perfect It's an amalgam of wood and cast iron and felt and steel strings and all these and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity So when you go into the recording session you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to There's the whole action there sitting kind of on the side and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano Without putting dates next to these things step-by-step music will be turned into data like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing and bits and re-mastering I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from which is how it was performed And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool -- they're high-resolution and they're wired straight to our emotions and you can't trick them very easily Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know All right there's this episode of Star Trek I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there The episode of Star Trek for me was James Daly played Methuselah -- remember this one And at some point he's dancing with his -- and I won't ruin the episode for you from 1967 Right do you know where I'm going And Nimoy I'm sorry Spock sits down at the piano and he starts playing this Brahms waltz and they all dance to it And then Spock turns round he goes James I know all of the Brahms waltzes and I don't believe this is one of them in the category That's where I'm at I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play But I believe we're on a path now when we get to data that we can distill styles and templates and formulas and all these kinds of things again that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world It's now coming in this world The transition will be this one It says right now we think music is notes and how they're played And I believe this is coming Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data -- no Glenn Gould in the room But yet it was human And I believe you'll get to the next step the real dream of listeners Every time you listen to a recording today every time you take out your iPod and whatever every time you listen to it it's the same thing -- it's frozen Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened it could be different This morning you're sadder you want to hear your song the same song played sadder than you did yesterday You want to hear it played by different musicians You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever We've seen all these Star Treks and they're all holodeck episodes as well Every time I listen to that I get goose bumps It's so amazing it's so exciting Every time I listen to that recording it's like Oh my God I can't believe I'm in the same room I can't believe this is happening It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to in whatever form And lastly I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum So I've really overshot my budget here We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949 And I've got to tell you we have this lab where we build and measure everything back in Raleigh North Carolina and we flew out to Los Angeles And as the president of the company I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were That's a real uncomfortable feeling when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team and people are going to be sitting there in the audience And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine which has not changed since 1949 still seats 6，000 people And on the sweet spot on the stage Tatum starts playing 。。 and every note every beat every slur every accent every pedal was perfect because he played it for that room on that day And we captured all that data all over again And I want you to hear that right now And fortunately it's right in here This is an encore he used to do It's one minute long It's an Irish jig and I want you to hear his humor And that's just what the live audience did So thank you very much Michael thank you for the opportunity So here we go: a flyby of play It's got to be serious if the New York Times puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play At the bottom of this it says It's deeper than gender Seriously but dangerously fun And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution Not bad except if you look at that cover what's missing You see any adults Well lets go back to the 15th century This is a courtyard in Europe and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play All ages solo play body play games taunting And there it is And I think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard then I think we may have lost something in our culture So I'm gonna take you through what I think is a remarkable sequence North of Churchill Manitoba in October and November there's no ice on Hudson Bay And this polar bear that you see this 1200-pound male he's wild and fairly hungry And Norbert Rosing a German photographer is there on scene making a series of photos of these huskies who are tethered And from out of stage left comes this wild male polar bear with a predatory gaze Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble But on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow wagging her tail And something very unusual happens That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped and ends up with a meal -- changes And this polar bear stands over the husky no claws extended no fangs taking a look And they begin an incredible ballet A play ballet This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear and look a little more closely they're in an altered state They're in a state of play And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us Now how did I get involved in this John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers and I have The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes in retrospect when we studied his tragic mass murder to the importance of play in that that individual by deep study was found to have severe play deprivation Charles Whitman was his name And our committee which consisted of a lot of hard scientists did feel at the end of that study that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated And that finding has stood the test of time -- unfortunately even into more recent times at Virginia Tech And other studies of populations at risk sensitized me to the importance of play but I didn't really understand what it was And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it by any means But there are ways of looking at it that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy a way of thinking about it And this image is for humans the beginning point of play When that mother and infant lock eyes and the infant's old enough to have a social smile what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother And she begins to babble and coo and smile and so does the baby If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram the right brain of each of them becomes attuned so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on And I'd like you to think that every bit of more complex play builds on this base for us humans And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play but it's never just singularly one thing We're going to look at body play which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity This is a mountain goat If you're having a bad day try this: jump up and down wiggle around -- you're going to feel better And you may feel like this character who is also just doing it for its own sake It doesn't have a particular purpose and that's what's great about play If its purpose is more important than the act of doing it it's probably not play And there's a whole other type of play which is object play And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball and he or she's going to roll down a hill And -- they don't throw it at each other but this is a fundamental part of being playful The human hand in manipulation of objects is the hand in search of a brain; the brain is in search of a hand; and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way JPL we heard this morning -- JPL is an incredible place They have located two consultants Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist Nate Johnson is a mechanic He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems And he tried to figure out why And he came to the conclusion quite on his own that the students who could no longer solve problems such as fixing cars hadn't worked with their hands Frank Wilson had written a book called The Hand They got together -- JPL hired them Now JPL NASA and Boeing before they will hire a research and development problem solver -- even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech -- if they haven't fixed cars haven't done stuff with their hands early in life played with their hands they can't problem-solve as well So play is practical and it's very important Now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration But it has to be safe exploration This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy and that's his mom Other situations wouldn't be quite so good But curiosity exploration are part of the play scene If you want to belong you need social play And social play is part of what we're about here today and is a byproduct of the play scene Rough and tumble play These lionesses seen from a distance looked like they were fighting But if you look closely they're kind of like the polar bear and husky: no claws flat fur soft eyes open mouth with no fangs balletic movements curvilinear movements -- all specific to play And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us Preschool kids for example should be allowed to dive hit whistle scream be chaotic and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play Spectator play ritual play -- we're involved in some of that Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare -- where the Red Sox won the World Series But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture and you can get a sense that they're all at play Imaginative play I love this picture because my daughter who's now almost 40 is in this picture but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play And I love this one because it's also what we're about We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story I'm telling you a story today about play Well this bushman I think is talking about the fish that got away that was that long but it's a fundamental part of the play scene So what does play do for the brain Well a lot We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant They'd given me a large grant when I was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers and I thought I had a pretty good track record and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past and the play wave is cresting because there is some good science Nothing lights up the brain like play Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe -- the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed and -- and and and So it's -- for me its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about And this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject but it allows mobility which has limited the actual study of play And we've got a mother-infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does The animal world has objectified it In the animal world if you take rats who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak they wrestle they pin each other that's part of their play If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar they're hardwired to flee and hide Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat So what happens They both hide out The non-players never come out -- they die The players slowly explore the environment and begin again to test things out That says to me at least in rats -- and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do and a similar cortical architecture -- that play may be pretty important for our survival And and and -- there are a lot more animal studies that I could talk about Now this is a consequence of play deprivation This took a long time -- I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT and multiple EEGs but as a couch potato his brain has shrunk And we do know that in domestic animals and others when they're play deprived they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal Now the program says that the opposite of play is not work it's depression And I think if you think about life without play -- no humor no flirtation no movies no games no fantasy and and and Try and imagine a culture or a life adult or otherwise without play And the thing that's so unique about our species is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime And we all have capacity to play signal Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago What's going to follow from that behavior is play And you can trust it The basis of human trust is established through play signals And we begin to lose those signals culturally and otherwise as adults That's a shame I think we've got a lot of learning to do Now Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal facial body gestural You know you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals You may not know this word but it should be your biological first name and last name Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood And we are by physical anthropologists by many many studies the most neotenous the most youthful the most flexible the most plastic of all creatures And therefore the most playful And this gives us a leg up on adaptability Now there is a way of looking at play that I also want to emphasize here which is the play history Your own personal play history is unique and often is not something we think about particularly This is a book written by a consummate player by the name of Kevin Carroll Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances: alcoholic mother absent father inner-city Philadelphia black had to take care of a younger brother Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined he felt something different And so he followed up on it And his life -- the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death -- he become a linguist a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker And he gives play as a transformative force over his entire life Now there's another play history that I think is a work in progress Those of you who remember Al Gore during the first term and then during his successful but unelected run for the presidency may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person at least in public And looking at his history which is common in the press it seems to me at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed Summers were hard hard work in the heat of Tennessee summers He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington D。C And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because I do know something about that -- he wasn't as empowered I think as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history So what I would encourage on an individual level to do is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear joyful playful image that you have whether it's with a toy on a birthday or on a vacation And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now And you'll find you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it Most of us work with groups and I put this up because the d。school the design school at Stanford thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called From Play to Innovation And you'll see this course is to investigate the human state of play which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state and its importance to creative thinking: to explore play behavior its development and its biological basis; to apply those principles through design thinking to promote innovation in the corporate world; and the students will work with real-world partners on design projects with widespread application This is our maiden voyage in this We're about two and a half three months into it and it's really been fun There is our star pupil this labrador who taught a lot of us what a state of play is and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there And Brendan Boyle Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is I think a person who will be in cahoots with George Smoot for a Nobel Prize -- Stuart Thompson in neuroscience So we've had Brendan who's from IDEO and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students as they put play principles into practice in the classroom And one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring and to try and do something about it So what will follow is a student-made film about just that Flow is the mental state of apparition in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing Characterized by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity An important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another disruptive to the day Attendees at meetings don't know when they'll get back to the task that they left at their desk But it doesn't have to be that way Some sage and repeatedly furry monks at this place called the d。school designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over Take the meeting off and have peace of mind that you can come back to me Because when you need it again the meeting is literally hanging in your closet The Wearable Meeting Because when you put it on you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting But when you take it off -- that's when the real action happens Stuart Brown: So I would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute hour by hour with body object social fantasy transformational kinds of play And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life Thank You John Hockenberry: So it sounds to me like what you're saying is that there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work and go -- I think I've heard this in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play that somehow the way animals and humans deal with play is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong SB: Yeah I don't think that's accurate and I think probably because animals have taught us that If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played And if you imagine a kid pretending to be King Kong or a race car driver or a fireman they don't all become race car drivers or firemen you know So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future -- which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as -- and thinking of it as a separate biological entity And this is where my chasing animals for four five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now which is that play has a biological place just like sleep and dreams do And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically animals sleep and dream and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain So it's not just something you do in your spare time JH: How do you keep -- and I know you're part of the scientific research community and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else -- how do you prevent -- How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work kind of like the Mozart metaphor where Oh MRIs show that play enhances your intelligence Well let's round these kids up put them in pens and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action on the data that you're developing SB: Well I think the only way I know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that I have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play So people know that it's there And then you get an fMRI specialist and you get Frank Wilson and you get other kinds of hard scientists including neuroendocrinologists And you get them into a group together focused on play and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously Unfortunately that hasn't been done sufficiently for the National Science Foundation National Institute of Mental Health or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease associated with play And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term -- as learning some of the basic things about public health JH: Stuart Brown thank you very much The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality increasingly grim reality and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology and that's very understandable Now this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population rising towards 10 billion people land that is turning to desert and of course climate change Now there's no question about it at all: we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology But fossil fuels carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert and this happens only when we create too much bare ground There's no other cause And I intend to focus on most of the world's land that is turning to desert But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year On those it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground No matter what you do nature covers it up so quickly And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness and that is where desertification is occurring Fortunately with space technology now we can look at it from space and when we do you can see the proportions fairly well Generally what you see in green is not desertifying and what you see in brown is and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth About two thirds I would guess of the world is desertifying I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling Think of it in terms of drums of water each containing 200 liters Over 1，000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day The next day the land looked like this Where had that water gone Some of it ran off as flooding but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered Now because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter when we damage soils you give off carbon Carbon goes back to the atmosphere Now you're told over and over repeatedly that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi-arid areas of the world and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae leading to increased runoff and evaporation That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock mostly cattle sheep and goats overgrazing the plants leaving the soil bare and giving off methane Almost everybody knows this from nobel laureates to golf caddies or was taught it as I was Now the environments like you see here dusty environments in Africa where I grew up and I loved wildlife and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs Well I have news for you We were once just as certain that the world was flat We were wrong then and we are wrong again And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery When I was a young man a young biologist in Africa I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks Now no sooner this was in the 1950s and no sooner did we remove the hunting drum-beating people to protect the animals than the land began to deteriorate as you see in this park that we formed Now no livestock were involved but suspecting that we had too many elephants now I did the research and I proved we had too many and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain Now that was a terrible decision for me to have to make and it was political dynamite frankly So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research They did They agreed with me and over the following years we shot 40，000 elephants to try to stop the damage And it got worse not better Loving elephants as I do that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life and I will carry that to my grave One good thing did come out of it It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions When I came to the United States I got a shock to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa And there'd been no livestock on this land for over 70 years And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification but I found the opposite as we see on this research station where this grassland that was green in 1961 by 2002 had changed to that situation And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to unknown processes Clearly we have never understood what is causing desertification which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally We have never understood it Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here and I promise you you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter plant litter You have changed the microclimate Now by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world's land you are changing macroclimate But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10，000 years ago Why has it accelerated lately We had no understanding of that What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators Now the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds and the larger the herd the safer the individuals Now large herds dung and urinate all over their own food and they have to keep moving and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil as we see where a herd has passed This picture is a typical seasonal grassland It has just come through four months of rain and it's now going into eight months of dry season And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season Now all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season and if it doesn't the grassland and the soil begin to die Now if it does not decay biologically it shifts to oxidation which is a very slow process and this smothers and kills grasses leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil releasing carbon To prevent that we have traditionally used fire But fire also leaves the soil bare releasing carbon and worse than that burning one hectare of grassland gives off more and more damaging pollutants than 6，000 cars And we are burning in Africa every single year more than one billion hectares of grasslands and almost nobody is talking about it We justify the burning as scientists because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow Now looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry what could we do to keep that healthy And bear in mind I'm talking of most of the world's land now Okay We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change What are we going to do There is only one option I'll repeat to you only one option left to climatologists and scientists and that is to do the unthinkable and to use livestock bunched and moving as a proxy for former herds and predators and mimic nature There is no other alternative left to mankind So let's do that So on this bit of grassland we'll do it but just in the foreground We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature and we've done so and look at that All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung urine and litter or mulch as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain to store carbon and to break down methane And we did that without using fire to damage the soil and the plants are free to grow When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification I was faced with a real dilemma How were we to do it We'd had 10，000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science and that had accelerated desertification as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals and humans over thousands of years had never been able to deal with nature's complexity But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this So rather than reinvent the wheel I began studying other professions to see if anybody had And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing a planning process and that does address all of nature's complexity and our social environmental economic complexity Today we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds plan their grazing to mimic nature and where we have them hold their animals overnight -- we run them in a predator-friendly manner because we have a lot of lands and so on -- and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well Let's look at some results This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year and it's going into the long dry season But as you can see all of that rain almost of all it has evaporated from the soil surface Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended and we have 150，000 people on almost permanent food aid Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day with the same rainfall and look at that Our river is flowing and healthy and clean It's fine The production of grass shrubs trees wildlife everything is now more productive and we have virtually no fear of dry years And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants buffalo giraffe and other animals that we have But before we began our land looked like that This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got Okay Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature This was another site where it had been bare and eroding and at the base of the marked small tree we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil Okay And again watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature And there are fallen trees in there now because the better land is now attracting elephants etc This land in Mexico was in terrible condition and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland and thankfully now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future And look at the amazing change in this one where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature and once more we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers They put 25，000 sheep in one flock really mimicking nature now with planned grazing and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture Ninety-five percent of that land can only feed people from animals I remind you that I am talking about most of the world's land here that controls our fate including the most violent region of the world where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as I believe fossil fuels and maybe more than fossil fuels But worse than that it is causing hunger poverty violence social breakdown and war and as I am talking to you millions of men women and children are suffering and dying And if this continues we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that for illustrative purposes if we do what I am showing you here we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands that I've shown you we can take us back to pre-industrial levels while feeding people I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet for your children and their children and all of humanity Thank you Thank you Thank you Chris Thank you I have and I'm sure everyone here has A) a hundred questions B) wants to hug you I'm just going to ask you one quick question When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals it's desert What do they eat How does that part work How do you start Allan Savory: Well we have done this for a long time and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation where it's 100 percent bare But many years ago we took the worst land in Zimbabwe where I offered a £5 note in a hundred-mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred-mile drive and on that we trebled the stocking rate the number of animals in the first year with no feeding just by the movement mimicking nature and using a sigmoid curve that principle It's a little bit technical to explain here but just that Well I would love to -- I mean this such an interesting and important idea The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk。AS: Wonderful That is an astonishing talk truly an astonishing talk and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way Thank you so much。AS: Well thank you Thank you Thank you Chris I don't know why but I'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the Internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world's population can go online to learn to create and to share And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow A recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online As the parent of a nine-year-old girl that number seems awfully low But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world And increasingly the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy Today what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place; it's not And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen we are like Hansel and Gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods We are leaving our birthdays our places of residence our interests and preferences our relationships our financial histories and on and on it goes Now don't get me wrong I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing In fact when I know the data that's being shared and I'm asked explicitly for my consent I want some sites to understand my habits It helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked that's when the problem arises It's a phenomenon on the Internet today called behavioral tracking and it is very big business In fact there's an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us And when all of that data is held they can do almost whatever they want with it This is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion and it's an experimental browser add-on that you can install in your Firefox browser that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you The red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that I have not navigated to but are following me The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me but I have no idea who they are All of them are connected as you can see to form a picture of me on the Web And this is my profile So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day Now like most of you I actually start my day going online and checking email I then go to a news site look for some headlines And in this particular case I happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and I shared it over a social network Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table and I asked her Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school And she of course naturally as a nine-year-old looked at me and said quizzically What's literacy So I sent her online of course to look it up Now let me stop here We are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me I have navigated to a total of four So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day I go to work I check email I log onto a few more social sites I blog I check more news reports I share some of those news reports I go look at some videos pretty typical day -- in this case actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day as my day winds down look at my profile The red dots have exploded The gray dots have grown exponentially All in all there's over 150 sites that are now tracking my personal information most all of them without my consent I look at this picture and it freaks me out This is nothing I am being stalked across the Web And why is this happening Pretty simple -- it's huge business The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today And as adults we're certainly not alone At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile I installed one for my daughter And on one single Saturday morning over two hours on the Internet here's her Collusion profile This is a nine-year-old girl navigating to principally children's sites I move from this from freaked out to enraged This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate; this is me being a parent Imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement I can tell you there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by We'd take action It may not be good action but we would take action We can't sit idly by here either This is happening today Privacy is not an option and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet Our voices matter and our actions matter even more Today we've launched Collusion You can download it install it in Firefox to see who is tracking you across the Web and following you through the digital woods Going forward all of our voices need to be heard Because what we don't know can actually hurt us Because the memory of the Internet is forever We are being watched It's now time for us to watch the watchers Thank you I like many of you am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities And there are days -- I don't know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when I palpably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life And some days that can even be a little scary But what I'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues if we apply open source collaboration A couple of years ago I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment Now at the time that I was reading this it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wired magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Pollan was making in this article -- was it's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system So I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydroponics to explore growing food in space And you can actually get optimal nutritional yield by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems Now to a vegetable plant my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space But I can offer some natural light and year-round climate control Fast-forward two years later: we now have window farms which are vertical hydroponic platforms for food-growing indoors And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom which periodically sends some of this liquid nutrient solution up to the top which then trickles down through plants' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets -- so there's no dirt involved Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate so a window farm requires a farmer and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm and whether she is going to feed her food organically Back at the time a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing And I really wanted it to be an open project because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Monsanto where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people's food So I decided that instead of creating a product what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co-developers The first few systems that we created they kind of worked We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers all kinds of stuff But the first few systems were these leaky loud power-guzzlers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved So to bring on more co-developers what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs we explained how they worked and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us So actually now on this website we have 18，000 people And we have window farms all over the world What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R&amp;D or research and development But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y or research and develop it yourself So for example Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right but once we did we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments like lots of other window farmers and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low-light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish winters by outfitting them with LED grow lights that they're now making open source and part of the project So window farms have been evolving through a rapid versioning process similar to software And with every open source project the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers So for do-it-yourselfers we provide free very well-tested instructions so that anyone anywhere around the world can build one of these systems for free And there's a patent pending on these systems as well that's held by the community And to fund the project we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don't have time to build their own systems Now within our community a certain culture has appeared In our culture it is better to be a tester who supports someone else's idea than it is to be just the idea guy What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs But I think that Eileen expresses best what we really get out of this which is the actual joy of collaboration So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people maybe we just need to ditch the term consumer and get behind the people who are doing stuff Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs into solar panels and aquaponic systems And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us And we're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now So we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united and to declare that we are all still pioneers Everyone is both a learner and a teacher This is me being inspired by my first tutor my mom and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to 200 students at Stanford University Now the students and I enjoyed the class but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern the teaching technology isn't In fact I use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom Note the textbook the sage on the stage and the sleeping guy in the back Just like today So my co-teacher Sebastian Thrun and I thought there must be a better way We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class but to bring it to anyone in the world for free We announced the class on July 29th and within two weeks 50，000 people had signed up for it And that grew to 160，000 students from 209 countries We were thrilled to have that kind of audience and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet So we got to work We studied what others had done what we could copy and what we could change Benjamin Bloom had showed that one-on-one tutoring works best so that's what we tried to emulate like with me and my mom even though we knew it would be one-on-thousands Here an overhead video camera is recording me as I'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper A student said This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who's explaining something you haven't grasped but are about to And that's exactly what we were aiming for Now from Khan Academy we saw that short 10-minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour-long lecture and put it on the small-format screen We decided to go even shorter and more interactive Our typical video is two minutes sometimes shorter never more than six and then we pause for a quiz question to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring Here I'm explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences and here there's a pause and the student has to reflect understand what's going on and check the right boxes before they can continue Students learn best when they're actively practicing We wanted to engage them to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves We mostly avoid questions like Here's a formula now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two We preferred open-ended questions One student wrote Now I'm seeing Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look And I like that kind of response That's just what we were going for We didn't want students to memorize the formulas; we wanted to change the way they looked at the world And we succeeded Or I should say the students succeeded And it's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education and in doing so we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes Most online classes the videos are always available You can watch them any time you want But if you can do it any time that means you can do it tomorrow and if you can do it tomorrow well you may not ever get around to it So we brought back the innovation of having due dates You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week but at the end of the week you had to get the homework done This motivated the students to keep going and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time so if you went into a discussion forum you could get an answer from a peer within minutes Now I'll show you some of the forums most of which were self-organized by the students themselves From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng we learned the concept of flipping the classroom Students watched the videos on their own and then they come together to discuss them From Eric Mazur I learned about peer instruction that peers can be the best teachers because they're the ones that remember what it's like to not understand Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that Of course we couldn't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums And finally from Teach For America I learned that a class is not primarily about information More important is motivation and determination It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other Now the class ran 10 weeks and in the end about half of the 160，000 students watched at least one video each week and over 20，000 finished all the homework putting in 50 to 100 hours They got this statement of accomplishment So what have we learned Well we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together but there are more ideas to try Sebastian's teaching another class now I'll do one in the fall Stanford Coursera Udacity MITx and others have more classes coming It's a really exciting time But to me the most exciting part of it is the data that we're gathering We're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class billions of interactions altogether and now we can start analyzing that and when we learn from that do experimentations that's when the real revolution will come And you'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students The Better Man I was the better at getting and keeping You were the better at spend and spend; I was the better at grubbing and heaping But who was the better man in the end Yes who was the better man my friend You were the better with lords and ladies I was the better at pillaging Troy; You were the better at kissing the babies I was the better at search and destroy But who was the better man old boy Who was the better man I was the better at improvisation You were the better at spinning the plates; I was the better at procrastination You were the better at quiet debate But who was the better man old mate Who was the better man You were the better at rolling a reefer I was the better at coke and rum; Remember that night on the beach in Ibiza The Maori twins with the tattooed bum But who was the better man old chum Who was the better man Now we come down to it relatives grieving Out in the hall with their crocodile tears; Now that you're out of it now that you're leaving Now that they've sealed your arse and your ears What I've been meaning to tell you for years And years and years and years old friend 。。 Is that you were the better man in the end; You were the better man My friend I wrote this next poem for my mother Every one of us had a mother only one -- probably the most important person in your life if you're lucky enough to know them My mother was certainly the most important in mine Let me try and describe her to you She's 86 years old She's frail White platinum hair Why do they do that Why do old ladies go to those hair shops and make those helmets Bright as a button All the ducks in a row Looks like a much prettier version of Margaret Thatcher but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character I wrote this poem for her These are not my beliefs But my mother has lived by this creed all her life Never Go Back Never go back Never go back Never return to the haunts of your youth Keep to the track to the beaten track; Memory holds all you need of the truth Never look back Never look back Never succumb to the gorgon's stare Keep to the track to the beaten track; No-one is waiting and nothing is there Never go back Never go back Never surrender the future you earned Keep to the track to the beaten track; Never return to the bridges you've burned Never look back Never look back Never retreat to the 'glorious past。' Keep to the track to the beaten track; Treat every day of your life as your last Never go back Never go back Never acknowledge the ghost on the stair Keep to the track to the beaten track; No-one is waiting and nothing is there Now ladies and gentlemen I'm up on me hobbyhorse If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track that would be me stoking the train without a qualm in the world Ladies don't do it Don't do it You think we want you to do it but we don't want you to do it Stop it Tell them to go to hell You bodies are wonderful as they are Just leave them alone To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age Lady lady do not weep What is gone is gone Now sleep Turn your pillow Dry your tears Count thy sheep and not thy years Nothing good can come of this Time rules all my dearest 'Tis but folly to be waging war On one who never lost before Lady this is all in vain Youth can never come again; We have drunk the summer wine None can make a stitch in time Nip and tuck till crack of doom What is foretold in the womb May not be foresworn with gold Nor may time be bought or sold Dearest do I love thee less Do I shrink from thy caress Think you I could cease to care Never was there one so fair Lady lady do not weep -- What is gone is gone Now sleep Lean against me calm your fears Count thy blessings not thy years America ladies and gentlemen has done more for me financially than Britain ever has or ever could have done I was born in Britain as you have probably guessed Even when on its worst behavior I find myself automatically defending the USA from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles playing their Greek card to Roman trumps America is an empire I hope you know that now All empires by definition are bumbling shambolic bullying bureaucratic affairs as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy as they are corrupted by power in their dotage I am no historian ladies and gentlemen But it seems to be that the USA's sins compared to those of many previous empires are of a more moderate if more pervasive kind Let me put this bluntly If Americans are so fat stupid and ignorant my dear friends from Birmingham how come they rule the world Hail to the Gods of America Hail to the Gods of America Hail to the gods of the dream Invictus E Pluribus Unum But which of them reigns supreme Which is America's Jupiter The Brahmins of Capital Hill A sorcerer's profit on Wall Street They eye of a dollar bill Or is it celebrity status The worship of those we hate Or the cult of living forever If only we'd watch our weight What of the titans of media Or Hollywood's siren call What of the temples of justice Whose servants enslave us all What of the Brand and the Label What of the upstart Sport And what of the Constitution That bully of last resort Hail to the God of America Whose power the masses extol -- Convenience rules America; Convenience owns our soul Aye that it does And if you would like to know why I am not a father -- I who by a miracle have 22 godchildren -- the answer is in this poem which upsets me every time I read it Love Came to Visit Me Love came to visit me shy as a fawn But finding me busy she fled with the dawn At 20 the torch of resentment was lit My rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits The flux of its lava cleared all in its path Comrades and enemies fled from its wrath Yet lovers grew wary once novelty waned To lie with a bloody man his terror unfeigned At 30 my powers seemed mighty to me The fruits of my rivals I shook from the tree By guile and by bluster by night and by day I battered and scattered the fools from my way And women grew willing to sham and to bluff Their trinkets and baubles cost little enough From 40 to 50 grown easy and sly I wined them and dined them like pigs in a sty We feasted and reveled and rutted in muck Forgetting our peril forgetting to duck Forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives Grown sick to our stomachs and sick of our lives Love came to visit me shy as a fawn But finding me busy she fled with the dawn Um there are -- I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun in my businesses So poetry came as a complete shock to me ladies and gentlemen A complete shock I was a little ill Okay I was ill Okay I had a life-threatening illness you know I was in a clinic I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know whatever So in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse And from another nurse I begged a pencil pen And I didn't know what else to do So I started to write poetry That was in October of 2000 I'm not an evil man But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman who men fall down you know when she walks in a room But sometimes I try to put myself in that position Not with much success But it's interesting to me I love to write historical verse I love to think what they thought what it was like Because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience although you guys can not only go to the moon you know you're going to totally transform everything Cloning will transform everything Voice navigation will transform everything I don't know You can do anything you want All you guys are so clever and women you can do it all But human nature doesn't change mate My friends human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor -- probably it was my ancestor -- got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal and battered the bastard to death You think we didn't do that Oh we did We killed every single one of them Inch by inch we killed them We hunted them down wherever they were Rivals for meat Rivals for berries We're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room Our natures haven't changed a single iota And they never will Even when we've got off this little planet and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets And I am as bad as you I spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world And at seven o'clock every night I took me some more girls already corrupted I never did anything to anyone that wasn't And I took crack cocaine every single night for seven years It was like Dante's Inferno It was unbelievable One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours And you stay up for 12 It was absolutely unbelievable Twenty-two godchildren I've got What do I say to them I only stopped because I thought if I got caught what would happen to my mother If you're a woman remember that The love of your son can utterly transform anything he does Our Lady in White Pale she was listless; And soft to the touch A generous mistress Whom many loved much Shoulder to shoulder Night after night We hoarded and sold her -- Our Lady in White We breathed but to savor her crystal caress We craved but to favor the hem of her dress We dabbled and babbled Denying our thirsts But always we scrabbled to lie with her first Absent we missed her grew haggard and limp Toyed with her sister or threatened her pimp Came word out of Babel the lady returns And there on the table we took her in turns Sensing the power that tyranny craves There in that hour she made us her slaves Many there were to covet her kiss My shame as a spur I fled the abyss But only just In the northwest corner of the United States right up near the Canadian border there's a little town called Libby Montana and it's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky And in there is a little town called Libby which I visited which feels kind of lonely a little isolated And in Libby Montana there's a rather unusual woman named Gayla Benefield She always felt a little bit of an outsider although she's been there almost all her life a woman of Russian extraction She told me when she went to school she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing Later in life she got a job going house to house reading utility meters -- gas meters electricity meters And she was doing the work in the middle of the day and one thing particularly caught her notice which was in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home middle aged late middle aged and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks It struck her as strange Then a few years later her father died at the age of 59 five days before he was due to receive his pension He'd been a miner She thought he must just have been worn out by the work But then a few years later her mother died and that seemed stranger still because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever In fact Gayla's uncle is still alive to this day and learning how to waltz It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother should die so young It was an anomaly and she kept puzzling over anomalies And as she did other ones came to mind She remembered for example when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital and she had a lot of x-rays and two of them were leg x-rays which made sense but six of them were chest x-rays which didn't She puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents' life trying to understand what she was seeing She thought about her town The town had a vermiculite mine in it Vermiculite was used for soil conditioners to make plants grow faster and better Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts huge amounts of it put under the roof to keep houses warm during the long Montana winters Vermiculite was in the playground It was in the football ground It was in the skating rink What she didn't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite is a very toxic form of asbestos When she figured out the puzzle she started telling everyone she could what had happened what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons But she was really amazed She thought when everybody knows they'll want to do something but actually nobody wanted to know In fact she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling this story to her neighbors to her friends to other people in the community that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker which they proudly displayed on their cars which said Yes I'm from Libby Montana and no I don't have asbestosis But Gayla didn't stop She kept doing research The advent of the Internet definitely helped her She talked to anybody she could She argued and argued and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area and she told him her story and at first of course like everyone he didn't believe her but he went back to Seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right So now she had an ally Nevertheless people still didn't want to know They said things like Well if it were really dangerous someone would have told us If that's really why everyone was dying the doctors would have told us Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said I don't want to be a victim I can't possibly be a victim and anyway every industry has its accidents But still Gayla went on and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town -- 15，000 people -- and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate 80 times higher than anywhere in the United States That was in 2002 and even at that moment no one raised their hand to say Gayla look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing It's lined with vermiculite This wasn't ignorance It was willful blindness Willful blindness is a legal concept which means if there's information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know the law deems that you're willfully blind You have chosen not to know There's a lot of willful blindness around these days You can see willful blindness in banks when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them You could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on but everyone studiously ignored it You can see willful blindness in the Catholic Church where decades of child abuse went ignored You could see willful blindness in the run-up to the Iraq War Willful blindness exists on epic scales like those and it also exists on very small scales in people's families in people's homes and communities and particularly in organizations and institutions Companies that have been studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like Are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise And when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the United States what they find is 85 percent of people say yes Eighty-five percent of people know there's a problem but they won't say anything And when I duplicated the research in Europe asking all the same questions I found exactly the same number Eighty-five percent That's a lot of silence It's a lot of blindness And what's really interesting is that when I go to companies in Switzerland they tell me This is a uniquely Swiss problem And when I go to Germany they say Oh yes this is the German disease And when I go to companies in England they say Oh yeah the British are really bad at this And the truth is this is a human problem We're all under certain circumstances willfully blind What the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear They're afraid of retaliation And some people are blind because they think well seeing anything is just futile Nothing's ever going to change If we make a protest if we protest against the Iraq War nothing changes so why bother Better not to see this stuff at all And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say Well you know the people who do see they're whistleblowers and we all know what happens to them So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says first of all they're all crazy But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is actually they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for and the reason that they speak up the reason they insist on seeing is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy And the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is Well there's no point because you see what happens to them They are crushed Nobody would want to go through something like that And yet when I talk to whistleblowers the recurrent tone that I hear is pride I think of Joe Darby We all remember the photographs of Abu Ghraib which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in Iraq But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby the very obedient good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in And he said You know I'm not the kind of guy to rat people out but some things just cross the line Ignorance is bliss they say but you can't put up with things like this I talked to Steve Bolsin a British doctor who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies And I asked him why he did it and he said Well it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it She came up to me one night and she just said 'Dad you can't let the kids die。' Or I think of Cynthia Thomas a really loyal army daughter and army wife who as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the Iraq War was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal psychological and medical assistance And she said to me she said You know Margaret I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up But I've found myself in this cause and I'll never be the same We all enjoy so many freedoms today hard-won freedoms: the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary; a freedom to vote which women in particular had to fight so hard for; the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it and what whistleblowers do and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have And what they're very prepared to do is recognize that yes this is going to be an argument and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends but I'm going to become very good at this conflict I'm going to take on the naysayers because they'll make my argument better and stronger I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do These are people of immense persistence incredible patience and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent When I went to Libby Montana I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right I sat in a diner and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh uncontaminated soil I took my 12-year-old daughter with me because I really wanted her to meet Gayla And she said Why What's the big deal I said She's not a movie star and she's not a celebrity and she's not an expert and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary She's like you and she's like me She had freedom and she was ready to use it Thank you very much Picture this: It's Monday morning you're at the office you're settling in for the day at work and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall walks right into your cubicle and he steals your chair Doesn't say a word just rolls away with it Doesn't give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there Doesn't acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some work done today You wouldn't stand for it You'd make a stink You'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say Why my chair Okay so now it's Tuesday morning and you're at the office and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar And it's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall and the subject line references some project that you heard a little bit about But there's no agenda There's no information about why you were invited to the meeting And yet you accept the meeting invitation and you go And when this highly unproductive session is over you go back to your desk and you stand at your desk and you say Boy I wish I had those two hours back like I wish I had my chair back Every day we allow our coworkers who are otherwise very very nice people to steal from us And I'm talking about something far more valuable than office furniture I'm talking about time Your time In fact I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS: Mindless Accept Syndrome The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation the minute it pops up in your calendar It's an involuntary reflex ding click bing it's in your calendar Gotta go I'm already late for a meeting Meetings are important right And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise And a well-run meeting can yield really positive actionable results But between globalization and pervasive information technology the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years And we're miserable And we're miserable not because the other guy can't run a good meeting it's because of MAS our Mindless Accept Syndrome which is a self-inflicted wound Actually I have evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic Let me tell you why A couple of years ago I put a video on Youtube and in the video I acted out every terrible conference call you've ever been on It goes on for about five minutes and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings There's the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting There are the participants who have no idea why they're there The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck And everybody leaves very angry It's kind of funny Let's take a quick look Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal As a group we need to decide if bloop bloop Hi who just joined Hi it's Joe I'm working from home today Hi Joe Thanks for joining us today great I was just saying we have a lot of people on the call we'd like to get through so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive right in Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal As a group we need to decide if bloop bloop Hi who just joined No I thought I heard a beep Sound familiar Yeah it sounds familiar to me too A couple of weeks after I put that online 500，000 people in dozens of countries I mean dozens of countries watched this video And three years later it's still getting thousands of views every month It's close to about a million right now And in fact some of the biggest companies in the world companies that you've heard of but I won't name have asked for my permission to use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company And if the numbers there are a million views and it's being used by all these companies aren't enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings there are the many many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up Thousands of people wrote things like OMG that was my day today That was my day every day This is my life One guy wrote It's funny because it's true Eerily sadly depressingly true It made me laugh until I cried And cried And I cried some more This poor guy said My daily life until retirement or death sigh These are real quotes and it's real sad A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day But the truth is we're not powerless at all In fact the cure for MAS is right here in our hands It's right at our fingertips literally It's something that I call ¡No MAS Which if I remember my high school Spanish means something like Enough already make it stop Here's how No MAS works It's very simple First of all the next time you get a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot of information in it at all click the tentative button It's okay you're allowed that's why it's there It's right next to the accept button Or the maybe button or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately Then get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting Tell them you're very excited to support their work ask them what the goal of the meeting is and tell them you're interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal And if we do this often enough and we do it respectfully people might start to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations And you can make more thoughtful decisions about accepting it People might actually start sending out agendas Imagine Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status when they could just do a quick email and get it done with People just might start to change their behavior because you changed yours And they just might bring your chair back too No MAS Thank you I'd like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo who was put to sleep a couple of days ago because he got too old But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh I'm just a'walking my dog singing my song strolling along Yeah it's just me and my dog catching some sun We can't go wrong My life was lonely and blue Yeah I was sad as a sailor I was an angry 'un too Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear and nerves jingle jangled vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up But then I looked in your eyes and I was no more a failure You looked so wacky and wise And I said Lord I'm happy 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog catching some sun We can't go wrong Yeah it's just me and my dog singing our song strolling along 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt and I don't care what the politicians spout If you need a companion why just go out to the pound and find yourself a hound and make that doggie proud 'cause that's what it's all about Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh My life was tragic and sad I was the archetypal loser I was a pageant gone bad And then there was you -- on time and wagging your tail in the cutest mime that you was in jail I said Woof be mine and you gave a wail and then I was no longer alone And I was no more a boozer We'll make the happiest home And I said Lord I'm happy 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog singing my song strolling along Yeah it's just me and my dog catching some sun We can't go wrong 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt and I don't care what the politicians spout If you need a companion why just go out to the pound and find yourself a hound and make that doggie proud 'cause that's what it's all about that's what it's all about that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW that's what it's all about Heh heh heh heh heh Good dog Thank you You all know this story In the summer of 1950 Enrico Fermi the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there and asked them a question: Where is everybody This confused his colleagues obviously because they were sitting right there with him And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them He was talking about the space aliens You see this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell New Mexico And even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all -- -- merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths 。。 Still America had gone saucer-mad even famous scientists who were eating lunch Fermi's reasoning if I may paraphrase badly is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve we should have some evidence of their existence by now And yet to the best of our knowledge we are alone Where is everybody asked Fermi and his colleagues had no answer Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies Sasquatch God the possibility of love -- and thereafter as you know Enrico Fermi ate alone Now I am not a scientist I have never built an atomic pile Although I might argue that technically every pile is atomic However with respect I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider One is that the aliens might be very far away Perhaps I dare say even on other planets The other possibility -- -- is perhaps Enrico Fermi himself was an alien Think about it Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War out of nowhere suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this That he asked for only one thing -- a gift of two healthy sperm whales That's -- that's not true But it is strange And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here For it is given in certain UFO-ology or UFOlogy circles that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia; that they have walked among us in disguise observing us guiding our evolution from ape to man -- if you believe in that sort of thing -- and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids It's a difficult theory to discount I think you'll agree For even in my own life there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now Encounter one: Ocean City New Jersey 1980 This was the summer when the special edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore Within 12 hours I was horribly sunburned just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the sun watching the skies for UFOs What did I see Stars satellites blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk Occasionally kids would come and join me and watch but their necks soon got sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans I was pretty good at the video games I was not very good at the other part so I stayed alone with the cosmos And that's when it happened An elderly couple came walking down the street I would say they were in their late seventies and I would say that they were on a date because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie -- a brown suit And she was wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean I remember for some reason that they were exactly the same height And then they stopped and the man turned to me and said What are you looking for flying saucers You have to admit that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date But what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time as a nine-year-old child -- was that they stopped at all That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child Oh he said little green men And then his girlfriend joined in too There's no such thing as space men she said There's no such thing And then they both laughed Ha ha ha I looked around The street was entirely empty I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean It was as though time had stopped I did not know why they were teasing me I looked into their strangely angry faces and I remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks And what would be behind those rubber masks if they were Giant almond-shaped unblinking eyes Slits for mouths The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun and then he made laser sounds Kew kew kew -- watch out And they turned at once and walked away The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand and found it and left me alone Now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans Maybe it was swamp gas but -- -- I know what I saw Close encounter two: Brookline Massachusetts 1984 I went to see the movie Dune and a girl talked to me Now on its face -- -- this is impossible on its face I realize -- but it is absolutely true It was opening night naturally I went with my friend Tim McGonigal who sat on my left On my right was the girl in question She had long curly black hair a blue jean jacket I remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an Ace bandage and she had crutches She was very tall I would say I was starting high school at the time I would say she was a junior but I had never seen her before She didn't go to my school I didn't know her name and I never will She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother and they were talking about the novel Dune They were both big fans mother and daughter -- very unusual They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms And then it got stranger That's when she turned to me and said Are you looking forward to seeing the movie First of all I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel Dune at that time I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets as I still am But it was also the tone of how she asked the question: apropos of nothing like she didn't even care about the answer as though she just wanted to talk to me I did not know what to say I said Yes I did not even turn my head The movie began I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of Dune in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator which was a kind of giant floating fetus-creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world He had become in his isolation so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them I mean I liked him a lot better than the sandworms The sandworms were fine but your favorite character Please When the movie ended everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible Except for the girl As I walked out her pace slowed Perhaps it was the crutches but it seemed -- -- it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again When I say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee community they call a screen memory: a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her I sure am glad I never saw her again Close encounter three: Philadelphia Pennsylvania 1989 In the mid-to-late '80s the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called Communion in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as lost time where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes or the previous ten hours or the previous ten days And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes This book became naturally an enormous best-seller This image by Ted Joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him And it was so successful that they made it into a movie And in 1989 the way I remember it I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie And the way I remember it the movie featured these details One: Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet Three: there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe Four: this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City Philadelphia Five: all of which is to say they made a movie out of the book Communion and it starred Christopher Walken Does something seem strange about this to you Something odd Something off Something wrong with this picture Think about it Yes The answer is: I had a girlfriend What How did this happen When did this happen I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand in hand and pondering these very same questions And to this day I have no answer for you Close encounter four: the Algarve Portugal 1991 Some years later I and this woman -- we'll call her Catherine Fletcher -- -- went traveling through the south of Portugal together We stayed in old crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers What Did we do this Really Does anyone do this We went to some topless beaches Excuse me No not in my life For what it's worth we went to Sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock and the lead dog bit me on the ass requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot Make of that what you will Our last day in Portugal we were in the district capital of Faro and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time Now Faro is a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explained you would have to take a bus and then a boat And did I want to come with But I was exhausted and dog-bitten and so I said No I remember what she looked like before she left The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders clustering into a kind of a tan A tan we were both tan -- is this true Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result She was smiling She was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen I loved her and then she went out into that strange alien land It took me some time to come to my senses I had my own lost time moment where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day almost dinnertime and she had not come back Nervous I went down to the street to look for her Now I did not speak Portuguese I did not know where the beach was I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991 and the aliens had not given us that technology yet I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes: either Catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel And so I sat down to wait I did not watch the skies but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along And I watched those constellations shift hoping that they would part and I would see her face It was at that moment in that very small town of 30，000 or so that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it And that's when the Liberians came along Five young men -- all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were staying One of them was named Joseph and he asked me what was I doing and I explained And he said Don't worry He was sure that Catherine would be safe But he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me And for the next two hours they all waited with me: taking turns going up to their room coming back telling me jokes distracting me Two hours they gave me a message We are not alone And then in the middle of a sentence at the very birth of twilight I turned and looked down the street The stars aligned and she came back She was smiling She did not understand why I was so worried Neither did the Liberians although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street holding hands An event like this leaves a scar on the memory much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a Portuguese doctor And even now a decade and a half later even now that we are married I look for her still whenever she is not in the room And even though I think you'll agree it is probable that during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone I love her and wait for her still Thank you for your kind attention The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism I'd done well at school Expectations for me were high and I gleefully entered the student life of lectures parties and traffic cone theft Now appearances of course can be deceptive and to an extent this feisty energetic persona of lecture-going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer albeit a very well-crafted and convincing one Underneath I was actually deeply unhappy insecure and fundamentally frightened -- frightened of other people of the future of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me But I was skilled at hiding it and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself and as the first semester ended and the second began there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen I was leaving a seminar when it started humming to myself fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe She is leaving the room I looked around and there was no one there but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable Shaken I left my books on the stairs and hurried home and there it was again She is opening the door This was the beginning The voice had arrived And the voice persisted days and then weeks of it on and on narrating everything I did in the third person She is going to the library She is going to a lecture It was neutral impassive and even after a while strangely companionate and reassuring although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion So for example if I was angry and had to hide it which I often did being very adept at concealing how I really felt then the voice would sound frustrated Otherwise it was neither sinister nor disturbing although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible Now it was then that I made a fatal mistake in that I told a friend about the voice and she was horrified A subtle conditioning process had begun the implication that normal people don't hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong Such fear and mistrust was infectious Suddenly the voice didn't seem quite so benign anymore and when she insisted that I seek medical attention I duly complied and which proved to be mistake number two I spent some time telling the college G。P about what I perceived to be the real problem: anxiety low self-worth fears about the future and was met with bored indifference until I mentioned the voice upon which he dropped his pen swung round and began to question me with a show of real interest And to be fair I was desperate for interest and help and I began to tell him about my strange commentator And I always wish at this point the voice had said She is digging her own grave I was referred to a psychiatrist who likewise took a grim view of the voice's presence subsequently interpreting everything I said through a lens of latent insanity For example I was part of a student TV station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus and during an appointment which was running very late I said I'm sorry doctor I've got to go I'm reading the news at six Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me A hospital admission followed the first of many a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next and then worst of all a toxic tormenting sense of hopelessness humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom my fear and resistance towards it intensified Now essentially this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind a kind of psychic civil war and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing Helplessly and hopelessly I began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions They told me for example that if I proved myself worthy of their help then they could change my life back to how it had been and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set a kind of labor of Hercules It started off quite small for example pull out three strands of hair but gradually it grew more extreme culminating in commands to harm myself and a particularly dramatic instruction: You see that tutor over there You see that glass of water Well you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students Which I actually did and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty In effect a vicious cycle of fear avoidance mistrust and misunderstanding had been established and this was a battle in which I felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation Two years later and the deterioration was dramatic By now I had the whole frenzied repertoire: terrifying voices grotesque visions bizarre intractable delusions My mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination verbal abuse and physical and sexual assault and I'd been told by my psychiatrist Eleanor you'd be better off with cancer because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia I'd been diagnosed drugged and discarded and was by now so tormented by the voices that I attempted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out Now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years it seems to me now as if someone died in that place and yet someone else was saved A broken and haunted person began that journey but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person I was destined to be Many people have harmed me in my life and I remember them all but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who've helped me The fellow survivors the fellow voice-hearers the comrades and collaborators; the mother who never gave up on me who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took; the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family Don't give up hope I believe that Eleanor can get through this Sometimes you know it snows as late as May but summer always comes eventually Fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized lonely place But together they forged a blend of courage creativity integrity and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole I used to say that these people saved me but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself and crucially they helped me to understand something which I'd always suspected: that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events particularly childhood events and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems Now at first this was very difficult to believe not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing so in this respect a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what I'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth So for example voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world rather than an actual objective danger Now at first I would have believed them I remember for example sitting up one night on guard outside my parents' room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from the voices Because I'd had such a bad problem with self-injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden so I ended up arming myself with a plastic fork kind of like picnic ware and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen It was like Don't mess with me I've got a plastic fork don't you know Strategic But a later response and much more useful would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words so when the voices warned me not to leave the house then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt -- because if I was aware of it then I could do something positive about it -- but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore I would set boundaries for the voices and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another Throughout all of this what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve memories of sexual trauma and abuse of anger shame guilt low self-worth The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly and as such it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my shattered self each fragment represented by a different voice gradually withdraw from all my medication and return to psychiatry only this time from the other side Ten years after the voice first came I finally graduated this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given and one year later the highest masters which shall we say isn't bad for a madwoman In fact one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam which technically possibly counts as cheating And to be honest sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well As Oscar Wilde has said the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about It also makes you very good at eavesdropping because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously So it's not all bad I worked in mental health services I spoke at conferences I published book chapters and academic articles and I argued and continue to do so the relevance of the following concept: that an important question in psychiatry shouldn't be what's wrong with you but rather what's happened to you And all the while I listened to my voices with whom I'd finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion acceptance and respect towards myself And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices and becoming fully aware for the very first time that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr Sandra Escher which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy a sane reaction to insane circumstances not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured but a complex significant and meaningful experience to be explored Together we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing supports the needs of individuals who hear voices and which values them as full citizens This type of society is not only possible it's already on its way To paraphrase Chavez once social change begins it cannot be reversed You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore For me the achievements of the Hearing Voices Movement are a reminder that empathy fellowship justice and respect are more than words; they are convictions and beliefs and that beliefs can change the world In the last 20 years the Hearing Voices Movement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents working together to promote dignity solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress to create a new language and practice of hope which at its very center lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual As Peter Levine has said the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity In this respect for members of society there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone to bear witness to reach out a hand to share the burden of someone's suffering and to hold the hope for their recovery And likewise for survivors of distress and adversity that we remember we don't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us We are unique We are irreplaceable What lies within us can never be truly colonized contorted or taken away The light never goes out As a very wonderful doctor once said to me Don't tell me what other people have told you about yourself Tell me about you Thank you Thank you Hi everybody Ban-gap-seum-ni-da I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life I might look successful and happy being in front of you today but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair The violin which meant everything to me became a grave burden on me Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me their words sounded like meaningless noise When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering I started to rediscover the true power of music In the midst of hardship it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist Do you feel like you are all alone I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart as it did for me Thank you Now I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries My audience is anyone who is here to listen even those who are not familiar with classical music I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center but also hospitals churches prisons and restricted facilities for leprosy patients just to mention a few Now with my last piece I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun exciting and that it can rock you Let me introduce you to my brand new project Baroque in Rock which became a golden disc most recently It's such an honor for me I think while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined But it's now your turn Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world Just play your life with all you have and share it with the world I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you TEDsters Play your life and stay tuned Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country -- I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor And I came from a very privileged background I was very lucky My family was wealthy and my father believed in one thing and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris And he was a clever man He sort of said Well that's OK but you've done very well in your math SATs In fact I'd got an 800 And he thought I did very well -- and I did too -- in the arts: this was my passion And he said If you go to MIT to which I had been given early admission I will pay for every year you're at MIT in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want -- I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris And I thought that was the best deal in town so I accepted it immediately And I decided that if I was good in art and I was good in mathematics I'd study architecture which was the blending of the two I went and told my headmaster that at prep school And I said to him what I was doing that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together He said to me something that just went completely over my head He said You know I like grey suits and I like pin-striped suits but I don't like grey pin-striped suits And I thought What a turkey this guy is and I went off to MIT I studied architecture then did a second degree in architecture and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture That really the mixing of art and science was computers and that that really was the place to bring both and enjoyed a career doing that And probably if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative And after doing this for a long time and the Media Lab passing the baton on I thought Well maybe it's time for me to do a project Something that would be important but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had And in the case of the Media Lab knowing a lot of people knowing people who were either executives or wealthy and also not having in my own case a career to worry about anymore My career I mean I'd done my career Didn't have to worry about earning money Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me And I said Boy let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features and thought that if we could address education by leveraging the children and bringing to the world the access of the computers that that was really the thing we should do Never shown this picture before and probably going to be sued for it It's taken at three o'clock in the morning without the permission of the company It's about two weeks old There they are folks If you look at the picture you'll see they're stacked up Those are conveyor belts that go around This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by but then you'll see the ones up above What happens is they burn into flash memory the software and then test them for a few hours But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line because it's constant So they go around in this loop which is why you see them up there So this was great for us because it was a real turning point But it goes back This picture was taken in 1982 just before the IBM PC was even announced Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here And when people tell me Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids I say to myself What planet do you come from Okay there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it OK We all need help even those of us who are very seasoned This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago Seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 and then basically presented it in 1970 -- April 11 to be precise -- called Teaching Children Thinking What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently and when they debug the programs they come the closest to learning about learning That was very important and in some sense we've lost that Kids don't program enough and boy if there's anything I hope this brings back it's programming to kids It's really important Using applications is OK but programming is absolutely fundamental This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak Logo and a third that I've never even seen before The point being this is going to be very very intensive on the programming side This photograph is very important because it's much later This is in the early 2000s My son Dimitri -- who's here many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the Internet And these kids had their laptops But it was really what spirited this plus the influence of Joe and others We started One Laptop per Child This is the same village in Cambodia just a couple of months ago These kids are real pros There were just 7，000 machines out there being tested by kids Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit but they were all wrong And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold There are many reasons but the two that merit the little bit of time is: one the clarity of purpose is there The moral purpose is clear I can see any head of state any executive I want at any time because I'm not selling laptops OK I have no shareholders Whether we sell it doesn't make any difference whatsoever The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical And the second is very counterintuitive -- you can get the best people in the world If you look at our professional services including search firms including communications including legal services including banking they're all pro bono And it's not to save money We've got money in the bank It's because you get the best people You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission and they're the best people We couldn't afford to hire a CFO We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary and we had a queue of people It allows you to team up with people The U。N。's not going to be our partner if we're profit making So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important and the U。N allowed us to basically reach all the countries And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar And while this machine in some sense is silly in retrospect it actually served a very important purpose That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank It's different It was getting its power in a different way It's kind of childlike Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board by the way In spite of what some people in the press don't get it didn't understand it we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want You want a separate thing like the AC adaptor I didn't bring one with me but they really work much better off-board And then I could tell you lots about the laptop but I decided on just four things Just keep in mind -- because there are other people including Bill Gates who said Gee you've got a real computer That computer is unlike anything you've had and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to And it's very important to be low power and I hope that's picked up more by the industry That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight and the more sunlight the better And that was really critical The mesh network it'll become commonplace And of course rugged goes without saying And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school And by the way when I graduated from MIT I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years So I didn't do that But design matters for a number of reasons The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design cheap labor cheap components and making a cheap laptop And in English the word cheap has a double meaning which is really appropriate because it's cheap in the pejorative sense as well as inexpensive But if you take a different approach and you think of very large-scale integration very advanced materials very advanced manufacturing -- so you're pouring chemicals in one end iPods are spewing out the other -- and really cool design that's what we wanted to do And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes These are his slides and so I don't have to talk about them But it was really to us very important as a strategy It wasn't just to kind of make it cute because somebody -- you know good design is very important Yves showed one of the power-generating devices The mesh network the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world they're connected There's not just laptops And so we have to drop in satellite dishes We put in generators It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these These can talk to each other If you're in a desert they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart If you're in the jungle it's about 500 meters So if a kid bicycles home or walks a few miles they're going to be off the grid so to speak They're not going to be near another laptop so you have to nail these onto a tree and sort of get it You don't call Verizon or Sprint You build your own network And that's very important the user interface We are launching with 18 keyboards English is by far the minority Latin is relatively rare too You just look at some of the languages I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before Is there anybody in the room one person unless you work with OLPC is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen There's only one hand -- so you get it Yes you're right He's right It's Amharic it's Ethiopian In Ethiopia there's never been a keyboard There is no keyboard standard because there's no market And this is the big difference Again when you're a nonprofit you look at children as a mission not as a market So we went to Ethiopia and we helped them make a keyboard And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out And we changed strategy completely I decided at the beginning -- it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries Big countries one of them is not so big but it's rich Here's the six We went to the six and in each case the head of state said he would do it he'd do a million In the case of Gaddafi he'd do 1。2 million and that they would launch it We thought this is exactly the right strategy get it out and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries And so I went to each of those countries at least six times met with the head of state probably two or three times In each case got the ministers went through a lot of the stuff This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year Not something you'd envy or want to do In the case of Libya it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent The camel smells were unbelievable And it was 45 degrees C I mean this was not what you'd call a cool experience And former countries -- I say former because none of them really came through this summer -- there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity make a press release So we went to smaller ones Uruguay bless their hearts Small country not so rich President said he'd do it and guess what He did do it The tender had nothing in it that related to us nothing specific about sunlight-readable mesh-network low-power but just a vanilla laptop proposal And guess what We won it hands down When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay the first 100，000 boom went to OLPC The next day -- the next day not even 24 hours had passed -- in Peru the president of Peru said We'll do 250 And boom a little domino effect The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it The president of Ethiopia said he would do it And boom boom boom The president of Mongolia And so what happens is these things start to happen with these countries -- still not enough Add up all those countries it didn't quite get to thing so we said Let's start a program in the United States So end of August early September we decide to do this We announced it near the middle end -- just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place We thought that was a good time to announce it Launched it on the 12 of November We said it would be just for a short period until the 26 We've extended it until the 31 And the Give One Get One program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested The first day it was just wild And then we said Well let's get people to give many Not just one and get one but maybe give 100 give 1，000 And that's where you come in And that's where I think it's very important I don't want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of laptops Okay Do it but that's not going to help Okay If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars whatever it is 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah great I want you do something else And it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1，000 though I invite you to do that and 10，000 would be even better Tell people about it It's got to become viral OK Use your mailing lists People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists Get your friends to give one get one And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people that would be fantastic I won't dwell on the pricing at all Just to say that when you do the Give One Get One a lot of press is a bit about They didn't make it it's 188 dollars it's not 100 It will be 100 in two years It will go below 100 We've pledged not to add features but to bring that price down But it was the countries that wanted it to go up and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons So what you can do -- I've just said it Don't just give one get one I just want to end with one last one This one is not even 24-hours old or maybe it's 24-hours The first kids got their laptops They got them by ship and I'm talking now about 7，000 8，000 at a time went out this week They went to Uruguay Peru Mexico And it's been slow coming and we're only making about 5，000 a week but we hope we hope sometime in next year maybe by the middle of the year to hit a million a month Now put that number and a million isn't so much It's not a big number We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number And the world production today everybody combined making laptops is five million a month So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year we're going to make 20 percent of the world production And if we do that there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there And we hope if you have EG two years from now or whenever you have it again I won't have bad breath and I will be invited back and will have hopefully by then maybe 100 million out there to children Thank you We are losing our listening We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening but we're not very good at it We retain just 25 percent of what we hear Now not you not this talk but that is generally true Let's define listening as making meaning from sound It's a mental process and it's a process of extraction We use some pretty cool techniques to do this One of them is pattern recognition So in a cocktail party like this if I say David Sara pay attention some of you just sat up We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially our name Differencing is another technique we use If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes you would literally cease to hear it We listen to differences we discount sounds that remain the same And then there is a whole range of filters These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters But they actually create our reality in a way because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now Give you one example of that: Intention is very important in sound in listening When I married my wife I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis But it's a great intention to have in a relationship But that's not all Sound places us in space and in time If you close your eyes right now in this room you're aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces And you're aware of how many people are around you because of the micro-noises you're receiving And sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it In fact I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future So Sonority is time and meaning -- a great quote I said at the beginning we're losing our listening Why did I say that Well there are a lot of reasons for this First of all we invented ways of recording -- first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared Secondly the world is now so noisy with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily it's just hard to listen; it's tiring to listen Many people take refuge in headphones but they turn big public spaces like this shared soundscapes into millions of tiny little personal sound bubbles In this scenario nobody's listening to anybody We're becoming impatient We don't want oratory anymore we want sound bites And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously I think -- by personal broadcasting I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common especially in the U。K We're becoming desensitized Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention And that means it's harder for us to pay attention to the quiet the subtle the understated This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening This is not trivial Because listening is our access to understanding Conscious listening always creates understanding And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening Would you like that Good The first one is silence Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again If you can't get absolute silence go for quiet that's absolutely fine Second I call this the mixer So even if you're in a noisy environment like this -- and we all spend a lot of time in places like this -- listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to You can do it in a beautiful place as well like in a lake How many birds am I hearing Where are they Where are those ripples It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening Third this exercise I call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise It's about enjoying mundane sounds This for example is my tumble dryer It's a waltz One two three One two three One two three I love it Or just try this one on for size Wow So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention I call that the hidden choir It's around us all the time The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing away This is listening positions -- the idea that you can move your listening position to what's appropriate to what you're listening to This is playing with those filters Do you remember I gave you those filters at the beginning It's starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places These are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use There are many Have fun with that It's very exciting And finally an acronym You can use this in listening in communication If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence And RASA stands for Receive which means pay attention to the person; Appreciate making little noises like hmm oh okay; Summarize the word so is very important in communication; and Ask ask questions afterward Now sound is my passion it's my life I wrote a whole book about it So I live to listen That's too much to ask from most people But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill Why is it not taught It's crazy And if we can teach listening in our schools we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it Now I don't know how to do that but this is TED and I think the TED community is capable of anything So I invite you to connect with me connect with each other take this mission out and let's get listening taught in schools and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world -- a world of connection a world of understanding and a world of peace Thank you for listening to me today I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder: I find no peace and all my war is done; I fear and hope I burn and freeze like ice; I fly above the wind and yet I cannot arise; And naught I have and all the world I seize upon I want what I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back Gone with the last train honey don't you fret Every cloud has a silver lining Just a little rain just a little rain just a little rain I want what I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have My mind won't stop and my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me My mind won't stop and my heart says Good things come to those who wait And I can't stand in 。。 I can't stand in line forever Stand the cold air Glad-handed Sick and tired of the Later maybe Take it fake it take it take-it-or-leave-it life And I gotta just tame it I gotta just name it I gotta just seize so please oh please oh please oh please Oh please me right 'cause My mind won't stop And my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo 。。 Good things must be here -- yes right here Here right here right here I won't live this life forever One time round is all the offer is Sick and tired of the Later maybe Take it fake it make it leave it life And I gotta just name it I gotta just claim it I gotta just seize Oh please oh please oh please me right I want what I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have -- you know that My mind won't stop and my heart says go Nobody knows how to hold me no My mind won't stop and my heart says go 'Cause I want what I can't have need what I can't want Have but I -- have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have what I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have what I want What I can't have need what I can't want Have but I don't have what I want It's Monday morning In Washington the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen At Number 10 Downing Street David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession In Madrid Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said You must make him drink today -- my father's been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether by giving him this bottle I might actually kill him We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions We talk things over with our friends we scour the Internet we search through books But still even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends it's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do But I believe that this is a big problem a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society as a culture and as individuals It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world -- of course they have The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts We've become addicted to their certainty their assuredness their definitiveness and in the process we have ceded our responsibility substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom We've surrendered our power trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide This is no exaggeration In a recent experiment a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak The results were quite extraordinary As they listened to the experts' voices the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off It literally flat-lined And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice however right or wrong But experts do get things wrong Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of 10 Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you And then there's of course the example that we're all too aware of: financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s For the sake of our health our wealth and our collective security it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on And I'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why but also -- and I'm aware of the irony here -- as an expert myself as a professor as somebody who advises prime ministers heads of big companies international organizations but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change that we need to become more open-minded more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from let me bring you into my world the world of experts Now there are of course exceptions wonderful civilization-enhancing exceptions But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds often hero-worshipping their own gurus Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on not challenged by his peers until after the crisis of course You see we also learn that experts are located are governed by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in Victorian England say who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire or the psychiatrists in the United States who up until 1973 were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks -- because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies of their new products massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study And we've also got to be aware that experts of course also make mistakes They make mistakes every single day -- mistakes born out of carelessness A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries operating on the wrong side of the brain carrying out procedures on the wrong hand elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors A common thinking error of radiologists for example -- when they look at CT scans -- is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia say what happens is that if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan they literally stop looking at it -- thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts These are of course not the only insights I could share but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on But how can we do this Well for the sake of time I want to focus on just three strategies First we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles This doesn't mean having to get a Ph。D in every single subject you'll be relieved to hear But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when for example we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand Why was it that when I had an operation my doctor said to me Beware Ms Hertz of hyperpyrexia when he could have just as easily said Watch out for a high fever You see being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like: What are the assumptions that underpin this What is the evidence upon which this is based What has your investigation focused on And what has it ignored It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first primarily on male animals and then primarily on men It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed Second we need to create the space for what I call managed dissent If we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out in which we're bringing in new diverse discordant heretical views into the discussion fearlessly in the knowledge that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent discordant heretical views All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy In meetings he looks out for the person in the room -- arms crossed looking a bit bemused -- and draws them into the discussion trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion so that they have dissent within the room Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement discord and difference But we need to go even further We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees fancy titles diplomas best-selling books -- high-status individuals But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's but also shop-girls -- yeah Best Buy the consumer electronics company gets all its employees -- the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office not just its forecasting team -- to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on time By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company Best Buy was able to discover for example that the store that it was going to open in China -- its big grand store -- was not going to open on time Because when it asked its staff all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening It turned out that they were aware as no one else within the company was of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground in China were even aware of The strategies that I have discussed this evening -- embracing dissent taking experts on democratizing expertise rebellious strategies -- are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing complex difficult times For if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on if we challenge experts if we're skeptical if we devolve authority if we are rebellious but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance uncertainty and doubt and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century For now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following blindly accepting blindly trusting Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open -- yes using experts to help us figure things out for sure -- I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here -- but being aware of their limitations and of course also our own Thank you What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter and actually all the way down into the sewer because I want to talk about diarrhea And in particular I want to talk about the design of diarrhea And when evolutionary biologists talk about design they really mean design by natural selection And that brings me to the title of the talk Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this But I'm not just doing this to be cute I really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me who's sort of a Darwin wannabe how they actually look at one's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists You actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and may actually be very resistant when one tries to introduce ideas So all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions One is that why are some disease organisms more harmful And a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question How can we make the harmful organisms more mild And I'm going to be talking to begin with as I said about diarrheal disease organisms And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view germ's-eye view And in particular to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host But not always Sometimes you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission And when you have that then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative more predator-like organisms So natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms So if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners So I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact person-to-food-then-to-person contact when somebody eats contaminated food or they can be transmitted through the water And when they're transmitted through the water unlike the first two modes of transmission these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens even hundreds of other individuals To sort of illustrate that this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials They're going to wash those contaminated materials and then the water may move into sources of drinking water People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals And so the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water we expect them to be more predator-like more harmful And you can test these ideas So one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful And the answer is -- yep they are Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs but the main point here is that -- there's a lot of them here I can tell -- the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong positive association between the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water and how harmful they are how much death they cause per untreated infection So this suggests we're on the right track But this to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild Now this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph But it doesn't tell you how long I mean if this would require thousands of years then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens But if it could occur in just a few years then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control In other words this suggests that we could domesticate these organisms We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us And so as I was thinking about this I focused on this organism which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful It's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes the only way it can which is out the other end And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios So what happens if you've got an organism it produces a lot of toxin After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine It's sort of cloudy water And if you took a drop of that water you might find a million diarrheal organisms If the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find 10 million or 100 million If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin then you might find a smaller number So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission Now I can think of some possible experiments One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries Some countries that might have clean water supplies so that you can't get waterborne transmission: you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there Other countries in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right There's a little ethical problem in this experiment I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least That makes me worry a little bit But anyhow the laughter makes me feel a little bit better And this ethical problem's a big problem Just to emphasize this this is what we're really talking about Here's a girl who's almost dead She got rehydration therapy she perked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person So we don't want to run an experiment like that But interestingly just that thing happened in 1991 In 1991 this cholera organism got into Lima Peru and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas Now I don't know how that happened and I didn't have anything to do with it I promise you I don't think anybody knows but I'm not averse to once that's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that I did make before actually holds up Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile which has some of the most well protected water supplies in Latin America And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador which has some of the least well protected And Peru's got something sort of in between And so with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation I got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru you had strains entering Chile -- and when you look at those strains in the very far left-hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in the toxin production Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person -- a lot of variation on which natural selection can act But the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild They evolved to produce less toxin And to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in 1995 we find that there's only one case of cholera on average reported from Chile every two years So it's controlled That's how much we have in America cholera that's acquired endemically and we don't think we've got a problem here They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile But before we get too confident we'd better look at some of those other countries and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness Well in Peru it didn't And in Ecuador -- remember this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission -- it looked like it got more harmful In every case there's a lot of variation but something about the environment the people are living in and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's the degree of waterborne transmission favored the harmful strains in one place and mild strains in another So this is very encouraging it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow if we had enough money could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck It would make these organisms evolve to mildness so that even though people might be getting infected they'd be infected with mild strains It wouldn't be causing severe disease But there's another really interesting aspect of this and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence evolution of harmfulness then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance And the idea is very simple If you've got a harmful organism a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance And once you get increased antibiotic resistance the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore So you've got a higher level of virulence So you get this vicious cycle The goal is to turn this around If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance So we can go to the same countries and look and see Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem If we look in the beginning of the 1990s we see again a lot of variation In this case on the Y-axis we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity -- and I won't go into that But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile Peru and Ecuador and no trend across the years But if we look at the end of the 1990s just half a decade later we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem Antibiotic sensitivity was going down And in Chile you still had antibiotic sensitivity So it looks like Chile dodged two bullets They got the organism to evolve to mildness and they got no development of antibiotic resistance Now these ideas should apply across the board as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence And I want to give you just one more example because we've talked a little bit about malaria And the example I want to deal with is or the idea I want to deal with the question is what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness Now malaria's transmitted by a mosquito and normally if you're infected with malaria and you're feeling sick it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you And you can show just by looking at data from literature that vector-borne diseases are more harmful than non-vector-borne diseases But I think there's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this In the case of waterborne transmission we'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness In the case of malaria what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses And the logic's a little more subtle here If you mosquito-proof houses when people get sick they're sitting in bed -- or in mosquito-proof hospitals they're sitting in a hospital bed -- and the mosquitoes can't get to them So if you're a harmful variant in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing then you're a loser The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites So if you were to mosquito proof houses you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama Just to give you a little perspective on this I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States which is right there in Louisville Kentucky And this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there in Northern Alabama by the Tennessee Valley Authority They had dammed up the Tennessee River They'd caused the water to back up they needed electric hydroelectric power And when you get stagnant water you get mosquitoes They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams -- that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria about a third to half of them were infected with malaria This shows you the positions of some of these dams OK so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind There wasn't DDT there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do Well they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama So they did They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones and within three years about 100 dollars per house they mosquito proofed every house And these are the data Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones And the asterisks represent the time at which the mosquito proofing was complete And so what you can see is that just the mosquito-proofed housing and nothing else caused the eradication of malaria And this was incidentally published in 1949 in the leading textbook of malaria called Boyd's Malariology But almost no malaria experts even know it exists This is important because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses Now I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places Like you know just as you get into the malaria zone sub-Saharan Africa But as you move to really intense biting rate areas like Nigeria you're certainly not going to eradicate But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness So to me it's an experiment that's waiting to happen and if it confirms the prediction then we should have a very powerful tool In a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at because most of what's being done today is to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs And we know that although it's great to make those anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency we know that when you make them highly available you're going to get resistance to those drugs And so it's a short-term solution This is a long-term solution What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution working in the direction we want it to go rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen for example with anti-malarial drugs So this table I've given just to emphasize that I've only talked about two examples But as I said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases we're dealing with living systems We're dealing with living systems; we're dealing with systems that evolve And so if you do something with those systems they're going to evolve one way or another And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go So I don't really have time to talk about those things but I did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about So for example earlier today there was discussion of how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners and so on But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus And the data really do support this: that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts So the other thing I really like about this besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want that it indicates should be done are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow But people just haven't been able to justify the cost So this is the kind of thing I'm talking about If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water then I think that we can say let's push the effort into that aspect of the control so that we can actually solve the problem even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply Anyhow I'll end that there and thank you very much I am very very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses I am very happy and honored to be amidst very very innovative and intelligent people I have listened to the three previous speakers and guess what happened Every single thing I planned to say they have said it here and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something that bud is a young one So I will -- since I am not young and am very old I still will say something We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment because another conference is taking place in Berlin It is the G8 Summit The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid something akin to the Marshall Plan Unfortunately I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan One because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated Its largest recipients were Germany and France and it was only 2。5 percent of their GDP An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 15 percent of its GDP and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect How the media covers Africa in the West and the consequences of that By displaying despair helplessness and hopelessness the media is telling the truth about Africa and nothing but the truth However the media is not telling us the whole truth Because despair civil war hunger and famine although they're part and parcel of our African reality they are not the only reality And secondly they are the smallest reality Africa has 53 nations We have civil wars only in six countries which means that the media are covering only six countries Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience But the effect of that presentation is it appeals to sympathy It appeals to pity It appeals to something called charity And as a consequence the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair What should we do with it We should give food to the hungry We should deliver medicines to those who are ill We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war And in the process Africa has been stripped of self-initiative I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses But equally it has opportunities and a lot of potential We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa from a challenge of despair which is called poverty reduction to a challenge of hope We frame it as a challenge of hope and that is worth creation The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty It should be a challenge of creating wealth Once we change those two things -- if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent with what Medicines for the poor food relief for those who are hungry and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war And in the process none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ladies and gentlemen does not create wealth for them Wealth is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job Now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa our second challenge will be who are the wealth-creating agents in any society They are entrepreneurs Unclear told us they are always about four percent of the population but 16 percent are imitators But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship So where should we be putting the money We need to put money where it can productively grow Support private investment in Africa both domestic and foreign Support research institutions because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today They are throwing large sums of money for primary health for primary education for food relief The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair in need of charity Ladies and gentlemen can any one of you tell me a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who became rich by receiving charity By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms Does any one of you in the audience have that person Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another Well since I'm not seeing the hand it appears that what I'm stating is true Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country Which country is that AM: Thank you very much But let me tell you this External actors can only present to you an opportunity The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity Africa has received many opportunities Many of them we haven't benefited much Why Because we lack the internal institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations I'll give you an example Under the Cotonou Agreement formerly known as the Lome Convention African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods duty-free to the European Union market My own country Uganda has a quota to export 50，000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market We haven't exported one kilogram yet We import 50，000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba Secondly under the beef protocol of that agreement African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market None of those countries including Africa's most successful nation Botswana has ever met its quota So I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework And all forms of intervention need support the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth the kinds of institutions that increase productivity How do we begin to do that and why is aid the bad instrument Aid is the bad instrument and do you know why Because all governments across the world need money to survive Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial they need really to have the army clobber the opposition The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on Why should people support their government Well because it gives them good paying jobs or in many African countries unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption The fact is no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of Idi Amin can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule Many countries in the unclear they need legitimacy To get legitimacy governments often need to deliver things like primary education primary health roads build hospitals and clinics If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion It will sit with those who create wealth Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy it lies with international donors Rather than sit with Ugandan -- -- rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs Ghanaian businessmen South African enterprising leaders our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank I can tell you even if you have ten Ph。Ds。 you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry Why Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people the private sector actors in that industry Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need In the process we the African people have been sidelined from the policy-making policy-orientation and policy- implementation process in our countries We have limited input because he who pays the piper calls the tune The IMF the World Bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens and therefore what our governments are doing because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens But I want to put a caveat on my argument and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive Some aid may have built a hospital fed a hungry village It may have built a road and that road may have served a very good role The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success generalize them pour billions and trillions of dollars into them and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village the skills the practices the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in Sauri village in Kenya where Jeffrey Sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody Aid increases the resources available to governments and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in Africa seeking a career By increasing the political attractiveness of the state especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie Ladies and gentlemen the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business Governments are not changing it Why Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens They talk to international donors So the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid I also want to say that it is important for us to note that over the last 50 years Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community in the form of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aid Between 1960 and 2003 our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa Where has all the aid gone I want to use the example of my own country called Uganda and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there In the 2006-2007 budget expected revenue: 2。5 trillion shillings The expected foreign aid: 1。9 trillion Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean Hand-to-mouth is 2。6 trillion Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid who contributes for it But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure Public administration which is largely patronage takes 690 billion The military 380 billion Agriculture which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens takes only 18 billion Trade and industry takes 43 billion And let me show you what does public expenditure -- rather public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute There you go 70 cabinet ministers 114 presidential advisers by the way who never see the president except on television And when they see him physically it is at public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them We have 81 units of local government Each local government is organized like the central government -- a bureaucracy a cabinet a parliament and so many jobs for the political hangers-on There were 56 and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits he had to create 25 new districts and now there are 81 Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies all of which have directors and the cars And the final thing this is addressed to Mr Bono In his work he may help us on this A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3，000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters Uganda has 961 sub-counties each of them with a dispensary none of which has an ambulance So the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers the permanent secretaries the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects while the poor die without ambulances and medicine Finally I want to say that before I came to speak here I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt It should be short enough to arouse interest but long enough to cover the subject I hope I have achieved that Thank you very much I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation hopefully for a good cause which is self-improvement And I've done this in three parts So first I started with the mind And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or more precisely from a-ak to Zywiec And here's a little image of that And this was an amazing year It was really a fascinating journey It was painful at times especially for those around me My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation So it had its downsides But after that I decided to work on the spirit As I mentioned last year I grew up with no religion at all I'm Jewish but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian Not really But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave So this is what I looked like by the end Thank you for that reaction I look a little like Moses or Ted Kaczynski I got both of them So there was the topiary there And there's the sheep Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be the healthiest person alive So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years And I just finished a couple of months ago And I have to say thank God Because living so healthily was killing me It was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it's just mind-boggling I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers And they were telling me all the things I had to do I had to eat right exercise meditate pet dogs because that lowers the blood pressure I wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book I had to put on sunscreen This was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen And you have to reapply it every two to four hours So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year There was the washing of hands I had to do that properly And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house because those are just orgies of germs So that took a lot of time I also tried to be the safest person I could be because that's a part of health I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council They started a public campaign that says A walking helmet is a good helmet So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking but also for walking around And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets Well yeah I tried that Now it's a little extreme I admit But if you think about this this is actually -- the Freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple So I finished and it was a success in a sense All of the markers went in the right direction My cholesterol went down I lost weight my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant So that was nice And it was successful overall But I also learned that I was too healthy and that was unhealthy I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family And as Dan Buettner can tell you having a strong social network is so crucial to our health So I finished And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over I went to the dark side and I just indulged myself It was like something out of Caligula Without the sex part Because I have three young kids so that wasn't happening But the over-eating and over-drinking definitely And I finally have stabilized So now I'm back to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year It was really a life-changing project And I of course don't have time to go into all of them Let me just tell you two really quickly The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now Because we live in such a noisy world There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly he's very noisy And this is a real underestimated under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing which it obviously does but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going And this over the years can cause real damage cardiovascular damage The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year And it was done in Europe And they estimated that 1。6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution So they think it's actually very deadly And by the way it's also terrible for your brain It really impairs cognition And our Founding Fathers knew about this When they wrote the Constitution they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate So without noise reduction technology our country would not exist So as a patriot I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way And the second point I want to make the final point is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them And just to give you one instance of this: food The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food To give just one example we love crunchiness mouthfeel So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos And it has made me a healthier person So that is it The book about it comes out in April It's called Drop Dead Healthy And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour That's my greatest hope So thank you very much This is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it's made with a new technique that I've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method And I call it an epoxy method because -- it's not very appetizing I understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy what's epoxy It's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens A bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful adhesive Well in this technique what I've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world the artisan bread-baking community has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads And let's face it everyone's trying to move towards whole grains We finally after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them The challenge though for a wholegrain baker is you know how do you make it taste good Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread White flour is sweet It's mainly starch and starch when you break it down -- what is starch It's -- thank you -- sugar yes So a baker and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch With whole grain bread you have other obstacles You've got bran which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the bran is fiber It's got germ Those are the good things but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat So whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads and people don't like to eat quote health food They like to eat healthy and healthily but when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion and love for the flavor And ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor Flavor is king Flavor rules I call it the flavor rule Flavor rules And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once but they won't eat it again if they don't like it right So this is the challenge for this bread We're going to try this at lunch and I'll explain a bit more about it but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened It's just dough that is wet It's hydrated dough we call the soaker -- that helps to start enzyme activity And enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough that brings out flavor It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch That's what enzymes are doing And so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us in our palate They become accessible to the yeast as food They become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust The other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a biga or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also And on day two we put those two pieces together That's the epoxy And we're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain That's the challenge Okay so now what we -- in the journey of wheat let's go back and look at these 12 stages I'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them Okay we're going to start with the first stage And this is what every student has to begin with Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place which is just a French way of saying get organized Everything in its place First stage So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients Stage two is mixing We take the ingredients and we mix them We have to develop the gluten There's no gluten in flour There's only the potential for gluten Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we've got glutenin and gliadin neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a stronger molecule a stronger protein we call gluten And so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly Then we get into fermentation the third stage which is really where the flavor develops The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating which is what bread is It's yeast burps and sweat And somehow this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food and we're going to explore that in a minute But then quickly through the next few stages We after it's fermented and it's developed started to develop flavor and character we divide it into smaller units And then we take those units and we shape them We give them a little pre-shape usually a round or a little torpedo shape sometimes That's called rounding And there's a short rest period It can be for a few seconds It can be for 20 or 30 minutes We call that resting or benching Then we go into final shaping panning -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan This takes a second but it's a distinctive stage It can be in a basket It can be in a loaf pan but we pan it And then stage nine The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages Again developing more flavor The final fermentation takes place in stage nine We call it proofing Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 Three transformations take place in the oven The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust They give us that beautiful brown crust Only the crust can caramelize It's the only place that gets hot enough Inside the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates When it gets to about 160 degrees the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread And the starches when they reach about 180 degrees gelatinize And gelatinization is yet another oven transformation Coagulation caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them they -- they kind of swell and then they burst And they burst and they spill their guts into the bread So basically now we're eating yeast sweats -- sweat burps and starch guts Again transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread And stage 11 we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away There's a little carry-over baking The proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up And then we have stage 12 which the textbooks call packaging but my students call eating And so we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat and in a few minutes we will try this and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor But I want to go back now and revisit these steps and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because I really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels: the literal the metaphoric or poetic level the political or ethical level And ultimately the mystical or sometimes called the anagogical level It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal In fact Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level so that's why we're talking literally about bread But let's kind of look at these stages again from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question What is it about bread that's so special And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor Because what happens is bread begins as wheat or any other grain But what's wheat Wheat is a grass that grows in the field And like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds And we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels Now in order to harvest it -- I mean what's harvesting It's just a euphemism for killing right I mean that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig you know Yes we slaughter you know Yes that's life We harvest the wheat and in harvesting it we kill it Now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds Now at least with seeds we have the potential for future life We can plant those in the ground And we save some of those for the next generation But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour And at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity It's not only been killed but it's been denied any potential for creating future life So we turn it into flour So as I said I think bread is a transformational food The first transformation -- and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else O。K。 Radical not subtle Not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam That's a transformation two different things Well in this case the first transformation is alive to dead I'd call that radical So we've got now this flour And what do we do We add some water In stage one we weigh it In stage two we add water and salt to it mix it together and we create something that we call clay It's like clay And we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call leaven In this case it's yeast but yeast is leaven What does leaven mean Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify to bring to life By the way what's the Hebrew word for clay Adam You see the baker in this moment has become in a sense sort of the God of his dough you know and his dough well while it's not an intelligent life form is now alive And we know it's alive because in stage three it grows Growth is the proof of life And while it's growing all these literal transformations are taking place Enzymes are breaking forth sugars Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol Bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids In other words personality and character's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients That's the art of baking So all these things are determined by the baker and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop And then we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of those units are given shape by the baker And as they're shaped they're raised again all along proving that they're alive and developing character And at stage 10 we take it to the oven It's still dough Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do I think but not too many I've met some dough eaters but -- it's not the staff of life right Bread is the staff of life But dough is what we're working with and we take that dough to the oven and it goes into the oven As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees it passes what we call the thermal death point Students love that TDP They think it's the name of a video game But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there The yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread has to give up its life So you see the symbolism at work It's starting to come forth a little bit you know It's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive comes out dead Third transformation First transformation alive to dead Second transformation dead brought back to life Third transformation alive to dead -- but dough to bread Or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life This is the product that everyone in the world eats that is so difficult to give up It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life It's used as a symbol for transformation And so as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that again completing the life cycle you know we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this So this is what I've learned from bread This is what bread has taught me in my journey And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use in addition to everything we talked about this bread we're going to call spent grain bread because as you know bread-making is very similar to beer-making Beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer And -- they -- they're invented around the same time I think beer came first And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot Egyptian sun and it turned into bread But we've got this bread and what I did here is to try to again evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making And if you make this bread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer I like dark spent grain Today we're using a light spent grain that's actually from like some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted In other words the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting We're going to take some of that and put it into the bread So now we not only have a high-fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber And so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread but a bread that you will enjoy So if I kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here We'll start a little piece here and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch I'll leave you with what I call the baker's blessing May your crust be crisp and your bread always rise Thank you Hi So today I'd like to share some works in progress Since we are still realizing these works we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery still So I'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we're looking for through each of the works So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall Within seconds as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry So this is the sketch of the two states One is total chaos The other is absolute order And we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state This also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions One is the altar tablets of the 15th century and the other is about 100 years ago Malevich's abstract compositions So I'm just going to take you to a video To give you a sense of scale the largest panel is about two meters high That's about this much And the smallest one is an A4 So a viewer enters the space and they snap to attention And after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention So here it appears as if it's the viewer that's sort of instigating the sense of order among the panels but it could also be the other way around that the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant So this brings me to a quieter small work called Handheld The viewer sees a piece of paper that's mounted on the far end of the wall but when you go closer you see that it's a blank A4 or a letter-sized piece of paper that's held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time and somehow are not managing to So this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips One is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel So here's a video You have to imagine the other hand It's not there yet But to us we're sort of trying to evoke a self-effacing gesture as if there's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them The next work is Decoy This is a cardboard model so the object is about as tall as I am It has a rounded body two arms and a very tall head-like antenna and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself So when a viewer passes by it sort of tilts from side to side and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer So here is the first test scenario You see the two movements integrated and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention it's no longer interested and it looks for the next person whose attention to get So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines Because we are always working from a very personal space we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance at least And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help The next work is an object that's also a kind of sound instrument In the shape of an amphitheater that's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage So from where I'm standing each of you appears to be this big and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision Seated in this audience are 996 small figures They're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will This means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap how hard for how long how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others and if they want to contribute to innovation So when the viewer steps in front of the audience there will be a response It could be a few claps or a strong applause and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage and again the audience will respond It could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience or it could be a very loud ovation So to us I think we're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it an instrument So the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied nuanced musical or sound patterns but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it So here if you see we're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands So here's a small visual animation as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension And here is a prototype So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them Okay this is the last work It's called the Framerunners It comes out of the idea of a window This is an actual window in our studio and as you can see it's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections So we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid that's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures They're also made up of three different sizes as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain Each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two adjacent tracks So in contrast to this very tight grid we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path So we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like they're oblivious and carefree and happy-go-lucky and content until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall So to us this work also presents its own contradiction These figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid which is like a prison but also a fortress because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world So all these real life qualities that I talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration and we were very lucky to collaborate with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype So you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head-bobbing movement and the back-and-forth movement So it's really quite small You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand So imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio and here it is Thank you For a moment what I need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination We're in 17th century Japan on the west coast and a little wizened monk is hurrying along near midnight to the crest of a small hill He arrives on the small hill dripping with water He stands there and he looks across at the island Sado And he scans across the ocean and he looks at the sky Then he says to himself very quietly Turbulent the sea Stretching across to Sado The Milky Way Basho was a brilliant man He said more with less than any human that I have ever read or talked to Basho in 17 syllables juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets maybe even an ocean that we will probably call Sylvia in time As he was nearing his death his disciples and followers kept asking him What's the secret How can you make haiku poems so beautiful so easily And toward the end he said If you would know the pine tree go to the pine tree That was it Sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have in order to know the oceans If we would know the oceans we must go to the oceans And what I'd like to talk to you today about a little bit is really transforming the relationship or the interplay between humans and oceans with a new capability that is not at all routine yet I hope it will be There are a few key points One of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth Another is that there are bold new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet And the last is that these bold new ways that we are exploring as a community will transform the way we look at our planet our oceans and eventually how we manage probably the entire planet for what it's worth So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system They define what the system is The system isn't Chesapeake Bay It's not the Kuril arc It's not even the entire Pacific It's the whole planet the entire planet continents and oceans together That's the system And basically our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes two sources of energy one of which is solar that drives the winds the waves the clouds the storms and photosynthesis The second one is internal energy And these two war against one another almost continuously Mountain ranges plate tectonics moves the continents around forms ore deposits Volcanoes erupt That's the planet that we live on It's immensely complex Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here but what I want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously and have for the last 4 billion years This is a system that's been around a very long time And these have all co-evolved What do I mean by that They interact with one another constantly All of them interact with one another So the complexity of this system that we're looking at the one driven by the sun -- upper portion mostly -- and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes This is very very important because this is the system this is the crucible out of which life on the planet came and it's now time for us to understand it We must understand it That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about: understand this ocean of ours this basic life support system the dominant life support system on the planet Look at this complexity here This is only one variable If you can see the complexity you can see how tiny little eddies and large eddies and the motion -- this is just sea surface temperature but it's immensely complicated Now a layer in the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting partly as a function of temperature partly as a function of all the other factors and you've got a really complicated system That's our challenge is to understand understand this system in new and phenomenal ways And there's an urgency to this Part of the urgency comes from the fact that of order a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving And part of the issue is for Cody -- who's here 16 years old -- and I have permission to relay this number When he 40 years from now is the age of Nancy Brown there are going to be another two and a half billion people on the planet We can't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans but if we don't understand the fundamental life support system of this planet much more thoroughly than we do now then the stresses that we will face and that Cody will face and even Nancy who's going to live till she's 98 will have really problems coping All right let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans Look at this diagram which is showing warm waters in red cool waters in blue and on the continents what you're seeing in bright green is the growth of vegetation and in olive green the dieback of vegetation And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away from 1982 to 1998 and then cycling again What you'll see is that the rhythms of growth of vegetation -- a subset of which is food on the continents -- is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface temperatures The oceans control or at least significantly influence correlate with the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents So people in Kansas in a wheat field in Kansas need to understand that the oceans are central to them as well Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans I'm going to layer in on top of this the tectonic plates The age of the ocean the tectonic plates gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about in this conference And I share with you some very high-definition video that we collected in real time Seconds after this video was taken people in Beijing people in Sydney people in Amsterdam people in Washington D。C were watching this Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor there is vast reservoir of microbial activity which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study Some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet It's an astonishing insight and we have only found out about this recently This is very very exciting It may be the next rainforest in terms of pharmaceuticals We know little or nothing about it Well Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying that The real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory but possibly in having new sets of eyes new ways of seeing things a new mindset And many of you remember the early stages of oceanography when we had to use what we had at our fingertips And it wasn't easy It wasn't easy in those days Some of you remember this I'm sure And now we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful -- ships satellites moorings But they don't quite cut it They don't quite give us what we need And the program that I wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here was funded and it involves autonomous vehicles like the one running across the base of this image Modeling: on the right hand side there's a very complex computational model On the left hand side there's a new type of mooring which I'll show you in just a second And on the basis of several points the oceans are complex and they're central to the life on earth They are changing rapidly but not predictably And the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them The computational power is amazing But without data those models will never ever be predicted And that's what we really need For a variety of reasons they're dangerous but we feel that OOI this Ocean Observatory Initiative which the National Science Foundation has begun to fund has the potential to really transform things And the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across and within the ocean basins utilizing widely accessible interactive telepresence It's a new world We will be present throughout the volume of the ocean at will communicating in real time And this is what the system involves a number of sites in the southern hemisphere shown in those circles And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites I won't talk a lot about most of them right here but the one on the west coast that's in the box is called the regional scale nodes It was once called Neptune And let me show you what's behind it Fiber: next-generation way of communicating You can see the copper tips on these things You can transmit power but the bandwidth is in those tiny little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter And this particular set here can transmit something of the order of three to five terabits per second This is phenomenal bandwidth And this is what the planet looks like We are already laced up as if we're in a fiber optic corset if you like This is what it looks like And the cables go really continent to continent It's a very powerful system and most of our communications consist of it So this is the system that I'm talking about off the west coast It's coincident with the tectonic plate the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate And it's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume -- in the overlying ocean on the sea floor and below the sea floor Bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes that will be operating This is what one of those primary nodes looks like and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle And the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table They will bring it and link it in It'll be in a sense like having time on a telescope except you'll have your own port Climate change ocean acidification dissolved oxygen carbon cycle coastal upwelling fishing dynamics -- the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume So anyone coming along later simply accesses the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place And this is just the first of these In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues we've set this up Now I want to take you into the caldera On the left hand side there is a large volcano called Axial Seamount And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount using animation Here's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point Very powerful That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it Or they can transfer control to someone in India or China who can take over for a while because it's all going to be directly connected through the Internet There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore all available to anyone who has any interest in using it This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location then move to a new location We're flying across the caldera floor There is a number of robotic systems There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will if those are your experiments The kinds of systems that will be down there the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor consist of -- if you can read them there -- there's cameras there's pressure sensors fluorometers there's seismometers It's a full spectrum of tools Now that mound right there actually looks like this This is what it actually looks like And this is the kind of activity that we can see with high-definition video because the bandwidth of these cables is so huge that we could have five to 10 stereo HD systems running continuously and again directed through robotic techniques from land Very very powerful And these are the things that we're funded to do today So what can we actually do tomorrow We're about to ride the wave of technological opportunity There are emerging technologies throughout the field around oceanography which we will incorporate into oceanography and through that convergence we will transform oceanography into something even more magical Robotics systems are just incredible these days absolutely incredible And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean Nanotechnology: this is a small generator It's smaller than a postage stamp and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move Just as you move it generates power There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean continuously Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in HD will be routine within five years And this is the magic one As a result of the human genome process we are in a situation where events that take place in the ocean -- like an erupting volcano or something of that sort -- can actually be sampled We pump the fluid through one of these systems and we press the button and it's analyzed for the genomic character And that's transmitted back to land immediately So in the volume of the ocean we will know not just the physics and the chemistry but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis Grid computing: the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here We will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything like adjust the data and everything that goes with the data The power generation will come from the ocean itself And the next generation fiber will be simply magic It's far beyond what we currently have So the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented So within five to seven years I see us having a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean and have all of that connected to the Internet so we can reach many many folks Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation Here's an example When earthquakes take place massive amounts of these new microbes we've never seen before come out of the sea floor We have a way of addressing that a new way of addressing that We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting so we deploy the troops What are the troops The troops are the autonomous vehicles of course And they fly into the erupting volcano They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before They eject it to the surface where it floats and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane and it's brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption This is doable All the pieces are there A laboratory: many of you heard what happened on 9/7 Some doctors in New York City removed the gallbladder of a woman in France We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning and it would be on live TV if we have interesting things to show So we can bring an entirely new telepresence to the world throughout the ocean This -- I've shown you sea floor -- but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth It's going to be amazing And as I go here I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms and indeed what we can bring into your pocket Many of you don't think of this yet but the ocean will be in your pocket It won't be long It won't be long So let me leave you then with a few words from another poet if you'll forgive me In 1943 T。S Eliot wrote the Four Quartets He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948 In Little Gidding he says -- speaking I think for the human race but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia -- We shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time arrive through the unknown remembered gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning At the source of the longest river the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for but heard half heard in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea Thank you I want to start my story in Germany in 1877 with a mathematician named Georg Cantor And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process a recursive process So he starts out with one line and then two and then four and then 16 and so on And if he does this an infinite number of times which you can do in mathematics he ends up with an infinite number of lines each of which has an infinite number of points in it So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity And this blew his mind Literally He checked into a sanitarium And when he came out of the sanitarium he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself He was a very religious man He was a mathematician on a mission And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing A Swedish mathematician von Koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them And so he came up with this beautiful curve And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape; we can use any seed shape we like And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there OK -- and now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure So these all have the property of self-similarity: the part looks like the whole It's the same pattern at many different scales Now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a longer and longer length And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times as the ruler shrinks down to infinity the length goes to infinity This made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books They said these are pathological curves and we don't have to discuss them And that worked for a hundred years And then in 1977 Benoit Mandelbrot a French mathematician realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals you get the shapes of nature You get the human lungs you get acacia trees you get ferns you get these beautiful natural forms If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet -- go ahead and do that now -- -- and relax your hand you'll see a crinkle and then a wrinkle within the crinkle and a crinkle within the wrinkle Right Your body is covered with fractals The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes They were breathing those words with fractal lungs It's very ironic And I'll show you a little natural recursion here Again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape So here's the second iteration and the third fourth and so on So nature has this self-similar structure Nature uses self-organizing systems Now in the 1980s I happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village you see fractals And I thought This is fabulous I wonder why And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals which is a great job if you can get it And so I finally got to this city and I'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when I got there I got to the palace of the chief and my French is not very good; I said something like I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof But he was really cool about it and he took me up there and we talked about fractals And he said Oh yeah yeah We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle we know all about that And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here And as you go through the path you have to get more and more polite So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling; it's a conscious pattern It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal This is a village in southern Zambia The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter You have a huge ring The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back and then the chief's immediate family in that ring So here's a little fractal model for it Here's one house with the sacred altar here's the house of houses the family enclosure with the humans here where the sacred altar would be and then here's the village as a whole -- a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here the chief's immediate family here and here there's a tiny village only this big Now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big That's because they're spirit people It's the ancestors And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village right So it's just like Georg Cantor said the recursion continues forever This is in the Mandara mountains near the Nigerian border in Cameroon Mokoulek I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect and I thought Wow What a beautiful fractal So I tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing I came up with this structure here Let's see first iteration second third fourth Now after I did the simulation I realized the whole village kind of spirals around just like this and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal Well I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at So when I got to the village I said Can you take me to the square building I think something's going on there And they said Well we can take you there but you can't go inside because that's the sacred altar where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales So here's a Nankani village in Mali And you can see you go inside the family enclosure -- you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace stacked recursively Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us and they're stacked recursively Now the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul And when she dies they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity Once again infinity is important Now you might ask yourself three questions at this point Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture And that was actually my original hypothesis When I first saw those African fractals I thought Wow so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society that sort of hierarchy must have a kind of bottom-up architecture But that turns out not to be true I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture; only the African ones were fractal And if you think about it all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry You can see on the pottery and the baskets Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins; you can see it's circular at the largest scale but it's rectangular at the smaller scale right It is not the same pattern at two different scales Second you might ask Well Dr Eglash aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures And three times the answer is no First of all I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book The Invention of Africa that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movements No because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not in the DNA And finally the fractals have self-similarity -- so they're similar to themselves but they're not necessarily similar to each other -- you see very different uses for fractals It's a shared technology in Africa And finally well isn't this just intuition It's not really mathematical knowledge Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry right It wasn't invented until the 1970s Well it's true that some African fractals are as far as I'm concerned just pure intuition So some of these things I'd wander around the streets of Dakar asking people What's the algorithm What's the rule for making this and they'd say Well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid But sometimes that's not the case In some cases there would actually be algorithms and very sophisticated algorithms So in Manghetu sculpture you'd see this recursive geometry In Ethiopian crosses you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape In Angola the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph; we now call it an Eulerian path -- you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice But they do it recursively and they do it with an age-grade system so the little kids learn this one and then the older kids learn this one then the next age-grade initiation you learn this one And with each iteration of that algorithm you learn the iterations of the myth You learn the next level of knowledge And finally all over Africa you see this board game It's called Owari in Ghana where I studied it; it's called Mancala here on the East Coast Bao in Kenya Sogo elsewhere Well you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns and would use them strategically So this is very conscious knowledge Here's a wonderful fractal Anywhere you go in the Sahel you'll see this windscreen And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian all strictly linear But here in Africa you've got these nonlinear scaling fences So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako and I asked him How come you're making fractal fences Because nobody else is And his answer was very interesting He said Well if I lived in the jungle I would only use the long rows of straw because they're very quick and they're very cheap It doesn't take much time doesn't take much straw He said but wind and dust goes through pretty easily Now the tight rows up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust But it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight Now he said we know from experience that the farther up from the ground you go the stronger the wind blows Right It's just like a cost-benefit analysis And I measured out the lengths of straw put it on a log-log plot got the scaling exponent and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was Bamana sand divination And the same divination system is found all over Africa You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast and often the symbols are very well preserved so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly and then you count off and if it's an odd number you put down one stroke and if it's an even number you put down two strokes And they did this very rapidly and I couldn't understand where they were getting -- they only did the randomness four times -- I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols And they wouldn't tell me They said No no I can't tell you about this And I said Well look I'll pay you you can be my teacher and I'll come each day and pay you They said It's not a matter of money This is a religious matter And finally out of desperation I said Well let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877 And I started explaining why I was there in Africa and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set And one of them said Come here I think I can help you out here And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest And of course I was only interested in the math so the whole time he kept shaking his head going You know I didn't learn it this way But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed buried in sand and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on And finally he revealed the truth of the matter And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos When you have a four-bit symbol you then put it together with another one sideways So even plus odd gives you odd Odd plus even gives you odd Even plus even gives you even Odd plus odd gives you even It's addition modulo 2 just like in the parity bit check on your computer And then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this Now because it's a binary code you can actually implement this in hardware -- what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical In the 12th century Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy: divination through the earth This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390 Leibniz the German mathematician talked about geomancy in his dissertation called De Combinatoria And he said Well instead of using one stroke and two strokes let's use a one and a zero and we can count by powers of two Right Ones and zeros the binary code George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer So all these little PDAs and laptops -- every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers but you know I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this And you can go to our website the applets are all free; they just run in the browser Anybody in the world can use them The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools so hopefully in three years anybody'll be able to go on the Web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts We've focused in the U。S on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with a control group that did not have the software So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics that it's not just about singing and dancing We've started a pilot program in Ghana We got a small seed grant just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this; we're very excited about the future possibilities for that We've also been working in design I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague Kerry in Kenya has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village it doesn't quite fit Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture in which he's used some of these fractal structures And finally I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization as we heard earlier it's in the brain It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine Actually the reason that Google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web It's in ecological sustainability It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship the ethical power of democracy It's also in some bad things Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast And if you don't think that capitalism which is self-organizing can have destructive effects you haven't opened your eyes enough So we need to think about as was spoken earlier the traditional African methods for doing self-organization These are robust algorithms These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship -- that are gentle that are egalitarian So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms Thank you This is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs I'm going to show you today It was taken 18 years ago I was 19 years old at the time I had just returned from one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time -- a little over 200 feet -- and I had caught this little fish here It turns out that that particular one was the first live one of that ever taken alive I'm not just an ichthyologist I'm a bona fide fish nerd And to a fish nerd this is some pretty exciting stuff And more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named Jack Randall the greatest living ichthyologist on Earth the Grand Poobah of fish nerds if you will And so it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time it really set the course for the rest of my life But really the most significant thing the most profound thing about this picture is that it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed from the neck down I made a really stupid kind of mistake that most 19-year-old males do when they think they're immortal and I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed and had to be flown back for treatment I learned two really important things that day The first thing I learned -- well I'm mortal that's a really big one And the second thing I learned was that I knew with profound certainty that this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs Now when you think of a coral reef this is what most people think of: all these big hard elaborate corals and lots of bright colorful fishes and things But this is really just the tip of the iceberg If you look at this diagram of a coral reef we know a lot about that part up near the top and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it There is a problem with scuba though in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet I'll get into why that is in just a minute But the point is that scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep and very rarely go much below this at least not with any kind of sanity So to go deeper most biologists have turned to submersibles Now submersibles are great wonderful things but if you're going to spend 30，000 dollars a day to use one of these things and it's capable of going 2，000 feet you're sure not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet you're going to go way way way down deep So the bottom line is that almost all research using submersibles has taken place well below 500 feet Now it's pretty obvious at this point that there's this zone here in the middle and that's the zone that really centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness I want to find out what's in this zone We know almost nothing about it Scuba divers can't get there submarines go right on past it It took me a year to learn how to walk again after I had my diving accident in Palau and during that year I spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and figuring out how to overcome these limitations So I'm just going to show you a basic idea We're all breathing air right now Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen about 20 percent oxygen About 80 percent nitrogen is in our lungs And there's a phenomenon called Henry's Law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to So basically the gas dissolves into our body The oxygen is bound by metabolism we use it for energy The nitrogen just sort of floats around in our blood and tissues and that's all fine that's how we're designed The problem happens when you start to go underwater Now the deeper you go underwater the higher the pressure is If you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet which is the recommended limit for most scuba divers you get this pressure effect And the effect of that pressure is that you have an increased density of gas molecules in every breath you take Over time those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up Now if you were to go down to say 300 feet you don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs -- you've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs And sure enough they dissolve into your blood and into your tissues as well And of course if you were to down to where there's 15 times as much -- the deeper you go the more exacerbating the problem becomes And the problem the limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body -- all the nitrogen and all the oxygen There're three basic limitations of scuba diving The first limitation is the oxygen -- oxygen toxicity Now we all know the song: Love is like oxygen。/ You get too much you get too high。/ Not enough and you're going to die Well in the context of diving you get too much you die also You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater not a good thing to happen underwater It happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body The nitrogen has two problems One of them is what Jacques Cousteau called rapture of the deep It's nitrogen narcosis It makes you loopy The deeper you go the loopier you get You don't want to drive drunk you don't want to dive drunk so that's a real big problem And of course the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau which is the bends Now the one thing that I forgot to mention is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium Now helium's a gas there're a lot of reasons why helium's good it's a tiny molecule it's inert it doesn't give you narcosis So that's the basic concept that we use But the theory's relatively easy The tricky part is the implementation So this is how I began about 15 years ago I'll admit it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts but you know you got to start somewhere At the time I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing -- almost nobody did And this rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet Over time we got a little bit better at it and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig with four scuba tanks and five regulators and all the right gas mixtures and all that good stuff And it was fine and dandy and it allowed us to go down and find new species This picture was taken 300 feet deep catching new species of fish But the problem was that it didn't allow us much time For all its bulk and size it only gave us about 15 minutes at most down at those sorts of depths We needed more time There had to be a better way And indeed there is a better way In 1994 I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers Alright closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba and why is it better Well there are three main advantages to a rebreather One they're quiet they don't make any noise Two they allow you to stay underwater longer Three they allow you to go deeper How is it that they do that Well in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood and look underneath and see what's going on There are three basic systems to a closed- circuit rebreather The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it and it's a closed loop and you breathe the same gas around and around and around So there's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth and there's also a counterlung or in this case two counterlungs Now the counterlungs aren't high-tech they're just simply flexible bags They allow you to mechanically breathe or mechanically ventilate When you exhale your breath it goes in the exhale counterlung: when you inhale a breath it comes from the inhale counterlung It's just pure mechanics allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop And the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister Now as we breathe we produce carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas -- so that when it comes back to us to breathe again it's safe to breathe again So that's the breathing loop in a nutshell The second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather is the gas system The primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen to replenish the oxygen that your body consumes So the main tank the main critical thing is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here But if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn't be able to go very deep because we'd run into oxygen toxicity very very quickly So we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with And that fittingly enough is called the diluent gas supply In our applications we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply because it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen So that's where we get our nitrogen from But if we want to go deeper of course we need another gas supply We need helium and the helium is what we really need to go deep And usually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder mounted exterior on the rebreather like this And that's what we use to inject as we start to do our deep dives We also have a second oxygen cylinder that's solely as a back-up in case there's a problem with our first oxygen supply we can continue to breathe And the way you manage all these different gases and all these different gas supplies is this really high-tech sophisticated gas block up on the front here where it's easy to reach It's got all the valves and knobs and things you need to do to inject the right gases at the right time Now normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics the third system of a rebreather The most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors You need three of them so that if one of them goes bad you know which one it is You need voting logic You also have three microprocessors Any one of those computers can run the entire system so if you have to lose two of them there's also back-up power supplies And of course there're multiple displays to get the information to the diver This is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep dives And I can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but I want to move on to something that's kind of much more interesting I'm going to take you on a deep dive I'm going to show you what it's like to do one of these dives that we do We start up here on the boat and for all this high-tech expensive equipment this is still the best way to get in the water -- just pfft -- flop over the side of the boat Now as I showed you in the earlier diagram these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically completely straight down So we drop in the water and we just sort of go over the edge of this cliff and then we just start dropping dropping dropping People have asked me It must take a long time to get there No it only takes a couple of minutes to get all the way down to three or four hundred feet which is where we're aiming for It's kind of like skydiving in slow motion It's really a very interesting -- you ever see The Abyss where Ed Harris you know he's sinking down along the side of the wall That's kind of what it feels like It's pretty amazing Also when you get down there you find that the water is very very clear It's extremely clear water because there's hardly any plankton But when you turn on your light you look around at the caves and all of a sudden you're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity much more than anyone used to believe Now not all of it is new species -- like that fish you see with the white stripe that's a known species But if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices you'll see little things scurrying all over the place There's a just-unbelievable diversity It's not just fish either These are crinoids sponges black corals There're some more fishes And those fishes that you see right now are new species They're still new species because I had a video camera on this dive instead of my net so they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them But this is what it looks like and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles This is Papua New Guinea Now little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there We also see sharks much more regularly than I would have expected to And we're not quite sure why But what I want you to do right now is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater with all this high-tech gear on your back you're in a remote reef off Papua New Guinea thousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber and you're completely surrounded by sharks Look at those 。。 Uh-oh 。。 uh-oh I think we have their attention Richard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck there's no situation in the world that can seem tense So we're down there and this is at 400 feet -- that's looking straight up by the way so you can get a sense of how far away the surface is And if you're a biologist and you know about sharks and you want to assess you know how much jeopardy am I really in here there's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- Diver 1 What kind of sharks Diver 2: Uh silvertip sharks Diver 1: Oh RP: Silvertip sharks -- they're actually three species of sharks here The silvertips are the one with the white edges on the fin and there're also gray reef sharks and some hammerheads off in the distance And yes it's a little nerve-wracking Diver 2 Hoo That little guy is frisky Now you've seen video like this on TV a lot and it's very intimidating and I think it gives the wrong impression about sharks Sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that's why we weren't worried much why we were joking around down there More people are killed by pigs more people are killed by lightning strikes more people are killed at soccer games in England There's a lot of other ways you can die And I'm not making that stuff up Coconuts You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be Now I don't know if any of you get U。S News and World Report -- I got the recent issue There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time The last article is an article entitled No New Frontiers It questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there whether there are any real true hardcore discoveries that can still be made And this is my favorite line from the article As a fish nerd I have to laugh because you know they don't call us fish nerds for nothing -- we actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy But it's much more than that And I want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years This one's -- you know you can see how ugly it is Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing just look at the monetary value of this thing A couple of these ended up getting sold through the aquarium trade to Japan where they sold for 15，000 dollars apiece That's half-a-million dollars per pound Here's another new angelfish we discovered This one we actually first discovered back in the air days -- the bad old air days as we used to say -- when we were doing these kind of dives with air We were at 360 feet And I remember coming up from one of these deep dives and I had this fog and the narcosis takes a little while to you know fade away It's sort of like sobering up And I had this vague recollection of seeing these yellow fish with a black spot and I thought Aw damn I should have caught one I think that's a new species And then eventually I got around to looking in my bucket Sure enough I had caught one -- I just completely forgot that I had caught one And so this one we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to So that's it's official scientific name in reference to its deep-dwelling habits And this is another neat one When we first found it we weren't even sure what family this thing belonged to so we just called it the Dr Seuss fish because it looked like something out of one of those books Now this one's pretty cool If you go to Papua New Guinea and go down 300 feet you're going to see these big mounds And this may be kind of hard to see but they're about -- oh a couple meters in diameter If you look closely you'll see there's a little white fish and gray fish that hangs out near them Well it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds one pebble at a time It's really extraordinary to find something like this It's not just new species: it's new behavior it's new ecology it's all kind of new things So what I'm going to show you right now very quickly is just a sampling of a few of the new species we've discovered What's extraordinary about this is not just the sheer number of species we're finding -- although as you can see that's pretty amazing this is only half of what we've found -- what's extraordinary is how quickly we find them We're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth Now if you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree you may get a lot of bugs but for fishes there's nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time Now we've done some back of the envelope calculations and we're predicting that there are probably on the order of 2，000 to 2，500 new species in the Indo-Pacific alone There are only five to six thousand known species So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently not And I'm going to just close on a very somber note At the beginning I told you that I was going to show you two extraordinary photographs This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head And the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life Less than 60 seconds after this picture was taken this guy was dead When we recovered his body we figured out what had gone wrong He had made a very simple mistake He turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder -- he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had 40 He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned The reason I show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general which is that we all have two goals The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet which is to survive I call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves because they're both about perpetuating the genome And the second goal for those of us who have mastered that first goal is to -- you know you call it spiritual fulfillment you can call it financial success you can call it any number of different things I call it seeking joy -- this pursuit of happiness So I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest he absolutely did You have to balance those two goals If you live your whole life in fear -- I mean life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality So you can't live your life in fear I thought that was an old one But at the same time you don't want to get so focused on rule number two or goal number two that you neglect goal number one Because once you're dead you really can't enjoy anything after that I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance in your future endeavors Thanks I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie -- and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes Aha we meet again Mr Bond It was great So I've got a little sheet of paper here mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone I'll talk for like two hours I just want to say good afternoon good evening It's been an incredible few days It's downhill from now on I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris But also most importantly all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation It's really amazing I've been in the audience I'm a writer and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah Like what have I got to say about all this And I was watching Jane Goodall yesterday and I thought it was really great and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees and I thought Wow What if a chimpanzee could talk you know What would it say My first thought was Well you know there's George Bush But then I thought Why be rude to chimpanzees I guess there goes my green card There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa; we're not really talking about African narratives And it's important to make a distinction because if the news is anything to go by 40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite the protest of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress -- continues to prosecute a senseless war So if news is anything to go by the U。S is right there with Zimbabwe right Which it isn't really is it And talking about war my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity It's amazing isn't it The truth is everything we know about America everything Americans come to know about being American isn't from the news I live there We don't go home at the end of the day and think Well I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories It comes from the novels the movies the fashion magazines It comes from popular culture In other words it's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are And this is important to remember because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people through the Sundiata epics of Mali to modern contemporary literature If you want to know about Africa read our literature -- and not just Things Fall Apart because that would be like saying I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America That's very important There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart He says When the Sumerian tablets were first translated they were thought to be business records But what if they were poems and psalms My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body Giraffes are this desire in the dark This is important It's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity The first Igbo Bible was translated from English in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther who was a Yoruba And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language and so they'll say the word igwe and igwe: same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle or iron So God is in heaven surrounded by His angels was translated as -- Igbo And for some reason in Cameroon when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois they chose the Igbo version And I'm not going to give you the patois translation; I'm going to make it standard English Basically it ends up as God is on a bicycle with his angels This is good because language complicates things You know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live and I find that's not true The language actually makes the world in which we live Language is not -- I mean things don't have any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value And language can't be understood in its abstraction It can only be understood in the context of story and everything all of this is story And it's important to remember that because if we don't then we become ahistorical We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here But these are not new to Africa Nigeria got its independence in 1960 The first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in 1922 following the Aba women's market riots In 1967 in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War Dr Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine So you know the thing is to remember that because otherwise 10 years from now we'll be back here trying to tell this story again So what it says to me then is that it's not really -- the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story and that's really what it's all about Let me tell you a Nigerian joke Well it's just a joke anyway So there's Tom Dick and Harry and they're working construction And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it and he goes on this rant about Twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch If she does it again tomorrow I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself And Dick and Harry repeat this The next day Tom opens his lunchbox there's rice so he throws himself off and kills himself and Tom Dick and Harry follow And now the inquest -- you know Tom's wife and Dick's wife are distraught They wished they'd not packed rice But Harry's wife is confused because she said You know Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years This seemingly innocent joke when I heard it as a child in Nigeria was told about Igbo Yoruba and Hausa with the Hausa being Harry So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred My father was educated in Cork in the University of Cork in the '50s In fact every time I read in Ireland people get me all mistaken and they say Oh this is Chris O'Barney from Cork But he was also in Oxford in the '50s and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria my father used to say to me You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you It makes sense now when I think about it because if you'd known my father you would've wanted to poison him too So I was born in 1966 at the beginning of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War and the war ended after three years And I was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels So I had a very inventive teacher a Pakistani Muslim who wanted to teach us about this So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people I mean picture this -- really picture this A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children Story is powerful Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich It makes perfect sense And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams and a Jewish Nazi hunter And it happened over four continents And when the book came out I was heralded as Africa's answer to Frederick Forsyth which is a dubious honor at best But also the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt So at 18 I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria I grew up very privileged and it's important to talk about privilege because we don't talk about it here A lot of us are very privileged I grew up -- servants cars televisions all that stuff My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison and I had no language for it I was completely terrified completely broken and kept trying to find a new language a new way to make sense of all of this Six months after that with no explanation they let me go Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me But I mean I grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me -- millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries In fact we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had All of those are gone We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent: the valuable resource of the imagination In the film Sometimes in April by Raoul Peck Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend -- fellow Rwandan Army officer albeit a Tutsi -- played by Fraser James And Fraser's on his knees arms tied behind his back and he's crying He's sniveling It's a pitiful sight And as we watch it we are ashamed And we want to say to Idris Chop him up Shut him up And as Idris moves Fraser screams Stop Please stop Idris pauses then he moves again and Fraser says Please Please stop And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us; it's the look in Fraser's eyes It's one that says Don't do this And I'm not saying this to save myself although this would be nice I'm doing it to save you because if you do this you will be lost To be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying but to say in that moment as Fraser says to Idris Tell my girlfriend I love her In that moment Fraser says I am lost already but not you 。。 not you This is a redemption we can all aspire to African narratives in the West they proliferate I really don't care anymore I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves -- how as a writer I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent The question is how do I balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing And this is the difficulty that I face I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible As a young middle-class Nigerian activist I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government And I asked millions of people without questioning my right to do so to go up against the government And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed I justified it and I said This is the cost of revolution Have I not myself been imprisoned Have I not myself been beaten It wasn't until later when I was imprisoned again that I understood the real meaning of torture and how easy your humanity can be taken from you for the time I was engaged in war righteous righteous war Excuse me Sometimes I can stand before the world -- and when I say this transformation is a difficult and slow process -- sometimes I can stand before the world and say My name is Chris Abani I have been human six days but only sometimes But this is a good thing It's never going to be easy There are no answers As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth that I had challenged my students in America -- I said You don't know anything about Africa you're all idiots And so they said Tell me about Africa Professor Abani So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa And the truth be told this is it isn't it There are no essential Africans and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from and yet we want to make profound statements about it And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this that we can rise above all of this When I was 10 I read James Baldwin's Another Country and that book broke me Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it Here Jimmy said Here is love all of it The fact that it happens in Another Country takes you quite by surprise My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world: those who can count and those who can't He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity: religious ethnic historical ideological I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation It's called Ode to the Drum and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read Gazelle I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell Weeks ago you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight before you slouched into that grassy hush And now I'm tightening lashes shaped in hide as if around a ribcage shaped like five bowstrings Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum You've been seasoned by wind dusk and sunlight Pressure can make everything whole again Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood your face has been carved five times I have to drive trouble in the hills Trouble in the valley and trouble by the river too There is no palm wine fish salt or calabash Kadoom Kadoom Kadoom Ka-doooom Now I have beaten a song back into you Rise and walk away like a panther Thank you Thank you very much Thank you It's a distinct privilege to be here A few weeks ago I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets This one entered her left hemisphere and knocked out her Broca's area the speech center of her brain And in this session Gabby's working with a speech therapist and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words and you can see her growing more and more devastated until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist And after a few moments her therapist tries a new tack and they start singing together and Gabby starts to sing through her tears and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels and she sings in one descending scale she sings Let it shine let it shine let it shine And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail in this case literally speak Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr Gottfried Schlaug one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy which has become very popular in music therapy now Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences but they could still sing the lyrics to a song whether it was Happy Birthday To You or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage When I was 17 I visited Dr Schlaug's lab and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain -- how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians how music and listening to music could just light up the entire brain from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life trying to choose between music and medicine I had just completed my undergraduate and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard and I had fallen in love with neuroscience I wanted to become a surgeon I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or with children with disfiguring cancers I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor that doctor without borders On the other hand I had played the violin my entire life Music for me was more than a passion It was obsession It was oxygen I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine And that afternoon I had to ask him How was it for you making that decision And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to and that for me medical school could wait but that the violin simply would not And after two more years of studying music I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr Gupta And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic It was my first audition and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week I was offered the position And it was a dream It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family my new musical home But a year later I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s was treated with thorazine at Bellevue and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States as told through the book and the movie The Soloist but I became his friend and I became his violin teacher and I told him that wherever he had his violin and wherever I had mine I would play a lesson with him And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode Playing for Nathaniel the music took on a deeper meaning because now it was about communication a communication where words failed a communication of a message that went deeper than words that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche yet came as a true musical offering from me I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets And at the very core of this crisis of mine I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me where somehow perhaps possibly in a very naive sense I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill But in the end it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change if I wanted to make a difference I already had the perfect instrument to do it that music was the bridge that connected my world and his There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann who said To send light into the darkness of men's hearts such is the duty of the artist And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony bringing the light of music into the very darkest places performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row performing for combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face and she had a palsy she was shaking and she had this gorgeous smile and she said that she had never heard classical music before she didn't think she was going to like it she had never heard a violin before but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine and that nobody ever came to visit them and that for the first time in six years when she heard us play she stopped shaking without medication Suddenly what we're finding with these concerts away from the stage away from the footlights out of the tuxedo tails the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room would never have access to the kind of music that we make Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone the power and beauty of music transcends the E in the middle of our beloved acronym Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner or a symphony by Brahms or chamber music by Beethoven compels us to remember our shared common humanity the deeply communal connected consciousness the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain's right hemisphere And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them And the spark of that beauty the spark of that humanity transforms into hope and we know whether we choose the path of music or of medicine that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities within our audiences if we want to inspire healing from within I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats the Romantic English poet a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry but he died when he was a year older than me And Keats said Beauty is truth and truth beauty That is all ye know on Earth and all ye need to know I've always had a fascination for computers and technology and I made a few apps for the iPhone iPod Touch and iPad I'd like to share a couple with you today My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber which is â â which is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit so I decided to make the app So I went to work programming it and I released it just before the holidays in 2010 A lot of people ask me how did I make these A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also A lot of kids these days like to play games but now they want to make them and it's difficult because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program I mean for soccer you could go to a soccer team For violin you could get lessons for a violin But what if you want to make an app And their parents the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young but not many parents have written apps Where do you go to find out how to make an app Well this is how I approached it This is what I did First of all I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down such as Python C Java etc And then Apple released the iPhone and with it the iPhone software development kit and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me and after playing with the software development kit a little bit I made a couple apps I made some test apps One of them happened to be Earth Fortune and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store and so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store They agreed and now I have apps on the App Store I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family friends teachers and even people at the Apple Store and that's been a huge help to me I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs and I've started an app club at school and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app This is so I can share my experiences with others There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program and some districts have them I'm fortunate enough to be part of one A big challenge is how should the iPads be used and what apps should we put on the iPads So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like When we design the app and we sell it it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations These days students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology So -- -- sorry -- -- so this is a resource to teachers and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future First of all I'd like to create more apps more games I'm working with a third party company to make an app I'd like to get into Android programming and development and I'd like to continue my app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others Thank you Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage Sheryl Sandberg: First time back Nice to see everyone It's always so nice to look out and see so many women It's so not my regular experience as I know anyone else's PM: So when we first started talking about maybe the subject wouldn't be social media which we assumed it would be but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions particularly in the sector of technology and social media But how did that evolve for you as a thought and end up being the TED Talk that you gave SS: So I was really scared to get on this stage and talk about women because I grew up in the business world as I think so many of us did You never talk about being a woman because someone might notice that you're a woman right They might notice Or worse if you say woman people on the other end of the table think you're asking for special treatment or complaining Or worse about to sue them And so I went through -- Right I went through my entire business career and never spoke about being a woman never spoke about it publicly But I also had noticed that it wasn't working I came out of college over 20 years ago and I thought that all of my peers were men and women all the people above me were all men but that would change because your generation had done such an amazing job fighting for equality equality was now ours for the taking And it wasn't Because year after year I was one of fewer and fewer and now often the only woman in a room And I talked to a bunch of people about should I give a speech at TEDWomen about women and they said oh no no It will end your business career You cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman You'll never be taken seriously again But fortunately there were the few the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech and I asked myself the question Mark Zuckerberg might -- the founder of Facebook and my boss -- asks all of us which is what would I do if I wasn't afraid And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't afraid is I would get on the TED stage and talk about women and leadership And I did and survived PM: I would say not only survived I'm thinking of that moment Sheryl when you and I were standing backstage together and you turned to me and you told me a story And I said -- very last minute -- you know you really should share that story SS: Oh yeah PM: What was that story SS: Well it's an important part of the journey So I had -- TEDWomen -- the original one was in D。C -- so I live here so I had gotten on a plane the day before and my daughter was three she was clinging to my leg: Mommy don't go And Pat's a friend and so not related to the speech I was planning on giving which was chock full of facts and figures and nothing personal I told Pat the story I said well I'm having a hard day Yesterday my daughter was clinging to my leg and Don't go And you looked at me and said you have to tell that story I said on the TED stage Are you kidding I'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg And you said yes because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles you have to be honest about how hard it is And I did And I think that's a really important part of the journey The same thing happened when I wrote my book I started writing the book I wrote a first chapter I thought it was fabulous It was chock-full of data and figures I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai tribes and their sociological patterns My husband read it and he was like this is like eating your Wheaties No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's someone -- no one no one will read this book And I realized through the process that I had to be more honest and more open and I had to tell my stories My stories of still not feeling as self-confident as I should in many situations My first and failed marriage Crying at work Felling like I didn't belong there feeling guilty to this day And part of my journey starting on this stage going to Lean In going to the foundation is all about being more open and honest about those challenges so that other women can be more open and honest and all of us can work together towards real equality PM: I think that one of the most striking parts about the book and in my opinion one of the reasons it's hit such a nerve and is resonating around the world is that you are personal in the book and that you do make it clear that while you've observed some things that are very important for other women to know that you've had the same challenges that many others of us have as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and possibly the people who don't believe the same So talk about that process: deciding you'd go public with the private part and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges SS: After I did the TED Talk what happened was -- you know I never really expected to write a book I'm not an author I'm not a writer and it was viewed a lot and it really started impacting people's lives I got this great --- one of the first letters I got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work and she turned it down and she told her best friend she turned it down and her best friend said you really need to watch this TED Talk And so she watched this TED Talk and she went back the next day she took the job she went home and she handed her husband the grocery list And she said I can do this And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't only women in the corporate world even though I did hear from a lot of them and it did impact a lot of them it was also people of all different circumstances There was a doctor I met who was an attending physician at Johns Hopkins and he said that until he saw my TED Talk it never really occurred to him that even though half the students in his med school classes were women they weren't speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds So he started paying attention and as he waited for raised hands he realized the men's hands were up So he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more and it still didn't work So he told everyone no more hand raising I'm cold-calling So he could call evenly on men and women And what he proved to himself was that the women knew the answers just as well or better and he was able to go back to them and tell them that And then there was the woman stay-at-home mom lives in a really difficult neighborhood with not a great school she said that TED Talk -- she's never had a corporate job but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher for her child And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice And I realized that other women and men could find their voice through it which is why I went from the talk to the book PM: And in the book you not only found your voice which is clear and strong in the book but you also share what you've learned -- the experiences of other people in the lessons And that's what I'm thinking about in terms of putting yourself in a -- you became a sort of expert in how you lean in So what did that feel like and become like in your life To launch not just a book not just a best-selling best-viewed talk but a movement where people began to literally describe their actions at work as I'm leaning in SS: I mean I'm grateful I'm honored I'm happy and it's the very beginning So I don't know if I'm an expert or if anyone is an expert I certainly have done a lot of research I have read every study I have pored over the materials and the lessons are very clear Because here's what we know: What we know is that stereotypes are holding women back from leadership roles all over the world It's so striking Lean In is very global I've been all over the world talking about it and -- cultures are so different Even within our own country to Japan to Korea to China to Asia Europe they're so different Except for one thing: gender All over the world no matter what our cultures are we think men should be strong assertive aggressive have voice; we think women should speak when spoken to help others Now we have all over the world women are called bossy There is a word for bossy for little girls in every language there's one It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys because if a little boy leads there's no negative word for it it's expected But if a little girl leads she's bossy Now I know there aren't a lot of men here but bear with me If you're a man you'll have to represent your gender Please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work There's always a few it runs about five percent Okay get ready gentlemen If you're a woman please raise your hand if you've ever been told you're too aggressive at work That is what audiences have said in every country in the world and it's deeply supported by the data Now do we think women are more aggressive than men Of course not It's just that we judge them through a different lens and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work to get results to lead are ones that we think in a man he's a boss and in a woman she's bossy And the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it One of the happiest moments I had in this whole journey is after the book came out I stood on a stage with John Chambers the CEO of Cisco He read the book He stood on a stage with me he invited me in front of his whole management team men and women and he said I thought we were good at this I thought I was good at this And then I read this book and I realized that we -- my company -- we have called all of our senior women too aggressive and I'm standing on this stage and I'm sorry And I want you to know we're never going to do it again PM: Can we send that to a lot of other people that we know SS: And so John is doing that because he believes it's good for his company and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it And so next time you all see someone call a little girl bossy you walk right up to that person big smile and you say That little girl's not bossy That little girl has executive leadership skills PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter SS: Absolutely PM: And you did focus in the book -- and the reason as you said in writing it was to create a dialogue about this I mean let's just put it out there face the fact that women are -- in a time when we have more open doors and more opportunities -- are still not getting to the leadership positions So in the months that have come since the book in which Lean In focused on that and said here are some of the challenges that remain and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves What has changed Have you seen changes SS: Well there's certainly more dialogue which is great But what really matters to me and I think all of us is action So everywhere I go CEOs they're mostly men say to me you're costing me so much money because all the women want to be paid as much as the men And to them I say I'm not sorry at all At all I mean the women should be paid as much as the men Everywhere I go women tell me they ask for raises Everywhere I go women say they're getting better relationships with their spouses asking for more help at home asking for the promotions they should be getting at work and importantly believing it themselves Even little things One of the governors of one of the states told me that he didn't realize that more women were in fact literally sitting on the side of the room which they are and now he made a rule that all the women on his staff need to sit at the table The foundation I started along with the book Lean In helps women or men start circles -- small groups it can be 10 it can be however many you want which meet once a month I would have hoped that by now we'd have about 500 circles That would've been great You know 500 times roughly 10 There are over 12，000 circles in 50 countries in the world PM: Wow that's amazing SS: And these are people who are meeting every single month I met one of them I was in Beijing A group of women they're all about 29 or 30 they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing several of them grew up in very poor rural China These women are 29 they are told by their society that they are left over because they are not yet married and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting is helping them define who they are for themselves What they want in their careers The kind of partners they want if at all I looked at them we went around and introduced ourselves and they all said their names and where they're from and I said I'm Sheryl Sandberg and this was my dream And I kind of just started crying Right which I admit I do Right I've talked about it before But the fact that a woman so far away out in the world who grew up in a rural village who's being told to marry someone she doesn't want to marry can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that and find life on her own terms That's the kind of change we have to hope for PM: Have you been surprised by the global nature of the message Because I think when the book first came out many people thought well this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up They need to look at this anticipate the barriers and recognize them put them out in the open have the dialogue about it but that it's really for women who are that Doing that Pursuing the corporate world And yet the book is being read as you say in rural and developing countries What part of that has surprised you and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part SS: The book is about self-confidence and about equality And it turns out everywhere in the world women need more self-confidence because the world tells us we're not equal to men Everywhere in the world we live in a world where the men get and and women get or I've never met a man who's been asked how he does it all Again I'm going to turn to the men in the audience: Please raise your hand if you've been asked how do you do it all Men only Women women Please raise your hand if you've been asked how you do it all We assume men can do it all slash -- have jobs and children We assume women can't and that's ridiculous because the great majority of women everywhere in the world including the United States work full time and have children And I think people don't fully understand how broad the message is There is a circle that's been started for rescued sex workers in Miami They're using Lean In to help people make the transition back to what would be a fair life really rescuing them from their pimps and using it There are dress-for-success groups in Texas which are using the book for women who have never been to college And we know there are groups all the way to Ethiopia And so these messages of equality -- of how women are told they can't have what men can have -- how we assume that leadership is for men how we assume that voice is for men these affect all of us and I think they are very universal And it's part of what TEDWomen does It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in which is more women more voice more equality PM: If you were invited now to make another TEDWomen talk what would you say that is a result of this experience for you personally and what you've learned about women and men as you've made this journey SS: I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly but I think I can say it more strongly -- I want to say that the status quo is not enough That it's not good enough that it's not changing quickly enough Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book another year of data came out from the U。S Census And you know what we found No movement in the wage gap for women in the United States Seventy-seven cents to the dollar If you are a black woman 64 cents If you are a Latina we're at 54 cents Do you know when the last time those numbers went up 2002 We are stagnating we are stagnating in so many ways And I think we are not really being honest about that for so many reasons It's so hard to talk about gender We shy away from the word feminist a word I really think we need to embrace We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back -- I think I would say in a louder voice we need to get rid of the word bossy and bring back the word feminist because we need it PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in SS: A lot more leaning in PM: Thank you Sheryl Thanks for leaning in and saying yes SS: Thank you One way to change our genes is to make new ones as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown Another is to change our lifestyles And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits When you eat healthier manage stress exercise and love more your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen But more than that your brain gets measurably bigger Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us Now there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells Some of my favorite things like chocolate and tea blueberries alcohol in moderation stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana I'm just the messenger What were we just talking about And other things that can make it worse that can cause you to lose brain cells The usual suspects like saturated fat and sugar nicotine opiates cocaine too much alcohol and chronic stress Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle so you age less quickly Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much Your heart gets more blood flow We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left after only a year become measurably less clogged And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left the blue means no blood flow A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and by extension breast cancer simply by making these changes We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes whereas only nine percent in the comparison group These differences were highly significant Even your sexual organs get more blood flow so you increase sexual potency One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services showing that nicotine which constricts your arteries can cause a heart attack or a stroke but it also causes impotence Half of guys who smoke are impotent How sexy is that Now we're also about to publish a study -- the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer This is what's called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side on the right are different genes And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed -- in effect turning on the good genes the disease-preventing genes turning off the disease-promoting genes And so these findings I think are really very powerful giving many people new hope and new choices And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe that are giving you your genetic profiles are giving some people a sense of Gosh well what can I do about it Well our genes are not our fate and if we make these changes -- they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise we can actually change how our genes are expressed Thank you So I want to talk today about money and happiness which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about either trying to earn them or trying to increase them And a lot of us resonate with this phrase So we see it in religions and self-help books that money can't buy happiness And I want to suggest today that in fact that's wrong I'm at a business school so that's what we do So that's wrong and in fact if you think that you're actually just not spending it right So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it maybe if you spent it differently that might work a little bit better And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier let's think about the ways we usually spend it that don't in fact make us happier We had a little natural experiment So CNN a little while ago wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing This article's about how their lives get ruined So what happens when people win the lottery is number one they spend all the money and go into debt and number two all of their friends and everyone they've ever met find them and bug them for money And it ruins their social relationships in fact So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article readers of the thing And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn't lead to happiness everyone instantly started saying You know what I would do if I won the lottery 。。 and fantasizing about what they'd do And here's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about One person wrote in When I win I'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top And another person wrote I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne This is even worse now: Then I'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else And so many of the comments were exactly of this type where people got money and in fact it made them antisocial So I told you that it ruins people's lives and that their friends bug them It also money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves Well maybe the reason that money doesn't make us happy is that we're always spending it on the wrong things and in particular that we're always spending it on ourselves And we thought I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people So instead of being antisocial with your money what if you were a little more prosocial with your money And we thought let's make people do it and see what happens So let's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves and let's make some people give money away and measure their happiness and see if in fact they get happier So the first way that we did this On one Vancouver morning we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said Do you want to be in an experiment They said Yes We asked them how happy they were and then we gave them an envelope And one of the envelopes had things in it that said By 5:00 pm today spend this money on yourself So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on Other people in the morning got a slip of paper that said By 5:00 pm today spend this money on somebody else Also inside the envelope was money And we manipulated how much money we gave them So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars We let them go about their day They did whatever they wanted to do We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to We called them up at night and asked them What'd you spend it on and how happy do you feel now What did they spend it on Well these are college undergrads so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece People gave money to homeless people Huge effect here of Starbucks So if you give undergraduates five dollars it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can But some people bought a coffee for themselves the way they usually would but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else So the very same purchase just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day People who spent money on other people got happier People who spent money on themselves nothing happened It didn't make them less happy it just didn't do much for them And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter that much So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars In fact it doesn't matter how much money you spent What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves Of course these are undergraduates in Canada -- not the world's most representative population They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries So we went in fact to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment So imagine instead of just people in Canada we said Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people Describe it How happy did it make you Or in Uganda Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that And then we asked them how happy they are again And what we see is sort of amazing because there's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well So for example one guy from Uganda says this He said I called a girl I wished to love They basically went out on a date and he says at the end that he didn't achieve her up till now Here's a guy from Canada Very similar thing I took my girlfriend out for dinner We went to a movie we left early and then went back to her room for 。。 only cake -- just a piece of cake Human universal -- so you spend money on other people you're being nice to them Maybe you have something in mind maybe not But then we see extraordinary differences So look at these two This is a woman from Canada We say Name a time you spent money on somebody else She says I bought a present for my mom I drove to the mall in my car bought a present gave it to my mom Perfectly nice thing to do It's good to get gifts for people that you know Compare that to this woman from Uganda I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria They had no money they went to a clinic and I gave her this money This isn't $10，000 it's the local currency So it's a very small amount of money in fact But enormously different motivations here This is a real medical need literally a life-saving donation Above it's just kind of I bought a gift for my mother What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy which is really quite important So you don't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy You can do small trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this These are only two countries We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness We got data from the Gallup Organization which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately They ask people Did you donate money to charity recently and they ask them How happy are you with your life in general And we can see what the relationship is between those two things Are they positively correlated Giving money makes you happy Or are they negatively correlated On this map green will mean they're positively correlated and red means they're negatively correlated And you can see the world is crazily green So in almost every country in the world where we have this data people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don't give money to charity I know you're all looking at that red country in the middle I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is but in fact it's Central African Republic You can make up stories Maybe it's different there for some reason or another Just below that to the right is Rwanda though which is amazingly green So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself What about your work life which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we're not with the people we know We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing So these are sales teams in Belgium They work in teams; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team Some teams we give people on the team some money for themselves and say Spend it however you want on yourself just like we did with the undergrads in Canada But other teams we say Here's 15 euro Spend it on one of your teammates this week Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them And then we can see well now we've got teams that spend on themselves and we've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that A very silly trivial thing to do but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all that got 15 euro put it in their pocket maybe bought themselves a coffee or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity What we see is that in fact the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves And one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves they put it in their pocket they don't do anything different than they did before You don't get any money from that You actually lose money because it doesn't motivate them to perform any better But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money And I realize that you're probably thinking to yourselves this is all fine but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy and I can't imagine it would work there And basically that if he doesn't show me that it works here I don't believe anything he said And I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams This was a huge criticism that we got to say if you can't show it with dodgeball teams this is all stupid So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them And we did the exact same thing as before So some teams we give people on the team money they spend it on themselves Other teams we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before The teams that we give the money to spend on each other they become different teams and in fact they dominate the league by the time they're done Across all of these different contexts -- your personal life you work life even silly things like intramural sports -- we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself And so I'll just say I think if you think money can't buy happiness you're not spending it right The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that's the way to make yourself happier It's in fact that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead And we luckily have an opportunity for you DonorsChoose。org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools They post projects so they say I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don't have the books or I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don't have a microscope You and I can go on and buy it for them The teacher writes you a thank you note The kids write you a thank you note Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope It's an extraordinary thing Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking again less about How can I spend money on myself and more about If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars what can I do to benefit other people Because ultimately when you do that you'll find that you'll benefit yourself much more Thank you I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal And I come from a long way I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me It's been a tough journey for me traveling the world telling my story in form of a book And also telling it like now And also the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music So I have branded myself as a war child I'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now who have lost her children There is no newspaper to cover her pain and what she wants to change in this society And I'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write Or there is no Internet like Facebook MySpace YouTube for them to talk Also one thing that kept me pushing this story this painful stories out the dreams I have sometimes is like the voices of the dead that I have seen would tell me Don't give up Keep on going Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it because I didn't know what I was putting myself into Well I was born in the most difficult time when my country was at war I saw my village burned down The world that meant a lot to me I saw it vanish in my face I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five My mother was claimed by the war My brothers and sisters were scattered And up to now me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him Seeing people die every day my mother crying it's like I was raised in a violence And that made me call myself a war child And not only that when I was eight I became a child soldier I didn't know what was the war for But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head When I went to the training camp I say I want to kill as many Muslims and as many Arabs as possible The training wasn't easy but that was the driving force because I wanted to revenge for my family I wanted to revenge for my village Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims wasn't the Arabs It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system and using religion to get what they want to get out of us which is the oil the diamond the gold and the land So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose: should I continue to hate or let it go So I happened to forgive Now I sing music with the Muslims I dance with them I even had a movie out called War Child funded by Muslim people So that pain has gone out But my story is huge So I'm just going to go into a different step now which is easier for me I'm going to give you poem called Forced to Sin which is from my album War Child I talk about my story One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 And only 16 people survived that journey So I hope you're going to hear this My dreams are like torment My every moment Voices in my brain of friends that was slain Friends like Lual who died by my side of starvation In the burning jungle and the desert plain Next was I but Jesus heard my cry As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade he gave me comfort We used to raid villages stealing chickens goats and sheeps anything we could eat I knew it was rude but we needed food And therefore I was forced to sin forced to sin to make a living forced to sin to make a living Sometimes you gotta lose to win Never give up Never give in Left home at the age of seven One year later live with an AK-47 by my side Slept with one eye open wide Run duck play dead and hide I've seen my people die like flies But I've never seen a dead body at least one that I've killed But still as I wonder I won't go under Guns barking like lightning and thunder As a child so young and tender Words I can't forget I still remember I saw sergeant command raising his hand no retreat no surrender I carry the banner of the trauma War child child without a mama still fighting in the saga Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama No sit or stop as I reach for the top I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop I'm on a fight day and night Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right It's like I'm living a dream First time I'm feeling like a human being Ah The children of Darfur Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that I'm fighting for Left home Don't even know the day I'll ever return My country is war-torn Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns So many people die that I don't even cry no more Ask God question what am I here for And why are my people poor And why why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write I was learning how to fight I ate snails vultures rabbits snakes and anything that had life I was ready to eat I know it's a shame But who is to be blamed That's my story shared in the form of a lesson Thank you What energized me and kept me going is the music I do I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy So the music had been my therapy for me It's been where I actually see heaven where I can be happy where I can be a child again in dances through music So one thing I know about music: music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system your mind your heart influence your soul and your spirit and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg without even wanting to do it And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color You know if you fall in love with a frog that's it One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then I hated the people in the north But I don't know why I don't hate their music So we party and dance to their music And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music But I had this question So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is So what's happening here I've been in a painful journey Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner I don't eat breakfast No lunch And I've done a campaign called Lose to Win Where I'm losing so that I could win the battle that I'm fighting now So my breakfast my lunch I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan And I'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home people eat one meal a day Here I am in the West I choose not to So in my village now kids there they normally listen to BBC or any radio and they are waiting to know the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school And so I made a commitment I say I'm gonna not eat my breakfast I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month but I've been humbled So it's taken me 232 days And I said No stop until we get it And like it's been done on Facebook MySpace The people are giving three dollars The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents Somebody donated 20 cents online I don't know how they did it But that moved me And so the importance of education to me is what I'm willing to die for I'm willing to die for this because I know what it can do to my people Education enlighten your brain give you so many chances and you're able to survive As a nation we have been crippled For so many years we have fed on aid You see a 20-years-old 30-years-old families in a refugee camps They only get the food that drops from the sky from the U。N So these people you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid If anybody want to help us this is what we need Give us tools Give the farmers tools It's rain Africa is fertile They can grow the crops Invest in education Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa They will die soon But if you invest in education then we'll be able to change Africa That's what I'm asking So in order to do that I founded a charter called Gua Africa where we put kids in school And now we have a couple in university We have like 40 kids ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support And I said I'm going to put it in practice And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things That's what I want to do to change to make a difference in the world Well now my time is going so I want to sing a song But I'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here I'm gonna sing this song just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference She came to my country and saw the importance of education She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women educating them educating the children so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA And she rescued over 150 child soldiers One of them happened to be me now And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma Audience: Yes Emmanuel Jal: All right This one goes to Emma McCune Angel to rescue came one afternoon I'm here because you rescued me I'm proud to carry your legacy Thank you Bless you R。I。P What would I be Me If Emma never rescued me What would I be What would I be Me Another starving refugee What would I be What would I be Me If Emma never rescued me Yeah Yeah Yeah You would have seen my face on the telly Fat hungry belly Flies in my eyes head too big for my size Just another little starving child Running around in Africa born to be wild Praise God praise the Almighty for sending an angel to rescue me I got a reason for being on this Earth 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth Now that I got a chance to stand my ground I'm gonna run over mountains leaps and bounds I ain't an angel hope I'll be one soon And if I am I wanna be like Emma McCune Me What would I be Me If Emma never rescued me What would I be What would I be Me Another starving refugee What would I be What would I be Me If Emma never rescued me Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah I would have probably died from starvation Or some other wretched disease I would have grown up with no education Just another refugee I stand here because somebody cared I stand here because somebody dared I know there is a lot of Emmas out there Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child What would I be Me If Emma never rescued me What would I be What would I be Another starving refugee I remember the time when I was small When I couldn't read or write at all Now I'm all grown up I got my education The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one How I prayed for this day to come And I pray that the world find wisdom To give the poor in need some assistance Instead of putting up resistance yeah Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this It ain't gonna happen They're all sitting on they asses Popping champagne and sponging off the masses Coming from a refugee boy-soldier But I still got my dignity I gotta say it again If Emma never rescued me I'd be a corpse on the African plain Is there anybody who's here in the back some love Big scream for Emma everybody Yeah I'm gonna get crazy now What would I be If Emma never rescued me What would I be Another starving refugee What would I be If Emma never rescued me Yeah Yeah Yeah I would have probably died from starvation Or some other wretched disease I would have grown up with no education Just another refugee Thank you Go save a life of a child I'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life 15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades Now as many of you may remember the Red Brigades was a terrorist Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers They sat in silence through their trails waving occasionally at family and friends In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk and tell their story And I was one of those people When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name In particular one person had put it forward She was my childhood friend She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization Naturally I didn't know that until the day she was arrested In fact I read it in the newspaper At the time of the phone call I just had a baby I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist and why she'd never tried to recruit me So this is exactly what I did Now I found the answer very quickly I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist My friend on the other hand she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders She also embraced violence Because she believed that the only way to unblock what at the time was known as a blocked democracy Italy a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle At the same time while I was interviewing the Red Brigades I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology but actually was ruled by economics They were constantly short of cash They were constantly searching for cash Now contrary to what many people believe terrorism is actually a very expensive business I'll give you an idea In the 1970s the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars This is roughly between 100 and 150 million today Now you know if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money But this also explains why when I was interviewing the Red Brigades and then later on other arms organizations including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology or politics Because they had no idea The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership which generally is never more than five to seven people All the others do day in and day out is search for money Once for example I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades It was a psychiatrist He loved sailing He was a really keen sailor And he had this beautiful boat And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing every summer back and forth from Lebanon where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee which went to fund their organization So because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms all of the sudden I thought maybe there is something here Maybe there is a link a commercial link between one organization and another one But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti the head of the Red Brigades the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro Italian former prime minister that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy And as we were eating I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist This guy thought in the same way I did So I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism Naturally nobody wanted to fund my research In fact I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy You know that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money thinking about the economics of terrorism So in the end I took a decision that in retrospect did change my life I sold my company and funded the research myself And what I discovered is this parallel reality another international economic system which runs parallel to our own which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed step by step the evolution of our own system of our Western capitalism And there are three main stages The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism The second one is the privatization of terrorism And the third of course is the globalization of terrorism So state sponsor of terrorism feature of the Cold War This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy along the periphery of the sphere of influence fully funding arms organizations A mix of legal and illegal activities is used So the link between crime and terror is established very early on And here is the best example the Contras in Nicaragua created by the CIA legally funded by the U。S Congress illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation for example the Iran-Contra Affair Then comes the late 1970s early '80s and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism So they gain independence from the sponsor and start funding themselves Now again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities So Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bekáa Valley which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria And the IRA which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland did exactly the same thing So every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing actually was funding the IRA But the great change came of course with globalization and deregulation This is when arms organization were able to link up also financially with each other But above all they started to do serious business with the world of crime And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda This is an organization that can raise money across border But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country Now deregulation also brought back rogue economics So what is rogue economics Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history It comes back at times of great transformation globalization being one of those transformations It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us It has happened before in history It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire It has happened with Industrial Revolution And it actually happened again with the fall of the Berlin wall Now I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime terror and illegal economy before 9-11 And it is a staggering 1。5 trillion dollars It is trillions it's not billions This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom soon will be more considering where this country is going Now until 9-11 the bulk of all this money flew into the U。S economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U。S dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States The entry point of course of most of this money were the off-shore facilities So this was a vital injection of cash into the U。S economy Now when I went to look at the figures of the U。S money supply the U。S money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars which of course reflects the growth of the economy So when I went to look at those figures I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States never to come back These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers in cash of course These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy So you see what is the relationship The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world What does it mean That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world This privilege is called seigniorage No other country can do that All the other countries for example the United Kingdom can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders So here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime terror and illegal economy and our economy The U。S in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror illegal and criminal economy This is how close we are with this world Now this situation changed of course after 9-11 because George Bush launched the War on Terror Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act Now many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance And it is in fact an anti-money-laundering legislation What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U。S bank and U。S。-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars and the U。S economy It also gave the U。S monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world Now you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking All the bankers said to their clients Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else Now the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business and of course for investment And this is what people did Nobody wants the U。S monetary authority to check their relationship to monitor their relationship with their clientele The same thing happened of course in the world of crime and terror People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe Why did this happen This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation It was introduced only in the United States And it was introduced only for the U。S dollars In Europe a similar legislation was not introduced So within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world So this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror and our own life So why did I tell you this story I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family You got to question everything that is told to you including what I just told you today This is the only way for you to step into the dark side and have a look at it And believe me it's going to be scary It's going to be frightful but it's going to enlighten you And above all it's not going to be boring I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again not just represent things This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project I and my firm have ever been involved in I was thrilled to get it I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet I thought it represented the importance of the architect I stayed thrilled until I got home threw the helmet onto my bed fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription Now I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today We are for decorative purposes only Now who do we have to blame We can only blame ourselves Over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious And we architects are cowards So as we have faced liability we have stepped back and back and unfortunately where there is liability guess what there is: power So eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here Now what did we do We're cowards but we're smart cowards And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture And we announced Hey architecture it's over here in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create Now something else happened And that's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided but we would merely write it off as merely execution Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act and nine months of gestation and God forbid 24 hours of child labor is merely execution So what do we architects need to do We need to stitch back creation and execution And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects Now if we do this I believe we can go back 50 years and start reinjecting agency social engineering back into architecture Now there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do like managing contracts learning how to write contracts understanding procurement processes understanding the time value of money and cost estimation But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process into three very pedantic statements The first is: Take core positions with your client I know it's shocking right that architecture would actually say that The second position is: Actually take positions Take joint positions with your client This is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency But it has to be done together And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken Now I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control You do not know what the end result is But I promise you with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of Alright now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches This is the modus operandi that we have today We roll 120-foot Spartan i。e our vision up to our clients' gates of Troy And we don't understand why they won't let us in Right Well how about instead of doing that we roll up to the gates something they want Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears So we can change the metaphor Let's call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate get through the constraints of a project At which point you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel the agency the vision And if you do that you do that responsibly I believe that instead of delivering Spartans you can deliver maidens And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints Now with that in mind I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room-- well maybe not dear but certainly close to many people in this room And that's a project that is just about to open next week the new home for the Dallas Theater Center the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre Now I'm going to present it on the same terms: issue position and architectural manifestation Now the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York Chicago and Seattle And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership But it also had to do with something rather unusual and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building When you're on Broadway you cannot tear the proscenium down This building when an artistic director wanted to do a Cherry Orchard and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage they brought a backhoe in and they simply dug the hole Well that's exciting And you can start to get the best artistic directors scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere So the first position we took was Hey we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company The second issue is a nuance of the first And that's that the company and the building was multiform That meant that they were able to perform as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium thrust flat floor arena traverse you name it All they needed was labor Well something happened In fact something happened to all institutions around the world It started to become hard to raise operational costs operational budgets So they stopped having inexpensive labor And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium So the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided the ability to move between stage configurations had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs Alright Affordably The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house At first blush you think Hey it's crazy what could you possibly gain We created what we like to call superfly Now superfly the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower and you smear them across flytower and auditorium Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional And you can drill cut nail screw paint and replace with a minimum of cost But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief So the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas with your real life he or she can do so Now in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable In fact it really was the clients who had to do it They had to make a decision based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture and one-third infrastructure to actually the inverse two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept But based on the positions they took the educated leap of faith to do so And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine Now that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences Meaning: The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects because they say the first thing they have to do the first five minutes of any show is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture So in fact there is the building there is what we call the draw You're going down into our lobby go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits whether you like them or not up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance into the interior of the auditorium And here is the fruition of that in actuality These are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside in or from the inside out performers or audience alike Now imagine what that could be I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry a first act in thrust an intermission in Greek a second act in arena and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits Now that I would say is architecture performing It is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director I'll go through the three basic configurations This is the flat floor configuration You notice that there is no proscenium the balconies have been raised up there are no seats the floor in the auditorium is flat The first configuration is easy to understand The balconies come down you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage and the seats come in The third configuration is a little harder to understand Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space And some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen I'll do it again so you can see it There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium And there it is in the thrust configuration In order to do that again we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks And they told us one important thing: You shall not beta-test Meaning nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it But they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift Now if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey that would be bad If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night that would also be bad And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor lifting it up spinning it changing the rake taking it back to flat floor changing the rake again In essence you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating at will Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration The proscenium also As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium And ultimately up in the flytower the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur As I said all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration But we got this other benefit and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed This is a trompe l'oeil Actually this is not a curtain These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify if you chose the operations of the theater going on behind rehearsals and so forth But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance Now if I'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together Effectively you would have something like this You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber: Aida their elephants you can bring the elephants in You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa Dallas to the auditorium You'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession allow people to come in and out for an intermission or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance As I said all the balconies can move but they can also be disappeared completely The proscenium can fly You can bring large objects into the chamber itself But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure is something that is represented by this And again this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built but at least suggests the ideas This building has the ability in short order to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out Now if there is anyone here from American Airlines please consider doing your Christmas party here That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums That's an enormous benefit So the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic light-controlled sound-controlled great acoustics great intimacy Shakespeare but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it Here it is in a flat floor configuration The theater has been going through its kind of paces Here it is in an end stage configuration It's actually beautiful There was a rock band We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them It was very unusual Here it is in a thrust configuration And last but not least you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem I'm going to show you a brief time lapse As I said this can be done with only two people and with a minimum amount of time This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it So in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around And think of it being done with just a few people Again just a couple people are required I promise Et voila So just in conclusion a few shots This is the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater There it is at night And last but not least the entire AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with And we took positions with them and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually Thank you The year is 1800 A curious little invention is being talked about It's called a microscope What it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye Soon comes the medical discovery that many of these lifeforms are actually causes of terrible human diseases Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup not very far from here This is from London Fast forward 200 years We still have this monster soup around and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt Just for malaria itself there are a million deaths a year and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections Now it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters You take a stain like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa and a microscope and you look at them They all have faces Why is that so that Alex in Kenya Fatima in Bangladesh Navjoot in Mumbai and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick And that's primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach And remember that number: one billion The problem lies with the microscope itself Even though the pinnacle of modern science research microscopes are not designed for field testing Neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all They are heavy bulky really hard to maintain and cost a lot of money This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing T。B in his ashram in Sevagram in India Two of my students Jim and James traveled around India and Thailand starting to think about this problem a lot We saw all kinds of donated equipment We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes So what is a Foldscope A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope a platform for fluorescence bright-field polarization projection all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper So now you think how is that possible I'm going to show you some examples here and we will run through some of them It starts with a single sheet of paper What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright-field and fluorescence microscope So there are three stages: There is the optical stage the illumination stage and the mask-holding stage And there are micro optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself What you do is you take it on and just like you are playing like a toy which it is I tab it off and I break it off This paper has no instructions and no languages There is a code a color code embedded that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope When it's done it looks something like this has all the functionalities of a standard microscope just like an XY stage a place where a sample slide could go for example right here We didn't want to change this because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years and many health workers are actually used to this So this is what changes but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases You pop this in There is an XY stage and then there is a focusing stage which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps So what's really interesting about this object and my students hate when I do this but I'm going to do this anyway is these are rugged devices I can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it And they last even though they're designed from a very flexible material like paper Another fun fact is this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool but here in this envelope I have 30 different foldscopes of different configurations all in a single folder And I'm going to pick one randomly This one it turns out is actually designed specifically for malaria because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this So up till now you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups So what I would like to do is if we could dim the lights please it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn -- go to the back of the wall -- and just project and this way you will see exactly what I would see What you're looking at -- This is a cross-section of a compound eye and when I'm going to zoom in closer right there I am going through the z-axis You actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross-section pattern Another example one of my favorite insects I love to hate this one is a mosquito and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens Right there All from the simple setup that I actually described So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer So it turns out they're waterproof and -- right here is just fluorescent water and I don't know if you can actually see this This also shows you how the projection scope works You get to see the beam the way it's projected and bent Can we get the lights back on again So I'm quickly going to show you since I'm running out of time in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs And what this allows us to do is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy which we call use-and-throw microscopy I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in Here is a sheet of paper This is when we were thinking about the idea This is an A4 sheet of paper These are the three stages that you actually see And the optical components if you look at the inset up on the right we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs so it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself So that's where the lenses go There are some light sources And essentially in the end all the parts line up because of origami because of the fact that origami allows us micron-scale precision of optical alignment So even though this looks like a simple toy the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated So here is another obvious thing that we would do typically if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself There it is and it survives So for us the next step actually is really finishing our field trials We are starting at the end of the summer We are at a stage where we'll be making thousands of microscopes That would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place We've started collecting data for malaria Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves And I want to leave you with this picture I had not anticipated this before but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health What are the tools that we're actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow I would love for them to be able to just print out a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets Thank you About a year and a half ago Stephen Lawler who also gave a talk here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort In the past two and a half we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to So the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning which if you're familiar at all with Seadragon that's where it comes from Mapping is of course not just about cartography it's also about imagery So as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city all the facades Now we see this space this three-dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out and map's directions are really just one of them If you click on this you'll see some of the ones that we've put out just in the past couple of months since we've launched So for example a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs It's wonderful But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff So we see the imagery of course not stopping at the sky These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made I'm not going to dive into them either but photosynths are integrated into the map Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well And so when you fly down -- Thank you When you fly down to the ground and you see this kind of panoramic imagery the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above so if I click on something to get a closer view of it then the fact that that transition looks as it does is a function of all of that geometry all of that 3D understanding behind this model Now I'll show you a fun app that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr This takes Flickr georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery so -- I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up but -- But notice -- this is of course a popular tourist site and there are lots of photos around here and these photos are all taken at different times So this one was taken around five So that's the Flickr photo that's our imagery So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating in a very deep way into the map itself Thank you There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them of course is time travel And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well But what's cool about this is that not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users but it also is the foundation for augmented reality and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment Now I just made a transition indoors That's also interesting OK notice there's now a roof above us We're inside the Pike Place Market And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera so we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars but we're also imaging inside And from here we're able to do the same sorts of registration not only of still images but also of video So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening OK All right guys are you there All right I'm hitting it I'm punching play I'm live All right There we go So these are our friends in Pike Place Market the lab So they're broadcasting this live OK George can you pan back over to the corner market Because I want to show points of interest No no The other way Yeah yeah back to the corner back to the corner I don't want to see you guys yet OK OK back to the corner back to the corner back to the corner OK never mind What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way if you're actually on the spot you can think about this -- this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality What the hell are you guys -- oh sorry We're doing two different -- OK I'm hanging up now We're doing two different things here One of them is to take that real 。。 All right let me just take a moment and thank the team They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside And while I walk outside I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence but you can equally well use this on the spot for augmented reality When you use it on the spot it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you So here we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it That was being broadcast by the way on a 4G network from the market All right and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years And that's Curtis Wong WorldWide Telescope So we're going to head over to the dumpsters where it's traditional after a long day at the market to go out for a break but also stare up at the sky This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time If we scrub the time then we can see how the sky will look at different times and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky maybe change the date I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon So this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth All right now I've overrun my time so I've got to stop Thank you all very much I love trees and I'm very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and Sundays usually I'd go there with my wife and now with my four-year-old and we'd climb in the trees we'd play hide and seek The second school I was at had big trees too had a fantastic tulip tree I think it was the biggest in the country and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it around the playing fields One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked; I was abused; and this came out of the blue Now the reason I say that because afterwards I was thinking -- well I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed; I felt ashamed but mainly -- mainly I felt powerless And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called Veronica who came from Chile and we were on a human rights tour and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured and from my very privileged position this was the only reference point that I had And it was an amazing learning experience because for me human rights have been something in which I had you know a part-time interest but mainly it was something that happened to other people over there But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and as you know he's a great singer but he's a magnificent hustler and -- -- a very hard guy to say no to and he was saying you know just after I'd done the Biko song we're going to do a tour for Amnesty you have to be on it and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people who'd watched their family being shot in front of them who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before So I got involved with this tour which was for Amnesty and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle I didn't do it as well but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour Sting Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty and it was an amazing experience And once again I got an extraordinary education and it was the first time really that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries and these human rights stories became very physical and again I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably But the thing that really amazed me that I had no idea was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience your story denied buried and forgotten And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours and there was a decision then -- well we made a proposal for a couple of years about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists It didn't really get anywhere and then the Rodney King incident happened and people thought OK if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time depending who you are then you can actually start doing something and campaigning and being heard and telling people about what's going on So WITNESS was started in '92 and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries And we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and in fact I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda and although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday this one isn't quite so good In the north of Uganda there are something like 1。5 million internally displaced people people who are not refugees in another country but because of the civil war which has been going on for about 20 years they have nowhere to live And 20，000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the -- now what's it called I forget the name of the of the army -- it's Lord's Resistance Army I believe -- but the government also doesn't have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video Life in the camp is never simple Even today life is difficult We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp 。。 still exists back home Text: Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda When we were at home it was Kony's rebel soldiers disturbing us At first we were safe in the camp But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road asking where we'd been Evelyn and I hid behind my mother Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down so we sat down The other soldier also came Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me The other one carried Evelyn aside The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession They kept telling us Tell the truth as they beat us They insisted that I was lying At that moment they fired and shot off my fingers I fell They ran to join the others 。。 leaving me for dead Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986 Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession to punish coerce or intimidate Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil In my country it was -- we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis; we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport and he told me a story that in the middle of the night 4 a。m。 he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots and that may or may not be true -- I didn't think he was a liar though And I think if we look around the world as well as the polar ice caps melting human rights which have been fought for for many hundreds of years in some cases are also eroding very fast and that is something that we need to take a look at and maybe start campaigning for I mean here too one of our partners was at Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed and it's much -- much -- I think more humane methods are being looked at how you should lock up young kids and that's questionable to start off And as the story of Mr Morales just down the road excuse me Mr Gabriel would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit No not at all no problem take your time But this surely whoever that man is whatever he's done this is cruel and unusual punishment Anyway WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras and I'd like to show you just a little more of that Thank you Text: You can say a jury is corrupt You can say a person is lying You can say you don't trust newspapers But you can't say what you just saw never happened Help WITNESS give cameras to the world Shoot a video; expose injustice; reveal the truth; show us what's wrong with the world; and maybe we can help make it right WITNESS All the video you have just seen was recorded by human rights groups working with WITNESS PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation -- in a sense the small portable DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world so that groups can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively but now we have the wonderful possibility which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us And so the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort has a chance of getting their story uploaded being seen being watched that they really know that they can be heard that there would be a giant website maybe a little like Google Earth and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going for the world's inhabitants In a way what this technology is allowing is really that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up for the first time and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture -- if we can move that into these sort of fields I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways There could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground reaching for the light and growing strong just like a tree Thank you My journey to become a polar specialist photographing specializing in the polar regions began when I was four years old when my family moved from Southern Canada to Northern Baffin Island up by Greenland There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people where we were one of three non-Inuit families And in this community we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers obviously radio We didn't even have a telephone All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit playing The snow and the ice were my sandbox and the Inuit were my teachers And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it I'd like to share with you for just two minutes only some images a cross-section of my work to the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile Have You Ever I don't know why National Geographic has done this they've never done this before but they're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet National Geographic doesn't do this so I'm very excited to be able to share this with you And what these images are -- you'll see them at the start of the slide show -- there's only about four images -- but it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest It's pure white but it's not a polar bear It's a spirit bear or a Kermode bear There are only 200 of these bears left They're more rare than the panda bear I sat there on the river for two months without seeing one I thought my career's over I proposed this stupid story to National Geographic What in the heck was I thinking So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life after I was a photographer because they were going to fire me Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures not excuses And after two months of sitting there -- one day thinking that it was all over this incredible big white male came down right beside me three feet away from me and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it And then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream of walking around with this bear through the forest He went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep And I actually got to sleep within three feet of him just in the forest and photograph him So I'm very excited to be able to show you those images and a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions Please enjoy Brandi Carlile: Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods And everything there feels just as it should You're part of the life there You're part of something good If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods Ooh ooh ooh ooh If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods Have you ever stared into a starry sky Lying on your back you're asking why What's the purpose I wonder who am I If you've ever stared into a starry sky Ooh ooh ooh ooh Aah ah aah Ah oh oh ah ah oh oh Have you ever stared into a starry sky Have you ever been out walking in the snow Tried to get back where you were before You always end up Not knowing where to go If you've ever been out walking in the snow Ooh ooh ooh ooh Aah ah aah ah aah Ah ah oh ah ah oh ah Oh ah ah ah Ah ah oh ah ah oh oh If you'd ever been out walking you would know Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much The show's not over My clock is ticking Okay let's stop Thank you very much I appreciate it We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level And in fact scientists were originally saying sea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years then they said 50 years Now they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years And what does that mean After a while of reading this in the news it just becomes news You glaze over with it And what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this And I want people to understand and get the concept that if we lose ice we stand to lose an entire ecosystem Projections are that we could lose polar bears; they could become extinct in the next 50 to 100 years And there's no better sexier more beautiful charismatic megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on Polar bears are amazing hunters This was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores There was no ice around But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it And this bear swam out to that seal -- 800 lb bearded seal -- grabbed it swam back and ate it And he was so full he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as I approached him -- about 20 feet away -- to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal And as he ate he was so full -- he probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly -- and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth So as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive but it's the ice that's disappearing We're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic When I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago we never found dead bears And in the last four or five years we're finding dead bears popping up all over the place We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out I found a couple in Norway last year We're seeing them on the ice These bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice Here's a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice which is great for them; they're safe at this point They're not going to die of hypothermia They're going to get to land But unfortunately 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem These ringed seals these are the fatsicles of the Arctic These little fat dumplings 150-pound bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear And they're not like the harbor seals that you have here These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice They give birth inside the ice and they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice And here's a picture of sick ice This is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old And what scientists didn't predict is that as this ice melts these big pockets of black water are forming and they're grabbing the sun's energy and accelerating the melting process And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea The visibility's 600 ft。; we're on our safety lines; the ice is moving all over the place I wish I could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive But what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner In that one single piece of ice you have 300 species of microorganisms And in the spring when the sun returns to the ice it forms the phytoplankton grows under that ice and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed and then you get the zoo plankton feeding on all that life So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden It acts like the soil in a garden It's an inverted garden Losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden Here's me in my office I hope you appreciate yours This is after an hour under the ice I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen; I can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet And I've come up and all I wanted to do was get out of the water After an hour in these conditions it's so extreme that when I go down almost every dive I vomit into my regulator because my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over I get to hand my camera to my assistant and I'm looking up at him and I'm going Woo Woo Woo Which means Take my camera And he thinks I'm saying Take my picture So we had this little communication breakdown But it's worth it I'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales bowhead whales and narwhals and polar bears and leopard seals today but this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made I dropped down in this ice hole just through that hole that you just saw and I looked up under the underside of the ice and I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo I got very nervous -- no rope no safety line the whole world is moving around me -- and I thought I'm in trouble But what happened is that the entire underside was full of these billions of amphipods and copepods moving around and feeding on the underside of the ice giving birth and living out their entire life cycle This is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic right here And when you have low productivity in this in ice the productivity in copepods go down This is a bowhead whale Supposedly science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now This very whale right here could be over 250 years old This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution It could have survived 150 years of whaling And now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North because of the lives that we're leading in the South Narwhals these majestic narwhals with their eight-foot long ivory tusks don't have to be here; they could be out on the open water But they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe catch a breath because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod And the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods Alright my favorite part When I'm on my deathbed I'm going to remember one story more than any other Even though that spirit bear moment was powerful I don't think I'll ever have another experience like I did with these leopard seals Leopard seals since the time of Shackleton have had a bad reputation They've got that wryly smile on their mouth They've got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary And tragically in 2003 a scientist was taken down and drowned and she was being consumed by a leopard seal And people were like We knew they were vicious We knew they were And so people love to form their opinions And that's when I got a story idea: I want to go to Antarctica get in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can and give them a fair shake -- find out if they really are these vicious animals or if they're misunderstood So this is that story Oh and they also happen to eat happy feet As a species as humans we like to say penguins are really cute therefore leopard seals eat them so leopard seals are ugly and bad It doesn't work that way The penguin doesn't know it's cute and the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous This is just the food chain unfolding They're also big They're not these little harbor seals They are 12 ft long a thousand pounds And they're also curiously aggressive You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon The boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go So after five days of crossing the Drake Passage -- isn't that beautiful After five days of crossing the Drake Passage we have finally arrived at Antarctica I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals I have never seen one So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat and there's this monstrous leopard seal And even in his voice he goes That's a bloody big seal ya And this seal is taking this penguin by the head and it's flipping it back and forth And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out so it can eat the meat off the bones and then it goes off and gets another one And so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin came under the boat the Zodiac starting hitting the hull of the boat And we're trying to not fall in the water And we sit down and that's when Goran said to me This is a good seal ya It's time for you to get in the water And I looked at Goran and I said to him Forget that But I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter F But he was right He scolded me out and said This is why we're here And you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic And now you've got to deliver And you can't publish excuses So I had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but I had such such dry mouth And my legs were just trembling I couldn't feel my legs I put my flippers on I could barely part my lips I put my snorkel in my mouth and I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water And this was the first thing she did She came racing up to me engulfed my whole camera -- and her teeth are up here and down here -- but Goran before I had gotten in the water had given me amazing advice He said If you get scared you close your eyes ya and she'll go away So that's all I had to work with at that point But I just started to shoot these pictures So she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed She went off she got a penguin She stopped about 10 feet away from me and she sat there with this penguin the penguin's flapping and she let's it go The penguin swims toward me takes off She grabs another one She does this over and over And it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin Why else would she release these penguins at me And after she did this four or five times she swam by me with this dejected look on her face You don't want to be too anthropomorphic but I swear that she looked at me like This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean So realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins she'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me bobbing like this and she'd let them go This didn't work I was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding because I was crying underwater just because it was so amazing And so that didn't work So then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this And she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me This went on for four days This just didn't happen a couple of times And then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins Now I've got four or five penguins floating around my head and I'm just sitting there shooting away And she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like Are you for real Because she can't believe I can't eat this penguin Because in her world you're either breeding or you're eating -- and I'm not breeding so 。。 And then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head She was trying to force-feed me She's pushing me around She's trying to force-feed my camera which is every photographer's dream And she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face She would I think let me know that I was going to starve But yet she didn't stop She would not stop trying to feed me penguins And on the last day with this female where I thought I had pushed her too far I got nervous because she came up to me she rolled over on her back and she did this deep guttural jackhammer sound this gokgokgokgok And I thought she's about to bite She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me and she did that to threat display She chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me That wasn't the only seal I got in the water with I got in the water with 30 other leopard seals and I never once had a scary encounter They are the most remarkable animals I've ever worked with and the same with polar bears And just like the polar bears these animals depend on an icy environment I get emotional Sorry It's a story that lives deep in my heart and I'm proud to share this with you And I'm so passionate about it Anybody want to come with me to Antarctica or the Arctic I'll take you; let's go We've got to get the story out now Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Thank you Thanks very much Thank you Don't talk to strangers You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends family schools and the media for decades It's a norm It's a social norm But it's a special kind of social norm because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to Don't talk to strangers says Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you Stick with the people you know Stick with people like you How appealing is that It's not really what we do is it when we're at our best When we're at our best we reach out to people who are not like us because when we do that we learn from people who are not like us My phrase for this value of being with not like us is strangeness and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world strangers are quite frankly not the point The point that we should be worried about is how much strangeness are we getting Why strangeness Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data and data turns our social relations into digital relations and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness a sense of discovery a sense of surprise and unpredictability Why not strangers Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries They belong to a world of people I know versus people I don't know and in the context of my digital relations I'm already doing things with people I don't know The question isn't whether or not I know you The question is what can I do with you What can I learn with you What can we do together that benefits us both I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future The economies of the future depend on that Our social lives in the future depend on that The threat to worry about isn't strangers The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness Now 20th-century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s the creator of the small-world experiments which became later popularized as six degrees of separation made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps His point was that strangers are out there We can reach them There are paths that enable us to reach them Mark Granovetter Stanford sociologist in 1973 in his seminal essay The Strength of Weak Ties made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks these strangers are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties the people closest to us He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us these strong ties in our lives actually have a homogenizing effect on us They produce sameness My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives what kinds of new routines are possible We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses and to make them available to people we don't know Whether it's our clothes whether it's our cars whether it's our bikes whether it's our books or music we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met And we concluded a very important insight which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change so do their relations with other people And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am of what I've already done Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations Categories like friends and family and contacts and colleagues don't tell me anything about my actual relations A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance where at any given point in time with any single person I am both close and distant from that individual all as a function of what I need to do right now People aren't close or distant People are always a combination of the two and that combination is constantly changing What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now that enables me to find the sources of intimacy of discovery and of inspiration that I need right now Strangeness is not about meeting strangers It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today but also by organizations organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations We have to change the norms We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers How might we think differently about our relations with people How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people How might we think differently about our relations with technologies things that effectively become social participants in their own right The range of digital relations is extraordinary In the context of this broad range of digital relations safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation Thank you For a long time there was me and my body Me was composed of stories of cravings of strivings of desires of the future Me was trying not to be an outcome of my violent past but the separation that had already occurred between me and my body was a pretty significant outcome Me was always trying to become something somebody Me only existed in the trying My body was often in the way Me was a floating head For years I actually only wore hats It was a way of keeping my head attached It was a way of locating myself I worried that if I took my hat off I wouldn't be here anymore I actually had a therapist who once said to me Eve you've been coming here for two years and to be honest it never occurred to me that you had a body All this time I lived in the city because to be honest I was afraid of trees I never had babies because heads cannot give birth Babies actually don't come out of your mouth As I had no reference point for my body I began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular their vaginas because I thought vaginas were kind of important This led to me writing The Vagina Monologues which led to me obsessively and incessantly talking about vaginas everywhere I could I did this in front of many strangers One night on stage I actually entered my vagina It was an ecstatic experience It scared me it energized me and then I became a driven person a driven vagina I began to see my body like a thing a thing that could move fast like a thing that could accomplish other things many things all at once I began to see my body like an iPad or a car I would drive it and demand things from it It had no limits It was invincible It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself I didn't heed it; no I organized it and I directed it I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape I was greedy I took more than my body had to offer If I was tired I drank more espressos If I was afraid I went to more dangerous places Oh sure sure I had moments of appreciation of my body the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness My father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday for example I heard people murmur from time to time that I should love my body so I learned how to do this I was a vegetarian I was sober I didn't smoke But all that was just a more sophisticated way to manipulate my body -- a further disassociation like planting a vegetable field on a freeway As a result of me talking so much about my vagina many women started to tell me about theirs -- their stories about their bodies Actually these stories compelled me around the world and I've been to over 60 countries I heard thousands of stories and I have to tell you there was always this moment where the women shared with me that particular moment when she separated from her body -- when she left home I heard about women being molested in their beds flogged in their burqas left for dead in parking lots acid burned in their kitchens Some women became quiet and disappeared Other women became mad driven machines like me In the middle of my traveling I turned 40 and I began to hate my body which was actually progress because at least my body existed enough to hate it Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated It was proof that I had not measured up that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape My stomach was proof that I had failed that it had failed me that it was broken My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it In fact it became so extreme I wrote a play about it But the more I talked about it the more objectified and fragmented my body became It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity something I was selling Then I went somewhere else I went outside what I thought I knew I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo And I heard stories that shattered all the other stories I heard stories that got inside my body I heard about a little girl who couldn't stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her I heard an 80-year-old woman whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets and twisted up on her head as the soldiers raped her like that There are thousands of these stories and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes fistula -- that were the violation of war -- holes in the fabric of their souls These stories saturated my cells and nerves and to be honest I stopped sleeping for three years All the stories began to bleed together The raping of the Earth the pillaging of minerals the destruction of vaginas -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers My body had not only become a driven machine but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine Then I got cancer -- or I found out I had cancer It arrived like a speeding bird smashing into a windowpane Suddenly I had a body a body that was pricked and poked and punctured a body that was cut wide open a body that had organs removed and transported and rearranged and reconstructed a body that was scanned and had tubes shoved down it a body that was burning from chemicals Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body was the crisis in the world and it wasn't happening later it was happening now Suddenly my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere the cancer of cruelty the cancer of greed the cancer that gets inside people who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor -- the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs the cancer of stress for not achieving enough the cancer of buried trauma the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness In his new and visionary book New Self New World the writer Philip Shepherd says If you are divided from your body you are also divided from the body of the world which then appears to be other than you or separate from you rather than the living continuum to which you belong Before cancer the world was something other It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool and cancer dynamited the boulder that was separating me from the larger sea Now I am swimming in it Now I lay down in the grass and I rub my body in it and I love the mud on my legs and feet Now I make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine and I hunger for the green fields in the bush outside Bukavu And when it rains hard rain I scream and I run in circles I know that everything is connected and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince And the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world I know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation the 16 ounces of puss is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication made me scream out the way the Earth cries out from the drilling In my second chemo my mother got very sick and I went to see her And in the name of connectedness the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico So we brought her home and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died And gratefully it didn't And she died quietly in her favorite place And a few weeks later I was in New Orleans and this beautiful spiritual friend told me she wanted to do a healing for me And I was honored And I went to her house and it was morning and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains And my friend was preparing this big bowl and I said What is it And she said It's for you The flowers make it beautiful and the honey makes it sweet And I said But what's the water part And in the name of connectedness she said Oh it's the Gulf of Mexico And I said Of course it is And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang And the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head I realized that it held the best and the worst of us It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion It was all the lies that got told before and after It was the honey in the water that made it sweet it was the oil that made it sick It was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf that were falling down my cheek It was finally being in my body It was the sorrow that's taken so long It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo and the indifference of the world It was the Congolese women who are now rising up It was my mother leaving just at the moment that I was being born It was the realization that I had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the Earth our mother is barely holding on in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by in the same way that there is a recipe for survival What I learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves It was advocating friends and a doting sister It was wise doctors and advanced medicine and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands It was underpaid and really loving nurses It was magic healers and aromatic oils It was people who came with spells and rituals It was having a vision of the future and something to fight for because I know this struggle isn't my own It was a million prayers It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms It was a lot of anger insane humor a lot of attention outrage It was energy love and joy It was all these things It was all these things It was all these things in the water in the world in my body I'm five years old and I am very proud My father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in Ukraine Inside it's a smelly gaping hole in the ground but outside it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun This makes me feel so proud so important that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise missions for us So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free Four years earlier when I was one after the Chernobyl accident the rain came down black and my sister's hair fell out in clumps and I spent nine months in the hospital There were no visitors allowed so my mother bribed a hospital worker She acquired a nurse's uniform and she snuck in every night to sit by my side Five years later an unexpected silver lining Thanks to Chernobyl we get asylum in the U。S I am six years old and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America because I expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and Bazooka bubble gum Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside Bazooka that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire week So the first day we get to New York my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the homeless shelter that my family's staying in Only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter We think that it's a hotel a hotel with lots of rats So we find this penny kind of fossilized in the floor and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there because regular people don't just lose money And I hold this penny in the palm of my hand and it's sticky and rusty but it feels like I'm holding a fortune I decide that I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum And in that moment I feel like a millionaire About a year later I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole life And again I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't order So we take the pizza our very first pizza and we devour slice after slice as the deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway And he tells us to pay but we don't speak English My mother comes out and he asks her for money but she doesn't have enough She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus fare Then our neighbor pops her head in and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza Everyone's upset But the pizza is delicious It doesn't hit me until years later just how little we had On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U。S。 we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U。S The man at the front desk laughs and he says You can't reserve a room here This is a homeless shelter And we were shocked My husband Brian was also homeless as a kid His family lost everything and at age 11 he had to live in motels with his dad motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill And one time when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back it was crawling with roaches But he did have one thing He had this shoebox that he carried with him everywhere containing nine comic books two G。I Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and five Gobots And this was his treasure This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams I'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family This is Scarlett Once upon a time Scarlet was used as bait in dog fights She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight And now these days she eats organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it but when we pour water for her in her bowl she still looks up and she wags her tail in gratitude Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett and she rolls through the grass and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude We forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments and we feel like millionaires Thank you What's happening in genomics and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves and how we think about them If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom and you saw the monolith you know that was Arthur C Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species In this case it was picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool And that moved us to the next level And you know we in the last 30 years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools And we've seen many seminal moments We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20 in your home and in not just your P。C but in every device -- in your washing machine your cell phone You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors Then we go along and create the Internet and connect the world together; we flatten the world We've seen so much change and we've given ourselves these tools now -- these high-powered tools -- that are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us and that is a genome How's your genome today Have you thought about it lately Heard about it at least You probably hear about genomes these days I thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is It's sort of like if you ask people Well what is a megabyte or megabit And what is broadband People never want to say I really don't understand So I will tell you right off of the bat You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology A genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast; it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse; doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA The DNA is organized in words call them: genes and chromosomes And when Watson and Crick in the '50s first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule -- very long complicated molecule -- we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics our traits what we inherit what diseases we may get We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever since the beginning of us of us as creatures There is a historical archive Living in your genome is the history of our species and you as an individual human being where you're from going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that's now starting to be understood But also the genome is really the instruction manual It is the program It is the code of life It is what makes you function; it is what makes every organism function DNA is a very elegant molecule It's long and it's complicated Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters: A T C G; they represent the name of a chemical And with these four letters you can create a language: a language that can describe anything and very complicated things You know they are generally put together in pairs creating a word or what we call base pairs And you would you know when you think about it four letters or the representation of four things makes us work And that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that's computers Look at this screen here and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros The language of technology is binary; you've probably heard that at some point in time Everything that happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero So when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly When you're seeing these pictures it's all ones and zeros and when you're talking on your telephone your cell phone and it's going over the network your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around And look at all the complex things and wonderful things we've been able to create with just a one and a zero Well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity a lot of ways to describe mechanisms So let's talk about what that means So if you look at a human genome they consist of 3。2 billion of these base pairs That's a lot And they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being If you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office It's not really all that much data I will also tell you we're at least as buggy This here is a bug in my genome that I have struggled with for a long long time When you get sick it is a bug in your genome In fact many many diseases we have struggled with for a long time like cancer we haven't been able to cure because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level We are starting to understand that So up to this point we tried to fix it by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology which means well let's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it's going to make it work But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer What is the code What are the exact instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out So for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here's a few factoids for you We actually have about 24，000 genes that do things We have about a hundred 120，000 others that don't appear to function every day but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years You might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount of genes They recently sequenced Pinot Noir and it also has about 30，000 genes so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity or the evolutionary order of any particular species Now look around: just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward We all look pretty different A lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures We are all 99。9% genetically equal It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material that makes the difference between any one of us That's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species So we are now able to read genomes The first human genome took 10 years three billion dollars It was done by Dr Craig Venter And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA -- genome was done for two million dollars and in just two months And if you think about the computer industry and how we've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now: we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about 5，000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour; you will see that happen in the next five years And what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card It will be here And when you buy medicine you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody You will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won't have side effects All those side effects you know oily residue and you know whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that They're going to make all that stuff go away What does a genome look like Well there it is It is a long long series of these base pairs If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this but what scientists are doing now is they're understanding what these do and what they mean Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time In other words the first couple of sentences here assuming this is a grape plant: make a root make a branch create a blossom In a human being down in here it could be: make blood cells start cancer For me it may be: every calorie you consume you conserve because I come from a very cold climate For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight It's all hidden in this code and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace So what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we're starting to have the book of life Well there's many things Some are exciting Some people will find very scary I will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that's okay So you know we now can learn the history of organisms You can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off You can find out where your relatives come from; you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years We can understand functionality This is really important We can understand for example why we create plaque in our arteries what creates the starchiness inside of a grain why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide We can also look at at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them Because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms Most importantly what we're learning is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox The toolbox exists An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now have the ability to use it We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them This company Synthetic Genomics I'm involved with created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium If you have a UTI you've probably -- or ever had a UTI -- you've come in contact with this little bug Very simple -- only has about 246 genes -- but we were able to completely synthesize that genome Now you have the genome and you say to yourself So if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live Well guess what It does Not only does it do that; if you took the genome -- that synthetic genome -- and you plugged it into a different critter like yeast you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma It's sort of like booting up a PC with a Mac O。S software Well actually you could do it the other way So you know by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism the software if you will changes the hardware And this is extremely profound So last year the French and Italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism and they identified once again about 29，000 genes They have discovered pathways that create flavors although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome in our tongue for us to understand and interpret those flavors They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease They now are understanding and the work is going on exactly how this plant works and we have the capability to know to read that entire code and understand how it ticks So then what do you do Knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch So what do you do Well one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir We can build a better vine By the way just so you know: you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms; there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock; they would not exist in nature on their own So don't worry about don't stress about that stuff We've been doing this forever So we could you know focus on disease resistance; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or costs We could conceivably expand the climate window: we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island God forbid We could produce better flavors and aromas You want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there All of these things could conceivably be done and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done But there's an ecosystem here In other words we're not sort of unique little organisms running around; we are part of a big ecosystem In fact -- I'm sorry to inform you -- that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes which you're circulating through your body quite a bit Our ocean's teaming with microbes; in fact when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere We find microbial life in every part of the planet: in ice in coal in rocks in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing But we've also discovered when it comes to plants in plants as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes it is the ecosystem around them it is the microbes that live in their root systems that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves If you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many diverse microbial colonies This is not big news to viticulturists; they have been you know concerned with water and fertilization And again this is sort of my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology: you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in You don't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics We can start to figure that out We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir; we say Wow is my terroir great It's so special I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe Well you know we really we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate it's soil it's this Well guess what We can figure out what the heck terroir is It's in there waiting to be sequenced There are thousands of microbes there They're easy to sequence: unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes; we can figure out what they are All we have to do is go around and sample dig into the ground find those bugs sequence them correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like -- that's just a big database -- and then fertilize And then we understand what is terroir So some people will say Oh my God are we playing God Are we now if we engineer organisms are we playing God And you know people would always ask James Watson -- he's not always the most politically correct guy 。。 。。 and they would say Are you know are you playing God And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question: Well somebody has to I consider myself a very spiritual person and without you know the organized religion part and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural I told you I'm going to make some of you puke It's very simple: we don't invent molecules compounds They're here They're in the universe We reorganize things we change them around but we don't make anything unnatural Now we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth -- but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made So what's happening today is Nature is presenting us with a toolbox and we find that this toolbox is very extensive There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline believe it or not There are microbes you know -- go back to yeast These are chemical factories; the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature and we now can use those There also is a set of rules Nature will not allow you to -- we could engineer a grape plant but guess what We can't make the grape plant produce babies Nature has put a set of rules out there We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules; we're just learning what the rules are I just ask the question if you could cure all disease -- if you could make disease go away because we understand how it actually works if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in very hard-to-grow environments if we could create clean and plentiful energy -- we right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline So carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar not anything Carbon dioxide a little bit of sunlight you end up with a lipid that is highly refined We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2，; we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine If we could would we Well you know I think the answer is very simple: working with Nature working with this tool set that we now understand is the next step in humankind's evolution And all I can tell you is stay healthy for 20 years If you can stay healthy for 20 years you'll see 150 maybe 300 Thank you Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully but what you're actually looking through is a two-way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully This is a dolphin that is self-aware This dolphin has self-awareness It's a young dolphin named Bayley I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past 30 years How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us And what I've used is a very simple research tool a mirror and we've gained great information reflections of these animal minds Dolphins aren't the only animals the only non-human animals to show mirror self-recognition We used to think this was a uniquely human ability but we learned that the great apes our closest relatives also show this ability Then we showed it in dolphins and then later in elephants We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants and it's been recently shown in the magpie Now it's interesting because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution this physical continuity But we've been much more reticent much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition in emotion in consciousness in other animals Other animals are conscious They're emotional They're aware There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals other animals that are quite different than we are in form We are not alone We are not alone in these abilities And I hope and one of my biggest dreams is that with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody and I hope I can really engage you in this idea Now I want to return to dolphins because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over 30 years And these are real personalities They are not persons but they're personalities in every sense of the word And you can't get more alien than the dolphin They are very different from us in body form They're radically different They come from a radically different environment In fact we're separated by 95 million years of divergent evolution Look at this body And in every sense of making a pun here these are true non-terrestrials I wondered how we might interface with these animals In the 1980s I developed an underwater keyboard This was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control These are big brains highly social animals and I thought well if we give them choice and control if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard -- and by the way it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer This seems prehistoric now but this was where we were with technology So the dolphins could hit a key a symbol they heard a computer-generated whistle and they got an object or activity Now here's a little video This is Delphi and Pan and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key he hears a computer-generated whistle -- -- and gets a ball so they can actually ask for things they want What was remarkable is they explored this keyboard on their own There was no intervention on our part They explored the keyboard They played around with it They figured out how it worked And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard They imitated on their own Beyond that though they started learning associations between the symbols the sounds and the objects What we saw was self-organized learning and now I'm imagining what can we do with new technologies How can we create interfaces new windows into the minds of animals with the technologies that exist today So I was thinking about this and then one day I got a call from Peter Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living On a good day it's music and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music-making experience I ever had I'm a farm boy I grew up surrounded by animals and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there So as an adult when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Kanzi Panbanisha Irene Pepperberg Alex the parrot I got all excited What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs I work with a lot of musicians from around the world and often we don't have any common language at all but we sit down behind our instruments and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote So I started cold-calling and eventually got through to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and she invited me down I went down and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments musical toys but never before to a keyboard At first they did what infants do just bashed it with their fists and then I asked through Sue if Panbanisha could try with one finger only Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Can you play a grooming song I want to hear a grooming song Play a real quiet grooming song PG: So groom was the subject of the piece So I'm just behind jamming yeah this is what we started with Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more She discovers a note she likes finds the octave She'd never sat at a keyboard before Nice triplets SSR: You did good That was very good PG: She hit good So that night we began to dream and we thought perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces visual-audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh got excited about that called her friend Steve Woodruff and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring which led us to Diana and led us to Neil Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks Peter PG: Thank you NG: So Peter approached me I lost it when I saw that clip He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people for animals And then I was struck in the history of the Internet This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle-aged white men mostly middle-aged white men Vint Cerf: NG: Speaking as one Then when I first came to TED which was where I met Peter I showed this This is a $1 web server and at the time that was radical And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care energy efficiency And we were happy with ourselves And then when Peter showed me that I realized we had missed something which is the rest of the planet So we started up this interspecies Internet project Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED and we realized that wouldn't work So we're going to bring you to them So if we could switch to the audio from this computer we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them And so if we could also have this up great So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco with orangutans In the daytime they live outside It's nighttime there now So can you please go ahead Terri Cox: Hi I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco Texas and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei two of our Bornean orangutans During the day they have a beautiful large outdoor habitat and at night they come into this habitat into their night quarters where they can have a climate-controlled and secure environment to sleep in We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals And they share 97 percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet and K。J has been enjoying the conference very much NG: That's great When we were rehearsing last night he had fun watching the elephants Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium Please go ahead Allison Ginsburg: Good evening Well my name is Allison Ginsburg and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins: 20-year-old Chesapeake who was our first dolphin born here her four-year-old daughter Bayley and her half sister 11-year-old Maya Now here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care to research and to conservation The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight They're not really used to having cameras here at 8 o'clock at night In addition we are very committed to doing different types of research As Diana mentioned our animals are involved in many different research studies NG: Those are for you Okay that's great thank you And the third user group in Thailand is Think Elephants Go ahead Josh Josh Plotnik: Hi my name is Josh Plotnik and I'm with Think Elephants International and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants And we have 26 elephants here and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant put food into the elephant's mouth show people what's going on inside their mouths and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are NG: Okay that's great Thanks Josh And once again we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing So at that point if we can go back to the other computer we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet and we went to the best possible person I can think of which is Vint Cerf who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet Vint VC: Thank you Neil A long time ago in a galaxy oops wrong script Forty years ago Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet Thirty years ago we turned it on Just last year we turned on the production Internet You've been using the experimental version for the last 30 years The production version it uses IP version 6 It has 3。4 times 10 to the 38th possible terminations That's a number only that Congress can appreciate But it leads to what is coming next When Bob and I did this design we thought we were building a system to connect computers together What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species that these other intelligent sentient species should be part of the system too This is the system as it looks today by the way This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet and how all the various networks are connected together There are about 400，000 networks interconnected run independently by 400，000 different operating agencies and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP/IP protocols Well you know where this is headed The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too: appliances that you use around the house that you use in your office that you carry around with yourself or in the car That's the Internet of Things that's coming Now what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person Well you can see what's coming next All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold What happens after that Well let's see There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to and so as time goes on we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to not with keyboards not with mice but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to So we'll need something like C3PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with Now there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet It's in operation between Earth and Mars It's operating on the International Space Station It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets So the interplanetary system is on its way but there's a last project which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency which funded the original ARPANET funded the Internet funded the interplanetary architecture is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in 100 years' time What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us ultimately how we might interact with an alien from another world I can hardly wait So first of all thank you and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each and we thank you for that I have so many questions but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know You're launching this idea here at TED PG: Today Today This is the first time you're talking about it Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea What's next PG: I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible NG: And just mechanically there's a 501 and web infrastructure and all of that but it's not quite ready to turn on so we'll roll that out and contact us if you want the information on it The idea is this will be -- much like the Internet functions as a network of networks which is Vint's core contribution this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives that are wonderful individually to link them globally Right and do you have a web address that we might look for yet NG: Shortly Shortly We will come back to you on that And very quickly just to clarify Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought well that's just a webcam What's special about it If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that NG: So this is scalable video infrastructure not for a few to a few but many to many so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet So there's a lot of back-end signal processing not for one to many but for many to many Right and then on a practical level which technologies are you looking at first I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this DR: We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work and we just got our first seed money today towards that so it's our first project Before the talk even DR: Yeah Wow Well done All right well thank you all so much for joining us It's such a delight to have you on the stage DR: Thank you VC: Thank you The old story about climate protection is that it's costly or it would have been done already So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly but profitable This was a simple sign error because it's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel as is well known to companies that do it all the time -- for example Dupont SD micro electronics Many other firms -- IBM -- are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants and they get their money back in two or three years That's called a profit Now similarly the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it it would be expensive or we would have done it already because markets are essentially perfect If of course that were true there would be no innovation and nobody could make any money But the new story about oil is the government doesn't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally but completely -- quite the contrary The United States for example can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time led by business for profit because it's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it This process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict particularly over oil This thesis is set out in a book called Winning the Oil Endgame that four colleagues and I wrote and have posted for free at Oilendgame。com -- about 170，000 downloads so far And it was co-sponsored by the Pentagon -- it's independent it's peer-reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal Now a bit of economic history I think may be helpful here Around 1850 one of the biggest U。S industries was whaling And whale oil lit practically every building But in the nine years before Drake struck oil in 1859 at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared thanks to fatal competitors chiefly oil and gas made from coal to which the whalers had not been paying attention So very unexpectedly they ran out of customers before they ran out of whales The remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit-maximizing capitalists And it's funny -- it feels a bit like this now for oil We've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil and no one had bothered to add them up before So when we did we found some very surprising things Now there are two big reasons to be concerned about oil Both national competitiveness and national security are at risk On the competitiveness front we all know that Toyota has more market cap than the big three put together And serious competition from Europe from Korea and next is China which will soon be a major net exporter of cars How long do you think it will take before you can drive home your new wally-badged Shanghai automotive super-efficient car Maybe a decade according to my friends in Detroit China has an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap-frog technology They're not going to export your uncle's Buick And after that comes India The point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient The question is who will make them Will we in the United States continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars That seems to make more sense The more we keep on using the oil particularly the imported oil the more we face a very obvious array of problems Our analysis assumes that they all cost nothing but nothing is not the right number It could well be enough to double the oil price for example And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens They don't like fighting over oil they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates Now in order to avoid these problems whatever you think they're worth it's actually not that complicated We can save half the oil by using it more efficiently at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel And then we can replace the other half with a combination of advanced bio-fuels and safe natural gas And that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel And compared with the official forecast that oil will cost 26 dollars a barrel in 2025 which is half of what we've been paying lately that will save 70 billion dollars a year starting quite soon Now in order to do this we need to invest about 180 billion dollars: half of it to retool the car truck and plane industries; half of it to build the advanced bio-fuel industry In the process we will gain about a million good jobs mainly rural And protect another million jobs now at risk mainly in auto-making And we'll also get returns over 150 billion dollars a year So that's a very handsome return It's financeable in the private capital market But if you want it for the reasons I just mentioned to happen sooner and with higher confidence then -- and also to expand choice and manage risk -- then you might like some light-handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic And these policies work fine without taxes subsidies or mandates They make a little net money for the treasury They have a broad trans-ideological appeal and because we want them actually to happen we figured out ways to do them that do not require much if any federal legislation and can indeed be done administratively or at a state level Just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicles here are four ultra-light carbon-composite concept cars with low drag and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive You can sort of have it all with these things For example this Opel two-seater does 155 miles an hour at 94 miles a gallon This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds and still gets 32 miles a gallon I'll say more later about this And in the upper left a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid in a four-seater Well saving that fuel 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon with better aerodynamics and tires and engines and so on and taking out weight so you can put it into payload So you can double efficiency with a 60 percent internal rate of return Then you can go even further almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements double the big haulers' margins And we intend to use those numbers to create demand pull and flip the market In the airplane business it's again a similar story where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free as Boeing is now demonstrating in its new Dreamliner But then the next generation of planes saves about half Again much cheaper than buying the fuel And if you go over the next 15 years or so to a blended-wing body kind of a flying wing with internal engines then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost Let me focus a minute on the light vehicles the cars and light trucks because we all know the most about those; probably everybody here drives one And yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan of all the fuel energy you feed into the car seven-eighths never gets to the wheels; it's lost first in the engine idling at zero miles a gallon the power train and accessories So then of the energy that does get to the wheels only an eighth of it half of that goes to heat the tires on the road or to heat the air the car pushes aside And only this little bit only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop In fact since 95 percent of the weight you're moving is the car not the driver less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver This is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort Moreover three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car And it's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels So there's huge leverage for making the car a lot lighter And the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry that -- well then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car and it would cost a lot more to make because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and magnesium But these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials For example we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety Here's a handmade McLaren SLR carbon car that got t-boned by a Golf The Golf was totaled The McLaren just popped off and scratched the side panel They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later But if this McLaren were to run into a wall at 65 miles an hour the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon-fiber composite cones weighing a total of 15 pounds hidden in the front end Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly And this means we've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight We could make cars bigger which is protective but make them light Whereas if we made them heavy they'd be both hostile and inefficient And when you make them light in the right way that can be simpler and cheaper to make You can end up saving money and lives and oil all at the same time I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic uncompromised quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle -- -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff strong carbon-composite material and then ways to thermoform it because it's a combination of carbon and nylon into whatever complex shapes you want like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers And the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified Because the auto body has only say 14 parts instead of 100 150 Each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel Each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist They snap together like a kid's toy So you got rid of the body shop And if you want you can lay color in the mold and get rid of the paint shop Those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car So you end up with at least two-fifths lower capital intensity than the leanest plant in the industry which GM has in Lansing The plant also gets smaller Now when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil including buildings industry feedstocks and so on you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 well about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel instead of 26 for buying the oil And then another six can be made robustly competitively from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio-diesel without interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production There is a huge amount of gas to be saved about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price And here are some no-brainer substitutions of it with lots left over So much in fact that after you've handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved you have only this little bit left and let's see how we can meet that because there's a pretty flexible menu of ways We could of course buy more efficiency Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12 Or wait to capture the second half of it Or we could of course just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers and they don't Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance or if we used it as hydrogen which is more profitable and efficient we'd get rid of the domestic oil too And that doesn't even count for example that available land in the Dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country So we have lots of options And the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible Now to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence there is a few ways government could help For example fee-bates a combination of a fee and a rebate in any size class of vehicle you want can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles You're not paid to change size class You are paid to pick efficiency within a size class in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three This expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient reliable warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get And for each car so financed scrap almost one clunker preferably the dirtiest ones This creates a new million-car-a-year market for Detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car And Detroit will make money on every unit It turns out that if say African-American and white households had the same car ownership it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities So this is a huge social win too Governments buy hundreds of thousands of cars a year There are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster And we could even do an X Prize-style golden carrot that's worth stretching further for For example a billion-dollar prize for the first U。S automaker to sell 200，000 really advanced vehicles like some you saw earlier Then the legacy airlines can't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that there are ways to finance it And at the same time to scrap inefficient old planes so that if they were otherwise to come back in the air they would waste more oil and block the uptake of efficient new planes Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive We ought to take them out back and shoot them and put bounty hunters after them Then there's an important military role That in creating the move to high-volume low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials or for that matter ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet Just turn it over to the private sector and we have an Internet The same for GPS The same for the modern semi-conductor industry That is military science and technology that they need can create the advanced materials-industrial cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil which would be a huge contribution to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security Then we need to retool the car industry and do retraining and shift the convergence of the energy and ag-value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates and get out of our own way in other ways And make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster But here's how the whole thing fits together Instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up they can turn down with the 12 dollars a barrel efficiency down steeply by adding the supply-side substitutions at 18 bucks all implemented at slower rates than we've done before when we paid attention And if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil in the 2040s And the one thing I'd like to point out here is that we've done this before In this eight-year period 1977 to 85 when we last paid attention the economy grew 27 percent oil use fell 17 percent oil imports fell 50 percent oil imports from the Persian Gulf fell 87 percent They would have been gone if we'd kept that up one more year Well that was with very old technologies and delivery methods We could rerun that play a lot better now And yet what we proved then is the U。S has more market power than OPEC Ours is on the demand side We are the Saudi Arabia of nega-barrels We can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil Whatever your reason for wanting to do this whether you're concerned about national security or price volatility -- -- or jobs or the planet or your grand-kids it seems to me that this is an oil endgame that we should all be playing to win Please download your copy and thank you very much So stepping down out of the bus I headed back to the corner to head west en route to a braille training session It was the winter of 2009 and I had been blind for about a year Things were going pretty well Safely reaching the other side I turned to the left pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal and waited my turn As it went off I took off and safely got to the other side Stepping onto the sidewalk I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me I know there's a cafe on the corner and they have chairs out in front so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street As I did so slid the chair I just figured I'd made a mistake and went back to the right and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity Now I was getting a little anxious I went back to the left and so slid the chair blocking my path of travel Now I was officially freaking out So I yelled Who the hell's out there What's going on Just then over my shout I heard something else a familiar rattle It sounded familiar and I quickly considered another possibility and I reached out with my left hand as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy and I came across an ear the ear of a dog perhaps a golden retriever Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me perhaps get a scratch behind the ear Who knows maybe she was volunteering for service But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you So let me step back and set the stage a little bit On St Patrick's Day of 2008 I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor The surgery was successful Two days later my sight started to fail On the third day it was gone Immediately I was struck by an incredible sense of fear of confusion of vulnerability like anybody would But as I had time to stop and think I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for In particular I thought about my dad who had passed away from complications from brain surgery He was 36 I was seven at the time So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead and had no clue quite what was going to happen I was alive My son still had his dad And besides it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful active life without sight So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later I left with a mission a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life Within six months I had returned to work My training had started I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies and was commuting to work on my own walking through town and taking the bus It was a lot of hard work But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time From that came a lot of insights or outsights as I called them things that I learned since losing my sight These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound from the mundane to the humorous As an architect that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself Paramount amongst those was the realization that actually cities are fantastic places for the blind And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself That was a little curious to me Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses things that you would otherwise maybe ignore It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are how you need to move and where you need to go Similarly just through the grip of the cane you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed Similarly just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space But also the sense of smell Some districts and cities have their own smell as do places and things around you and if you're lucky you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for All this really surprised me because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me When you're sighted everybody kind of sticks to themselves you mind your own business Lose your sight though and it's a whole other story And I don't know who's watching who but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me And I'm not paranoid but everywhere I go I'm getting all sorts of advice: Go here move there watch out for this A lot of the information is good Some of it's helpful A lot of it's kind of reversed You've got to figure out what they actually meant Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful But it's all good in the grand scheme of things But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway and came to a corner I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal and as it went off I was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my right hand was just gripped by this guy and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in Mandarin It's like there was no escape from this man's death grip but he got me safely there What could I do But believe me there are more polite ways to offer assistance We don't know you're there so it's kind of nice to say Hello first Would you like some help But while in Oakland I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight I liked it sighted It was fine It's a perfectly great city But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway I was blessed every block of the way Bless you man Go for it brother God bless you I didn't get that sighted And even without sight I don't get that in San Francisco And I know it bothers some of my blind friends it's not just me Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity out of our togetherness and I think it's pretty cool In fact if I'm feeling down I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland I go for a walk and I feel better like that in no time at all But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic social racial economic lines Disability is an equal-opportunity provider Everybody's welcome In fact I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people: There are those with disabilities and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet It's a different way of thinking about it but I think it's kind of beautiful because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind but the city needs us And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast It's too late then So if you design a city with the blind in mind you'll have a rich walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level If you design a city with the blind in mind sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars In fact cars who needs them If you're blind you don't drive They don't like it when you drive If you design a city with the blind in mind you design a city with a robust accessible well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around If you design a city with the blind in mind there'll be jobs lots of jobs Blind people want to work too They want to earn a living So in designing a city for the blind I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive a more equitable a more just city for all And based on my prior sighted experience it sounds like a pretty cool city whether you're blind whether you have a disability or you haven't quite found yours yet So thank you I am going to talk about myself which I rarely do because I -- well for one thing I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about And secondly I'm a recovering narcissist I didn't know I was a narcissist actually I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself And then someone told me there is a flip side to it So it's actually drearier than self-love; it's unrequited self-love I don't feel I can afford a relapse But I want to though explain how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy because I've been through so many different forms of it I started with improvisation in a particular form of improvisation called theater games which had one rule which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society And the rule was you couldn't deny the other person's reality you could only build on it And of course we live in a society that's all about contradicting other peoples' reality It's all about contradiction which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general I see it everywhere Like polls You know it's always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question is always two percent 75 percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy -- seems a contradiction Or this ad that I read in the New York Times: Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society Buying it from us screams good taste Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts Don't use big words Learn the lingua franca Yeah Lingua this Frankie And I suppose it's a contradiction that I talk about science when I don't know math You know because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance the reason I don't do math is I was taught to do math and read at the same time So you're six years old you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world: dwarves and Prince Charmings And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince That's why little girls don't do math It's too depressing Of course by talking about science I also may as I did the other night incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me I used the word postmodern as if it were OK And they got very upset One of them to his credit I think really just wanted to engage me in a serious argument But I don't engage in serious arguments I don't approve of them because arguments of course are all about contradiction and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with I have questions with the values of Newtonian science like rationality You're supposed to be rational in an argument Well rationality is constructed by what Christie Hefner was talking about today that mind-body split you know The head is good body bad Head is ego body id When we say I -- as when Rene Descartes said I think therefore I am -- we mean the head And as David Lee Roth sang in Just a Gigolo I ain't got no body That's how you get rationality And that's why so much of humor is the body asserting itself against the head That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers whacking Richard in the genital area And we're laughing doubly then because he's the body but it's also -- Voice offstage: Richard Emily Levine: Richard What did I say Richard Yes but it's also the head the head of the conference That's the other way that humor -- like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure -- but nevertheless what makes us treasure you and adore you There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though which is as much as we revere the head we are very anti-intellectual I know this because I read in the New York Times the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad after September 11 in which they said The problem is not Iraq or Iran the problem in this country facing this country is the university professors and their spawn So I went back and re-read The Fountainhead I don't know how many of you have read it And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217 The act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her was the kind of rapture she wanted When they lay together in bed it was as it had to be as the nature of the act demanded an act of violence It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred It was the unendurable Not a caress but a wave of pain The agony as an act of passion So you can imagine my surprise on reading in The New Yorker that Alan Greenspan Chairman of the Federal Reserve claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix Bad enough we had to see J Edgar Hoover in a dress Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan in a black leather corset with a butt tattoo that says Whip inflation now And Ayn Rand of course Ayn Rand is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism which reflects another value of Newtonian physics which is objectivity Objectivity basically is constructed in that same S&amp;M way It's the subject subjugating the object That's how you assert yourself You make yourself the active voice And the object is the passive no-voice I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial I don't know if you know this but -- maybe it's different now or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country until very recently anyway according to a book by Jessica Benjamin the signs over the little boys cribs read I'm a boy and the signs over the little girls cribs read It's a girl Yeah So the passivity was culturally projected onto the little girls And this still goes on as I think I told you last year There's a poll that proves -- there was a poll that was given by Time magazine in which only men were asked Have you ever had sex with a woman you actively disliked And well yeah Well 58 percent said yes which I think is overinflated though because so many men if you just say Have you ever had sex 。。 Yes They don't even wait for the rest of it And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had -- That's the first callback of my attempted quadruple So this subject-object thing is part of something I'm very interested in because this is why frankly I believe in political correctness I do I think it can go too far I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine We have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our Asian Elephant partners Maybe too far But you know -- I don't think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women Or poor people making fun of rich people the same as rich people I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots which is why you don't see me making fun of Kenneth Lay and his charming wife What's funny about being down to four houses And I really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or Or as I call them the good ol' days When people I knew you know people who considered themselves liberal and everything else were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones Basically they were making fun of them for being trailer trash or white trash It seems I suppose a harmless prejudice and that you're not really hurting anybody Until you read as I did an ad in the Los Angeles Times For sale: White trash compactor So this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin who is the chair of the Classics department at USC And the book is called The Garden of Priapus And she says that Roman humor mirrors the construction of Roman society So that Roman society was very top/bottom as ours is to some degree And so was humor There always had to be the butt of a joke So it was always the satirist like Juvenal or Martial represented the audience and he was going to make fun of the outsider the person who didn't share that subject status And in stand-up of course the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience A lot of heckling is the tension of trying to make sure that the comedian is going to be able to dominate and overcome the heckler And I got good at that when I was in stand up But I always hated it because they were dictating the terms of the interaction in the same way that engaging in a serious argument determines the content to some degree of what you're talking about And I was looking for a form that didn't have that And so I wanted something that was more interactive I know that word is so debased now by the use of it by Internet marketers I really miss the old telemarketers now I'll tell you that I do because at least there you stood a chance You know I used to actually hang up on them But then I read in Dear Abby that that was rude So the next time that one called I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said You sound sexy He hung up on me But the interactivity allows the audience to shape what you're going to do as much as you shape their experience of the world And that's really what I'm looking for And I was sort of as I was starting to analyze what exactly it is that I do I read a book called Trickster Makes This World by Lewis Hyde And it was like being psychoanalyzed I mean he had laid it all out And then coming to this conference I realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change Trickster is a change agent And the qualities that I'm about to describe are the qualities that make it possible to make change happen And one of these is boundary crossing I think this is what so in fact infuriated the scientists But I like to cross boundaries I like to as I said talk about things I know nothing about I hope that's my agent because you aren't paying me anything And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it you know I'm able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see Like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself He was a very selfish meme And he said that I had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly And I said Well that's how you know only stupid people go into it It only takes two years to learn how to talk And you know people this is the problem with quote objectivity unquote When you're only surrounded by people who speak the same vocabulary as you or share the same set of assumptions as you you start to think that that's reality Like economists you know their definition of rational that we all act out of our own economic self-interest Well look at Michael Hawley or look at Dean Kamen or look at my grandmother My grandmother always acted in other people's interests whether they wanted her to or not If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom my grandmother would have lost on purpose No you take the prize You're young I'm old Who's going to see it Where am I going I'm going to die soon So that's one -- this boundary crossing this go-between which -- Fritz Lanting is that his name actually said that he was a go-between That's an actual quality of the trickster And another is non-oppositional strategies And this is instead of contradiction Where you deny the other person's reality you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist I think there's another philosophical construction I'm not sure what it's called But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store It said Ears pierced while you wait There the alternative just boggles the imagination Oh no Thanks though I'll leave them here Thanks very much I have some errands to run So I'll be back to pick them up around five if that's OK with you Huh Huh What Can't hear you And another attribute of the trickster is smart luck That accidents that Louis Kahn who talked about accidents this is another quality of the trickster The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared That and I will say this to the scientists that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas I had no joke for that I just wanted to put the scientists in their place But here's how I think I like to make change and that is in making connections This is what I tend to see almost more than contradictions Like the what do you call those toes of the gecko You know the toes of the gecko curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen I love connections Like I'll read that one of the two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe -- one is space occupancy Matter takes up space I guess the more you matter the more space you take up which explains the whole SUV phenomenon And the other one though is impenetrability Well in ancient Rome impenetrability was the criterion of masculinity Masculinity depended on you being the active penetrator And then in economics there's an active producer and a passive consumer which explains why business always has to penetrate new markets Well yeah I mean why we forced China to open her markets And didn't that feel good And now we're being penetrated You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes You know we're being penetrated And I suspect by someone who actively dislikes us That's the second of the quadruple Yes of course you got that Thank you very much I still have a way to go And what I hope to do when I make these connections is short circuit people's thinking You know make you not follow your usual train of association but make you rewire It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition it's literally re-cognition rewiring how you think -- I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it I'm so sorry I'm getting like the woman in that joke about -- have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother And the mother is elderly And the mother goes right through a red light And the daughter doesn't want to say anything She doesn't want to be like You're too old to drive And the mother goes through a second red light And the daughter says as tactfully as possible Mom are you aware that you just went through two red lights And the mother says Oh Am I driving And that's the shock of recognition at the shock of recognition That completes the quadruple I just want to say two more things One is another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line He has to have poise And you know the biggest hurdle for me in doing what I do is constructing my performance so that it's prepared and unprepared Finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared But being too prepared doesn't leave room for the accidents to happen I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie said yesterday about beauty because in his book Hyde says that sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty But to do that you have to lose all the other qualities because once you're into beauty you're into a finished thing You're into something that occupies space and inhabits time It's an actual thing And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty But if you don't do that if you allow for the accident to keep on happening you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength I like to think of what I do as a probability wave When you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility And I like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is that he doesn't have a home He's always on the road I want to say to you Richard in closing that in TED you've created a home And thank you for inviting me into it Thank you very much I'm a little nervous because my wife Yvonne said to me she said Geoff you watch the TED Talks I said Yes honey I love TED Talks She said You know they're like really smart talented -- I said I know I know She said They don't want like the angry black man So I said No I'm gonna be good Honey I'm gonna be good I am But I am angry And the last time I looked I'm -- So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry This year there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose that we could -- right now we could save them all You saw the quality of the educators who were here Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them I know they could It is absolutely possible Why haven't we fixed this Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right -- enough to say Enough is enough So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense You know I grew up in the inner city and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school and those schools are still lousy today 56 years later And you know something about a lousy school It's not like a bottle of wine Right Where you say like '87 was like a good year right That's now how this thing -- I mean every single year it's still the same approach right One size fits all if you get it fine and if you don't tough luck Just tough luck Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen Do not tell me we can't do better than this Look you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years and you say So what's the plan And they say We'll we're going to do what we did last year this year What kind of business model is that Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3 They operated 10 to 3 They were closed for lunch hour Now who can bank between 10 and 3 The unemployed They don't need banks They got no money in the banks Who created that business model Right And it went on for decades You know why Because they didn't care It wasn't about the customers It was about bankers They created something that worked for them How could you go to the bank when you were at work It didn't matter And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank Go find another bank They all operate the same way Right Now one day some crazy banker had an idea Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work They might like that What about a Saturday What about introducing technology Now look I'm a technology fan but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old So I was a little slow and I did not trust technology and when they first came out with those new contraptions these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money I was like There's no way that machine is going to count that money right I am never using that right So technology has changed Things have changed Yet not in education Why Why is it that when we had rotary phones when we were having folks being crippled by polio that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now And if you come up with a plan to change things people consider you radical They will say the worst things about you I said one day well look if the science says -- this is science not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- You see where they are in June and say okay they're there You look at them in September they've gone down You say whoo So I heard about that in '75 when I was at the Ed School at Harvard I said Oh wow this is an important study Because it suggests we should do something Every 10 years they reproduce the same study It says exactly the same thing: Poor kids lose ground in the summertime The system decides you can't run schools in the summer You know I always wonder who makes up those rules For years I went to -- Look I went the Harvard Ed School I thought I knew something They said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense I never got that I never got that because anyone knows if you farm you don't plant crops in July and August You plant them in the spring So who came up with this idea Who owns it Why did we ever do it Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have schools were open all year They were open all year because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day They didn't have any place for their kids to go It was a perfect place to have schools So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods So why don't we Why don't we Because our business has refused to use science Science You have Bill Gates coming out and saying Look this works right We can do this How many places in America are going to change None None Okay yeah there are two All right Yes there'll be some place because some folks will do the right thing As a profession we have to stop this The science is clear Here's what we know We know that the problem begins immediately Right This idea zero to three My wife Yvonne and I we have four kids three grown ones and a 15-year-old That's a longer story With our first kids we did not know the science about brain development We didn't know how critical those first three years were We didn't know what was happening in those young brains We didn't know the role that language a stimulus and response call and response how important that was in developing those children We know that now What are we doing about it Nothing Wealthy people know Educated people know And their kids have an advantage Poor people don't know and we're not doing anything to help them at all But we know this is critical Now you take pre-kindergarten We know it's important for kids Poor kids need that experience Nope Lots of places it doesn't exist We know health services matter You know we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about you know because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff but we do health services and I have to raise a lot of money People used to say when they'd come fund us Geoff why do you provide these health services I used to make stuff up Right I'd say Well you know a child who has cavities is not going to uh be able to study as well And I had to because I had to raise the money But now I'm older and you know what I tell them You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts Because I actually like kids I actually like kids But when they really get pushy people really get pushy I say I do it because you do it for your kid And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better but you will give that kid dance instruction and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction and it will make your day And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity It's the floor for these children So here's the other thing I'm a tester guy I believe you need data you need information because you work at something you think it's working and you find out it's not working I mean you're educators You work you say you think you've got it great no And you find out they didn't get it But here's the problem with testing The testing that we do -- we're going to have our test in New York next week is in April You know when we're going to get the results back Maybe July maybe June And the results have great data They'll tell you Raheem really struggled couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data but you're getting it back after school is over And so what do you do You go on vacation You come back from vacation Now you've got all of this test data from last year You don't look at it Why would you look at it You're going to go and teach this year So how much money did we just spend on all of that Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use I need that data in September I need that data in November I need to know you're struggling and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that I need to know that this week I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late Because in my older years I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant I can predict school scores You take me to any school I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level And I say Okay what's the plan what did we do from last year to this year You say We're doing the same thing I'm going to make a prediction This year somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level And I will be right every single time So we're spending all of this money but we're getting what Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids The high stakes is today because you can do something about it So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about We can't stifle innovation in our business We have to innovate And people in our business get mad about innovation They get angry if you do something different If you try something new people are always like Ooh charter schools Hey let's try some stuff Let's see This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years Let's try something different And here's the rub Some of it's not going to work You know people tell me Yeah those charter schools a lot of them don't work A lot of them don't They should be closed I mean I really believe they should be closed But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything Right Because that's not the way the world works If you think about technology imagine if that's how we thought about technology Every time something didn't work we just threw in the towel and said Let's forget it Right You know they convinced me I'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing the PalmPilot They told me Geoff if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing That thing lasted all of three weeks It was over I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing Did anybody stop inventing Not a person Not a soul The folks went out there They kept inventing The fact that you have failure that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward Our job as educators there's some stuff we know that we can do And we've got to do better The evaluation we have to start with kids earlier we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people We've got to give them all of these opportunities So that we have to do But this innovation issue this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical And this is something by the way that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right We have run out of time I don't know about a fiscal cliff but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars What is five billion dollars to the United States What did we spend in Afghanistan this year How many trillions When the country cares about something we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye When the safety of America is threatened we will spend any amount of money The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about I dare say it's a pittance what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems So once we do that I'll no longer be angry So you guys help me get there Thank you all very much Thank you John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone Geoffrey Canada: Well you know John 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school A hundred percent of them went to college This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college We'd better get that other seven percent So that's just how this goes JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school GC: Well you know one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids the same kids these same vulnerable kids when you get them in school they drop out in record numbers And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does They harass you right They call you they say I want to see your grades How'd you do on that last test What are you talking about that you want to leave school And you're not coming back here So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you They're like I really can't come back No You'd better stay in school But I'm not kidding about some of this and it gets a little bit to the grit issue When kids know that you refuse to let them fail it puts a different pressure on them and they don't give up as easy So sometimes they don't have it inside and they're like You know I don't want to do this but I know my mother's going to be mad Well that matters to kids and it helps get them through We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support but also a set of encouragements that say to them You can do it It is going to be hard but we refuse to let you fail JL: Well thank you Dr Canada Please give it up for him one more time Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle that you can carry with you anywhere that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes and you can run it for 1，000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity But when I say the word electric vehicle people think about vehicles They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day But if you come about it from a different perspective you can create some more interesting more novel concepts So we built something I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here So this is the motor This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour about 30 kilometers an hour and this battery this battery right here has about six miles of range or 10 kilometers which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the U。S alone But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store These are from remote control airplanes And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco 6 Mile Range Top Speed Near 20mph Uphill Climbing Regenerative Braking So we're going to show you what this thing can do It's really maneuverable You have a hand-held remote so you can pretty easily control acceleration braking go in reverse if you like also have braking It's incredible just how light this thing is I mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles This uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation So next time you think about a vehicle I hope like us you're thinking about something new Thank you Ah yes those university days a heady mix of Ph。D-level pure mathematics and world debating championships or as I like to say Hello ladies Oh yeah Didn't get much sexier than the Spence at university let me tell you It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from Sydney Australia to be here on the TED stage literally on the other side of the world And I wanted to let you know a lot of the things you've heard about Australians are true From the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent On the field of battle we are brave and noble warriors What you've heard is true Australians we don't mind a bit of a drink sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations This is my father's work Christmas party December 1973 I'm almost five years old Fair to say I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was is and always will be a mathematician And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep I cast my mind back when I was in second grade at a beautiful little government-run school called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney and as we came up towards lunchtime our teacher Ms Russell said to the class Hey year two What do you want to do after lunch I've got no plans It was an exercise in democratic schooling and I am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven So some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical and after a while someone made a particularly silly suggestion and Ms Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism That wouldn't work That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole Now I wasn't trying to be smart I wasn't trying to be funny I just politely raised my hand and when Ms Russell acknowledged me I said in front of my year two classmates and I quote But Miss surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop wouldn't it And there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates until sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class Steven leaned across and punched me really hard in the head Now what Steven was saying was Look Adam you are at a critical juncture in your life here my friend You can keep sitting here with us Any more of that sort of talk you've got to go and sit over there with them I thought about it for a nanosecond I took one look at the road map of life and I ran off down the street marked Geek as fast as my chubby asthmatic little legs would carry me I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages I explained it to all my friends Maths is beautiful It's natural It's everywhere Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written The great Descartes said something quite similar The universe is written in the mathematical language And today I want to show you one of those musical notes a number so beautiful so massive I think it will blow your mind Today we're going to talk about prime numbers Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime because it's 2 x 3 Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7 but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks or as we call them factors Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers One is not prime The proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties Another thing about primes there is no final biggest prime number They keep going on forever We know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid Over thousands of years ago he proved that for us But the third thing about prime numbers mathematicians have always wondered well at any given moment in time what is the biggest prime that we know about Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime Don't freak out All you need to know of all the mathematics you've ever learned unlearned crammed forgotten never understood in the first place all you need to know is this: When I say 2 ^ 5 I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 4 8 16 32 If you've got that you're with me for the entire journey Okay So 2 ^ 5 those five little twos multiplied together 1 31 31 is a prime number and that five in the power is also a prime number And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found are of that form: two to a prime number take away one I won't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do but suffice to say a number of that form is fairly easy to test for primacy A random odd number is a lot harder to test But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power 1 2，047 and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89 But 1 1 1 are all prime numbers After that point they thin out a lot And one of the things about the search for massive primes that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler In the 1700s other mathematicians said he is simply the master of us all He was so respected they put him on European currency back when that was a compliment Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime: 1 It's over two billion He proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill ink paper and his mind You think that's big We know that 1 is a prime number It's an absolute brute Look at it here: 39 digits long proven to be prime in 1876 by a mathematician called Lucas Word up L-Dog But one of the great things about the search for massive primes it's not just finding the primes Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting Lucas again in 1876 showed us 1 21 digits long was not prime But he didn't know what the factors were We knew it was like six but we didn't know what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together to give us that massive number We didn't know for almost 40 years until Frank Nelson Cole came along And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians he walked to the board took up a piece of chalk and started writing out the powers of two: two four eight 16 -- come on join in with me you know how it goes -- 32 64 128 256 512 1，024 2，048 I'm in geek heaven We'll stop it there for a second Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there He went on and on and calculated 67 powers of two He took away one and wrote that number on the board A frisson of excitement went around the room It got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format -- and for the rest of the hour of his talk Frank Nelson Cole busted that out He had found the prime factors of 1 The room went berserk -- -- as Frank Nelson Cole sat down having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do It took focus It took dedication It took him by his estimate three years of Sundays But then in the field of mathematics as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED the age of the computer goes along and things explode These are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996 a very emotional year for me It was the year I left university I was torn between mathematics and media It was a tough decision I loved university My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life But I came to a realization about my own ability Put simply in a room full of randomly selected people I'm a maths genius In a roomful of maths Ph。Ds I'm as dumb as a box of hammers My skill is not in the mathematics It is in telling the story of the mathematics And during that time since I've left university these numbers have got bigger and bigger each one dwarfing the last until along came this man Dr Curtis Cooper who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime only to see it snatched away by a rival university And then Curtis Cooper got it back Not years ago not months ago days ago In an amazing moment of serendipity I had to send TED a new slide to show you what this guy had done I still remember -- -- I still remember when it happened I was doing my breakfast radio show I looked down on Twitter There was a tweet: Adam have you seen the new largest prime number I shivered -- -- contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room and said Girls hold the front page We're not talking politics today We're not talking sport today They found another megaprime The girls just shook their heads put them in their hands and let me go my own way It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know currently the largest prime number we know is 2 ^ 57，885，161 Don't forget to subtract the one This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that's 22 meg For the slightly less geeky of you think about the Harry Potter novels okay This is the first Harry Potter novel This is all seven Harry Potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end Written out as a book this number would run the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again Here's a slide of the first 1，000 digits of this prime If when TED had begun at 11 o'clock on Tuesday we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second it would have taken five hours to show you that number I was keen to do it could not convince Bono That's the way it goes This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime That fills me with almost sexual excitement And who am I kidding when I say almost I know what you're thinking: Adam we're happy that you're happy but why should we care Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful First of all as I explained to ask a computer Is that number prime to type it in its abbreviated form and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy is a remarkably simple question to ask It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer and just requires phenomenal grunt Large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips But secondly as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn't the only guy searching My laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers The discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops desktops in the palms of people's hands who are simply helping out for the search But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor for the time in which we live when human minds and machines can conquer together We've heard a lot about robots in this TED We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do It is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess You think that's cool Here's a machine doing something cool This is the CubeStormer II It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube Using the power of the smartphone it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds That scares some people That excites me How lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower-case c celebrity in Australia What was your highlight of 2012 People were expecting me to talk about my beloved Sydney Swans football team In our beautiful indigenous sport of Australian football they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl I was there It was the most emotional exciting day It wasn't my highlight of 2012 People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show It might have been a politician It might have been a breakthrough It might have been a book I read the arts No no no It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done No it wasn't The highlight of 2012 so clearly was the discovery of the Higgs boson Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions: How is it that the things that make us up have no mass I've clearly got mass Where does it come from And he postulated a suggestion that there's this infinite incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe and as other particles go through those particles and interact that's where they get their mass The rest of the scientific community said Great idea Higgsy We've got no idea if we could ever prove it It's beyond our reach And within just 50 years in his lifetime with him sitting in the audience we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number We thought it might be there and we went and found it That is the essence of being human That is what we are all about Or as my friend Descartes might put it we think therefore we are Thank you America's public energy conversation boils down to this question: Would you rather die of A) oil wars or B) climate change or C) nuclear holocaust or D) all of the above Oh I missed one: or E) none of the above That's the one we're not normally offered What if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing Could we have fuel without fear Could we reinvent fire You see fire made us human; fossil fuels made us modern But now we need a new fire that makes us safe secure healthy and durable Let's see how Four-fifths of the world's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo Those fossil fuels have built our civilization They've created our wealth They've enriched the lives of billions But they also have rising costs to our security economy health and environment that are starting to erode if not outweigh their benefits So we need a new fire And switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air But they're really quite distinct Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil -- although almost half is made from coal Their uses are quite concentrated Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings And the rest of both runs factories So very efficient vehicles buildings and factories save oil and coal and also natural gas that can displace both of them But today's energy system is not just inefficient it is also disconnected aging dirty and insecure So it needs refurbishment By 2050 though it could become efficient connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos factories and buildings all relying on a modern secure and resilient electricity system We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply This could cost by 2050 five trillion dollars less in net present value that is expressed as a lump sum today than business as usual -- assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero -- a conservatively low estimate Yet this cheaper energy system could support 158 percent bigger U。S economy all without needing oil or coal or for that matter nuclear energy Moreover this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of Congress and no new federal taxes mandate subsidies or laws and running Washington gridlock Let me say that again I'm going to tell you how to get the United States completely off oil and coal five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of Congress led by business for profit In other words we're going to use our most effective institutions -- private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health reinventing fire makes sense and makes money General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies So in reinventing fire we integrated all four sectors that use energy -- transportation buildings industry and electricity -- and we integrated four kinds of innovation not just technology and policy but also design and business strategy Those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles So let's start by making autos oil free Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car is caused by its weight And every unit of energy you save at the wheels by taking out weight or drag saves seven units in the tank because you don't have to waste six units getting the energy to the wheels Unfortunately over the past quarter century epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have But today ultralight ultrastrong materials like carbon fiber composites can make dramatic weight savings snowball and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build Lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them so their engines get smaller Indeed that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today while the driving cost even from the start is very much lower So these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other -- namely ultralight materials making them into structures and electric propulsion The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones And just in the first two years the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency The resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers Of course computers and electronics are now America's biggest industry while typewriter makers have vanished So vehicle fitness opens a new automotive competitive strategy that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years but then also make electrification affordable and that displaces the rest of the oil America could lead this next automotive revolution Currently the leader is Germany Last year Volkswagen announced that by next year they'll be producing this carbon fiber plugin hybrid getting 230 miles a gallon Also last year BMW announced this carbon fiber electric car they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries And they said We do not intend to be a typewriter maker Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year Seven years ago an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is Don't worry about dropping it it's tougher than titanium Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it But such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos They can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel If we made all of our autos this way it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half Saudi Arabias or half an OPEC by drilling in the Detroit formation a very prospective play And all those mega-barrels under Detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel They are all-American carbon-free and inexhaustible The same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles In the five years ending with 2010 Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile in its giant fleet of heavy trucks through better logistics and design But just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes now on the drawing board can save close to a trillion dollars Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military R&amp;D has given us the Internet the Global Positioning System and the jet engine and microchip industries As we design and build vehicles better we can also use them smarter by harnessing four powerful techniques for eliminating needless driving Instead of just seeing the travel grow we can use innovative pricing charging for road infrastructure by the mile not by the gallon We can use some smart IT to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing We can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be so they don't need to go somewhere else And we can use smart IT to make traffic free-flowing Together those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving saving another 0。4 trillion dollars plus 0。3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively So 40 years hence when you add it all up a far more mobile U。S economy can use no oil Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks rather than buying them for over a hundred adds up to a $4 trillion net saving counting all the hidden costs at zero So to get mobility without oil to phase out the oil we can get efficient and then switch fuels Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells electricity and advanced biofuels The trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels The trucks could even use natural gas But no vehicles will need oil And the most biofuel we might need just three million barrels a day can be made two-thirds from waste without displacing any cropland and without harming soil or climate Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings by what we call institutional acupuncture We figure out where the business logic is congested and not flowing properly we stick little needles in it to get it flowing working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon And the long transition is already well under way In fact three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil not in supply but in demand And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016 In other words oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices But the electrified vehicles don't need to burden the electricity grid Rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage that help the grid integrate varying solar and wind power So the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately And they also converge the oil story with our second big story saving electricity and then making it differently And those twin revolutions in electricity will bring to that sector more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions than any other sector because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on with 20th and 19th century institutions rules and cultures Changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it Most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we're installing them So the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper But as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy America's electricity use could actually shrink even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends Over the next 40 years buildings which use three-quarters of the electricity can triple or quadruple their energy productivity saving 1。4 trillion dollars net present value with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in English the savings are worth four times what they cost And industry can accelerate too doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return The key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings That is it can give you expanding returns not diminishing returns That is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light but reflect heat plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the maximum cooling load by a third And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years Integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment has already returned nine billion dollars But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save For example three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors Half of that runs pumps and fans And those can all be made more efficient and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements paying back in about a year But first we ought to be capturing bigger cheaper savings that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks For example pumps the biggest use of motors move liquid through pipes But a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy not by getting better pumps but just by replacing long thin crooked pipes with fat short straight pipes This is not about new technology it's just rearranging our metal furniture Of course it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs So what do such savings mean for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors Well from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost pollution and what Hunter Lovins calls global weirding back at the power plant And of course as you go back upstream the components get smaller and therefore cheaper Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns -- everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries Typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost Now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity chiefly renewables China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost In fact these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart And Germany now has more solar workers than America has steel workers Already in about 20 states private installers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your utility bill Such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams Renewables are no longer a fringe activity For each of the past four years half of the world's new generating capacity has been renewable mainly lately in developing countries In 2010 renewables other than big hydro particularly wind and solar cells got 151 billion dollars of private investment and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year In contrast the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk In fact in this country no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants Well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and combined with renewables can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost But we only need to replace them once We're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on because they're 24/7 whereas wind and solar power are variable and hence supposedly unreliable Actually no generator is 24/7 They all break And when a big plant goes down you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds often for weeks or months often without warning That is exactly why we've designed the grid to back up failed plants with working plants And in exactly the same way the grid can handle wind and solar power's forecastable variations Hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they're forecasted integrated and diversified by both type and location And that's true both for continental areas like the U。S or Europe and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid That is how for example four German states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered Denmark 36 And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity In America our aging dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal or renewables that are more or less centralized But those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks around national security fuel water finance technology climate and health For example our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack But that blackout risk disappears and all of the other risks are best managed with distributed renewables organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect but can stand alone at need That is they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting for its own power supply They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending We want our stuff to work too At about the same cost as business as usual this would maximize national security customer choice entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation Together efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply are starting to transform the whole electricity sector Traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables And those utilities were rewarded as they still are in 34 states for selling you more electricity However especially where regulators are now instead rewarding cutting your bills the investments are shifting radically toward efficiency demand response cogeneration renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably with less transmission and little or no bulk electricity storage So our energy future is not fate but choice and that choice is very flexible In 1976 for example government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP could never go down And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold Well that's what's actually happened so far It's fallen by half But with today's much better technologies more mature delivery channels and integrative design we can do far more and even cheaper So to solve the energy problem we just needed to enlarge it And the results may at first seem incredible but as Marshall McLuhan said Only puny secrets need protection Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions both driven by modern efficiency and you get the really big story: reinventing fire where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050 saving 5 trillion dollars growing the economy 2。6-fold strengthening out national security oh and by the way by getting rid of the oil and coal reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent Now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important So focusing on outcomes not motives can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge This also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges -- climate change nuclear proliferation energy insecurity energy poverty -- all of which make us less safe Now our team at RMI helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives with some more hatching Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too Former oil man Maurice Strong said Not all the fossils are in the fuel But as Edgar Woolard who used to chair Dupont reminds us Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem because he said they simply won't be around long-term I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species We humans are inventing a new fire not dug from below but flowing from above; not scarce but bountiful; not local but everywhere; not transient but permanent; not costly but free And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure this new fire is flameless Efficiently used it really can do our work without working our undoing Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize And our new book Reinventing Fire describes how you can capture it So with the conversation just begun at ReinventingFire。com let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other with everyone around you to help make the world richer fairer cooler and safer by together reinventing fire Thank you If you haven't ordered yet I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce goes best with diseases of the small intestine So sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting No what I want to do is take you back to 1854 in London for the next few minutes and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak which in many ways I think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today This period in 1854 in the middle part of the 19th century in London's history is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons But I think the most important one is that London was this city of 2。5 million people and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point But it was also the largest city that had ever been built And so the Victorians were trying to live through and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living: this scale of living that we you know now call metropolitan living And it was in many ways at this point in the mid-1850s a complete disaster They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an Elizabethan public infrastructure So people for instance just to gross you out for a second had cesspools of human waste in their basement Like a foot to two feet deep And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away And all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in It was an amazingly smelly city Not just because of the cesspools but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people Not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street So you would just walk around London at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years And cholera was really the great killer of this period It arrived in London in 1832 and every four or five years another epidemic would take 10，000 20，000 people in London and throughout the U。K And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem We had to get rid of the smell And so in fact they concocted a couple of early you know founding public-health interventions in the system of the city one of which was called the Nuisances Act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river Because if we get it out of the streets it'll smell much better and -- oh right we drink from the river So what ended up happening actually is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water It's a waterborne disease not something that's in the air It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing So this was the state of London in 1854 and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow who was a local doctor in Soho in London who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease and had basically convinced nobody of this The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me is that in some ways it's a great case study in how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored And then on one day August 28th of 1854 a young child a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know we know her only as Baby Lewis somehow contracted cholera came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street You can't really see it in this map but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book It's in the middle of Soho in this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the Nuisances Act bordered on an extremely popular water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to And so this little girl inadvertently ended up contaminating the water in this popular pump and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England erupted about two or three days later Literally 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days and much more would have died if people hadn't fled after the initial outbreak kicked in So it was this incredibly terrifying event You had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of 48 hours of cholera alone in their one-room apartments in their little flats Just an extraordinary terrifying scene Snow lived near there heard about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually potentially end up convincing people that in fact the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air He suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source One single thing that everybody was going to because it didn't have the traditional slower path of infections that you might expect And so he went right in there and started interviewing people He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy Henry Whitehead who was a local minister who was not at all a man of science but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood And he managed to track down Whitehead did many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump or who hadn't drunk water from the pump And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn't you know percentages of people who hadn't but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood And so he created this map which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address And you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead And the map is actually a little bit bigger As you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent And so you can see this something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance And so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that Whitehead did eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story but by 1866 when the next big cholera outbreak came to London the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem And they had already started building the sewers in London and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since So part of this story I think -- well it's a terrifying story it's a very dark story and it's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead if we listen to the locals who understand what's going on in these kinds of situations And what it ended up doing is making the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying in the space of seven days there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2。5 million people But because of what Snow did because of this map because of the whole series of reforms that happened in the wake of this map we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people cities like this one are in fact sustainable things We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself quite the way that you know Rome did and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life the life that we're enjoying here today Thank you very much I'd like to take you to another world And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor living on less than one dollar a day I went to a very elitist snobbish expensive education in India and that almost destroyed me I was all set to be a diplomat teacher doctor -- all laid out Then I don't look it but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years The whole world was laid out for me Everything was at my feet I could do nothing wrong And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like So in 1965 I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India and I saw starvation death people dying of hunger for the first time It changed my life I came back home told my mother I'd like to live and work in a village Mother went into a coma What is this The whole world is laid out for you the best jobs are laid out for you and you want to go and work in a village I mean is there something wrong with you I said No I've got the best eduction It made me think And I wanted to give something back in my own way What do you want to do in a village No job no money no security no prospect I said I want to live and dig wells for five years Dig wells for five years You went to the most expensive school and college in India and you want to dig wells for five years She didn't speak to me for a very long time because she thought I'd let my family down But then I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified respected applied on a large scale And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college I went to this village for the first time Elders came to me and said Are you running from the police I said No You failed in your exam I said No You didn't get a government job I said No What are you doing here Why are you here The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich; what are you doing in this village Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us I said No I want to actually start a college only for the poor What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice They said Please don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college So it's the only college in India where if you should have a Ph。D or a Master's you are disqualified to come You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college You have to work with your hands You have to have a dignity of labor You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community So we started the Barefoot College and we redefined professionalism Who is a professional A professional is someone who has a combination of competence confidence and belief A water diviner is a professional A traditional midwife is a professional A traditional bone setter is a professional These are professionals all over the world You find them in any inaccessible village around the world And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal It needs to be used needs to be applied needs to be shown to the world outside -- that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi You eat on the floor you sleep on the floor you work on the floor There are no contracts no written contracts You can stay with me for 20 years go tomorrow And no one can get more than $100 a month You come for the money you don't come to Barefoot College You come for the work and the challenge you'll come to the Barefoot College That is where we want you to try crazy ideas Whatever idea you have come and try it It doesn't matter if you fail Battered bruised you start again It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate You are certified by the community you serve You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer So when I said that they said Well show us what is possible What are you doing This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986 It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write built on $1。50 a sq ft 150 people lived there worked there They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002 But then they suspected they thought there was an architect behind it I said Yes they made the blueprints but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50，000 because they didn't believe us and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia I asked a forester -- high-powered paper-qualified expert -- I said What can you build in this place He had one look at the soil and said Forget it No way Not even worth it No water rocky soil I was in a bit of a spot And I said Okay I'll go to the old man in village and say 'What should I grow in this spot？' He looked quietly at me and said You build this you build this you put this and it'll work This is what it looks like today Went to the roof and all the women said Clear out The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men This is waterproofing the roof It is a bit of jaggery a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know But it actually doesn't leak Since 1986 it hasn't leaked This technology the women will not share with the men It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified All the power comes from the sun 45 kilowatts of panels on the roof And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years So long as the sun shines we'll have no problem with power But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest a Hindu priest who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school never been to college He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed Food if you come to the Barefoot College is solar cooked But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women illiterate women who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker Unfortunately they're almost half German they're so precise You'll never find Indian women so precise Absolutely to the last inch they can make that cooker And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother illiterate who's a dentist She actually looks after the teeth of 7，000 children Barefoot technology: this was 1986 -- no engineer no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs Very little water is wasted All the roofs are connected underground to a 400，000 liter tank and no water is wasted If we have four years of drought we still have water on the campus because we collect rainwater 60 percent of children don't go to school because they have to look after animals -- sheep goats -- domestic chores So we thought of starting a school at night for the children Because the night schools of Tilonia over 75，000 children have gone through these night schools Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher And what do we teach in these schools Democracy citizenship how you should measure your land what you should do if you're arrested what you should do if your animal is sick This is what we teach in the night schools But all the schools are solar-lit Every five years we have an election Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process and they elect a prime minister The prime minister is 12 years old She looks after 20 goats in the morning but she's prime minister in the evening She has a cabinet a minister of education a minister for energy a minister for health And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7，000 children She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago and she went to Sweden First time ever going out of her village Never seen Sweden Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening And the Queen of Sweden who's there turned to me and said Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from She's only 12 years old and she's not dazzled by anything And the girl who's on her left turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said Please tell her I'm the prime minister Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high we use puppetry Puppets is the way we communicate You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old He is my psychoanalyst He is my teacher He's my doctor He's my lawyer He's my donor He actually raises money solves my disputes He solves my problems in the village If there's tension in the village if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says Shake hands The attendance must not drop These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports So this decentralized demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan -- all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained And we went to Ladakh and we asked this woman -- this at minus 40 you have to come out of the roof because there's no place it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman What was the benefit you had from solar electricity And she thought for a minute and said It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter Went to Afghanistan One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable Men are restless men are ambitious men are compulsively mobile and they all want a certificate All across the globe you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate Why Because they want to leave the village and go to a city looking for a job So we came up with a great solution: train grandmothers What's the best way of communicating in the world today Television No Telegraph No Telephone No Tell a woman So we went to Afghanistan for the first time and we picked three women and said We want to take them to India They said Impossible They don't even go out of their rooms and you want to take them to India I said I'll make a concession I'll take the husbands along as well So I took the husbands along Of course the women were much more intelligent than the men In six months how do we train these women Sign language You don't choose the written word You don't choose the spoken word You use sign language And in six months they can become solar engineers They go back and solar-electrify their own village This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan was by the three women This woman is an extraordinary grandmother 55 years old and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan And they haven't collapsed She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC He didn't know Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan We went to Africa and we did the same thing All these women sitting at one table from eight nine countries all chatting to each other not understanding a word because they're all speaking a different language But their body language is great They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers I went to Sierra Leone and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village Comes back goes into the village says Well what's the story They said These two grandmothers 。。 Grandmothers The minister couldn't believe what was happening Where did they go Went to India and back Went straight to the president He said Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone He said No Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day What's the story So he summoned me and said Can you train me 150 grandmothers I said I can't Mr President But they will The grandmothers will So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone Gambia: we went to select a grandmother in Gambia Went to this village I knew which woman I would like to take The community got together and said Take these two women I said No I want to take this woman They said Why She doesn't know the language You don't know her I said I like the body language I like the way she speaks Difficult husband; not possible Called the husband the husband came swaggering politician mobile in his hand Not possible Why not The woman look how beautiful she is I said Yeah she is very beautiful What happens if she runs off with an Indian man That was his biggest fear I said She'll be happy She'll ring you up on the mobile She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran She handled the national press and she was a star And when I went back six months later I said Where's your husband Oh somewhere It doesn't matter Success story I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside Look for solutions within And listen to people They have the solutions in front of you They're all over the world Don't even worry Don't listen to the World Bank listen to the people on the ground They have all the solutions in the world I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi First they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and then you win Thank you I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype My wife sent me a message Whoa earthquake and then disappeared for 25 minutes It was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the U。S felt I was afraid of a tsunami; what I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti and that was building collapse We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake while I was making my way through the D。R into the country This is the national palace -- the equivalent of the White House This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time This is a nurses' college -- there are 300 nurses studying The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost We haven't heard about why the buildings failed After all it was the buildings not the earthquake that killed 220，000 people that injured 330，000 that displaced 1。3 million people that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007 providing engineering and business support to small businesses And after the quake we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed to examine what was safe and what wasn't Working with MINUSTAH which is the U。N mission in Haiti with the Ministry of Public Works with different NGOs we inspected over 1，500 buildings We inspected schools and private residencies We inspected medical centers and food warehouses We inspected government buildings This is the Ministry of Justice Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives The fellow in the door Andre Filitrault -- who's the director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo -- was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives Andre told me after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way that there is no new research here There is nothing here that we don't know The failure points were the same: walls and slabs not tied properly into columns -- that's a roof slab hanging off the building -- cantilevered structures or structures that were asymmetric that shook violently and came down poor building materials not enough concrete not enough compression in the blocks rebar that was smooth rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away Now there's a solution to all these problems And we know how to build properly The proof of this came in Chile almost a month later when 8。8 magnitude earthquake hit Chile That is 500 times the power of the 7。0 that hit Port-au-Prince -- 500 times the power yet only under a thousand casualties Adjusted for population density that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake What was the difference between Chile and Haiti Seismic standards and confined masonry where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing If you look at this building in Chile it's ripped in half but it's not a pile of rubble Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades Right now AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers Architecture for Humanity to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti This is Xantus Daniel; he's a mason just a general construction worker not a foreman who took one of our trainings On his last job he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong He took his boss aside and he showed him the materials on confined masonry He showed him You know we don't have to do this wrong It won't cost us any more to do it the right way And they redid that building They tied the rebar right they poured the columns right and that building will be safe And every building that they build going forward will be safe To make sure these buildings are safe it's not going to take policy -- it's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques Now there are many groups doing this And the fellow in the vest there Craig Toten he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this Through Haiti Rewired through Build Change Architecture for Humanity AIDG there is the possibility to reach out to 30，000 -- 40，000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way it's extremely affordable For the billions spent on reconstruction you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime Ultimately there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti; the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building where the walls are tied together the building is symmetric and it will stand up to an earthquake For all the disaster there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation so that when the next earthquake hits it is a disaster -- but not a tragedy This is poo and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you which might be quite difficult but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source which is dung So the question is where do we start this story And it seems appropriate to start at the end because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living and so dung beetles eat dung and their larvae are also dung-feeders They are grown completely in a ball of dung Within South Africa we've got about 800 species of dung beetles in Africa we've got 2，000 species of dung beetles and in the world we have about 6，000 species of dung beetles So according to dung beetles dung is pretty good Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself you'll never see 90 percent of the dung beetle species because they go directly into the dung straight down below it and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground So the question is how do they deal with this material And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort Ten percent of the species actually make a ball and this ball they roll away from the dung source usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball You can see it's a male because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there And then he's about to become a victim of a vicious smash-and-grab And this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung So this dung pat was actually -- well it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld Its head is down It's walking backwards It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat This is Africa It's hot So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems So watch this beetle and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way See look it does a little dance and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place A little dance and then heads off in a particular direction So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go and that's a very very important thing because if you think about it you're at the dung pile you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line So we gave them some more tasks to deal with and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet And watch its response So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet It's turned by 90 degrees But it doesn't flinch It knows exactly where it wants to go and it heads off in that particular direction So our next question then was how are they doing this What are they doing And there was a cue that was available to us It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball and they'd take a look at the world around them And what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement And the most obvious one is to look at the sky and so we thought now what could they be looking at in the sky And the obvious thing to look at is the sun So a classic experiment here in that what we did was we moved the sun What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position And look at what the beetle does It does a little double dance and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place What happens now So clearly they're looking at the sun The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them The thing is the sun is not always available to you because at sunset it disappears below the horizon What is happening in the sky here is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and I can't see It's the way our eyes are built But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon say it's over on this side there is a north-south a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see So how do we test that Well that's easy What we do is we get a great big polarization filter pop the beetle underneath it and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in So obviously beetles can see polarized light Okay so what we've got so far is what are beetles doing They're rolling balls How are they doing it Well they're rolling them in a straight line How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line Well they're looking at celestial cues in the sky some of which you and I can't see But how do they pick up those celestial cues That was what was of interest to us next And it was this particular little behavior the dance that we thought was important because look it takes a pause every now and then and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in So what are they doing when they do this dance How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves And in this experiment here what we did was we forced them into a channel and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in in the first place And let's see what his reaction is as he's headed through 90 degrees here and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction And see what his response is He does a little dance he turns around and heads back in this He knows exactly where he's going He knows exactly what the problem is and he knows exactly how to deal with it and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves So that's the dance but after spending many years sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior Every now and then when they climb on top of the ball they wipe their face And you see him do it again Now we thought now what could be going on here Clearly the ground is very hot and when the ground is hot they dance more often and when they do this particular dance they wipe the bottom of their face And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down So what we did was design a couple of arenas one was hot one was cold We shaded this one We left that one hot And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera So what you're looking at here is a heat image of the system and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball So the truth is if you look at the temperature over here dung is cool So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 35 degrees centigrade so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld It isn't climbing It isn't dancing because its body temperature is actually relatively low It's about the same as yours and mine And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment look at the temperature of the soil It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade Watch how often the beetle dances And look at its front legs They're roaringly hot So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face and all the time it's trying to cool itself down we think and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across And what we did then was put little boots on these legs because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil And if you look over here with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on So we described these as cool boots It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots And we also cooled down the dung ball so we were able to put the ball in the fridge gave them a nice cool dung ball and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball So this is called stilting It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach we jump onto a towel somebody has this towel -- Sorry I've jumped onto your towel -- and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel and that way you don't burn your feet And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here However there's one more story I'd like to share with you and that's this particular species It's from a genus called Pachysoma There are 13 species in the genus and they have a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting This is a dung beetle Watch what he's doing Can you spot the difference They don't normally go this slowly It's in slow motion but it's walking forwards and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating and that's that it forages and provisions a nest So watch this individual here and what he's trying to do is set up a nest And he doesn't like this first position but he comes up with a second position and about 50 minutes later that nest is finished and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets And what I want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path and compare the two And by and large you'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path On the outward path he's always on the lookout for a new blob of dung On the way home he knows where home is and he wants to go straight to it The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip as in most dung beetles The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site And watch you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food and then when it finds food it heads straight home It knows exactly where its home is Now there's two ways it could be doing that and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site If it's using landmarks it will find its home If it is using something called path integration it will not find its home It will arrive at the wrong spot and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction It knows the bearing home and it knows it should be in that direction If you displace it it ends up in the wrong place So let's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment So here's our cunning experimenter He displaces the beetle and now we have to see what is going to take place What we've got is a burrow That's where the forage was The forage has been displaced to a new position If he's using landmark orientation he should be able to find the burrow because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it If he's using path integration then it should end up in the wrong spot over here So let's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test So there he is there He's about to head home and look what happens Shame It hasn't a clue It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food but it is clearly completely lost So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance and we know that these species here actually count the steps That's what they use as an odometer a step-counting system to find their way back home We don't know yet what dung beetles use So what have we learned from these animals with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice Well we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it's also a thermoregulation behavior and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance we can actually learn an awful lot from these things doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do Thank you When I was a child I always wanted to be a superhero I wanted to save the world and then make everyone happy But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton which was a lot of fun but didn't get much result When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth I started my journey in California with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life By measuring their student smiles researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others In another yearbook I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture When I first saw his picture I thought that these superpowers came from his super collar But now I know it was all in his smile Another aha moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72。9 years where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years The good news is that we're actually born smiling Using 3D ultrasound technology we can now see that developing babies appear to smile even in the womb When they're born babies continue to smile -- initially mostly in their sleep And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice Smiling is one of the most basic biologically-uniform expressions of all humans In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea Paul Ekman the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions found that even members of the Fore tribe who were completely disconnected from Western culture and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing we smile often and you smile to express joy and satisfaction How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day Raise your hand if you do Oh wow Outside of this room more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five In fact those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children who smile as many as 400 times per day Have you ever wondered why being around children who smile so frequently makes you smile very often A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles You ask why Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether our smile is fake or real so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles Without the pencil subjects were excellent judges but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired In addition to theorizing on evolution in The Origin of Species Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better -- rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good In his study Darwin actually cited a French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne who used electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles Please don't try this at home In a related German study researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles The finding supported Darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2，000 bars of chocolate Wait The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16，000 pounds Sterling in cash That's like 25 grand a smile It's not bad And think about it this way: 25，000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day And unlike lots of chocolate lots of smiling can actually make you healthier Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol adrenaline and dopamine increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphin and reduce overall blood pressure And if that's not enough smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous but you actually appear to be more competent So whenever you want to look great and competent reduce your stress or improve your marriage or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate -- without incurring the caloric cost -- or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer healthier happier life smile There's something that I'd like you to see Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled millions in China: footage of a two-year-old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby footage too graphic to be shown The entire accident is caught on camera The driver pauses after hitting the child his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second Within two minutes three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely Others look at her before moving off Peter Singer: There were other people who walked past Wang Yue and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm She was rushed to hospital but it was too late She died I wonder how many of you looking at that said to yourselves just now I would not have done that I would have stopped to help Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you As I thought that's most of you And I believe you I'm sure you're right But before you give yourself too much credit look at this UNICEF reports that in 2011 6。9 million children under five died from preventable poverty-related diseases UNICEF thinks that that's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from 12 million in 1990 That is good But still 6。9 million is 19，000 children dying every day Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street Does it really matter that they're far away I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference The fact that they're not right in front of us the fact of course that they're of a different nationality or race none of that seems morally relevant to me What is really important is can we reduce that death toll Can we save some of those 19，000 children dying every day And the answer is yes we can Each of us spends money on things that we do not really need You can think what your own habit is whether it's a new car a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization the Against Malaria Foundation which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one and we know reliably that if we provide nets they're used and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those 19，000 children dying every day Fortunately more and more people are understanding this idea and the result is a growing movement: effective altruism It's important because it combines both the heart and the head The heart of course you felt You felt the empathy for that child But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed and not only that but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people wherever they are are like us that they can suffer as we can that parents grieve for the deaths of their children as we do and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us it matters just as much to all of these people So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want It does help us to put perspective on our situation And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math And that might seem surprising because a lot of people think Philosophy is remote from the real world; economics we're told just makes us more selfish and we know that math is for nerds But in fact it does make a difference and in fact there's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this This is the website of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side it says All lives have equal value That's the understanding the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett No one not Andrew Carnegie not John D Rockefeller has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective According to one estimate the Gates Foundation has already saved 5。8 million lives and many millions more people getting diseases that would have made them very sick even if eventually they survived Over the coming years undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more is going to save a lot more lives Well you might say that's fine if you're a billionaire you can have that kind of impact But if I'm not what can I do So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving They worry how much of a difference they can make But you don't have to be a billionaire This is Toby Ord He's a research fellow in philosophy at the University of Oxford He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career an academic career he could give enough to cure 80，000 people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living So Toby founded an organization called Giving What We Can to spread this information to unite people who want to share some of their income and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty Toby himself does better than that He's pledged to live on 18，000 pounds a year -- that's less than 30，000 dollars -- and to give the rest to those organizations And yes Toby is married and he does have a mortgage This is a couple at a later stage of life Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott who when they were young when they met were activists against the Vietnam War fought for social justice and then moved into careers as most people do didn't really do anything very active about those values although they didn't abandon them And then as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement they returned to them and they've decided to cut back on their spending to live modestly and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty Now mentioning time might lead you to think Well should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these 19，000 lives that are lost every day One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch He's a graduate student in philosophy and he's set up a website called 80，000 Hours the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career to advise people on how to have the best most effective career But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider if they have the right abilities and character is to go into banking or finance Why Because if you earn a lot of money you can give away a lot of money and if you're successful in that career you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ let's say five aid workers in developing countries and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career Here's one young man who's taken this advice His name is Matt Weiger He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated But he's gone into finance in New York He's already earning enough so that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote The Life You Can Save which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots and not cheat steal maim kill but that if we have enough we have to share some of that with people who have so little And the organization draws together people of different generations like Holly Morgan who's an undergraduate who's pledged to give 10 percent of the little amount that she has and on the right Ada Wan who has worked directly for the poor but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give Many people will think though that charities aren't really all that effective So let's talk about effectiveness Toby Ord is very concerned about this and he's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others so it's very important to find the effective ones Take for example providing a guide dog for a blind person That's a good thing to do right Well right it is a good thing to do but you have to think what else you could do with the resources It costs about 40，000 dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma So you do the sums and you get something like that You could provide one guide dog for one blind American or you could cure between 400 and 2，000 people of blindness I think it's clear what's the better thing to do But if you want to look for effective charities this is a good website to go to GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities not just whether they're well-run and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one So it's very tough If you want to look for other recommendations thelifeyoucansave。com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list but you can find effective organizations and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations That's another cause that I've been concerned about all my life the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year So if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering you can go to Effective Animal Activism And some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently when an asteroid passed close to our planet Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us but actually to deflect them So some people think that would be a good thing to give to There's many possibilities My final question is some people will think it's a burden to give I don't really believe it is I've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student It's been something fulfilling to me Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist He thinks that the life he's saving is his own And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism and now is one of the happiest people she knows I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill Just as he gets there the effort becomes too much the boulder escapes rolls all the way down the hill he has to trudge back down to push it up again and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle where you work hard to get money you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you'll enjoy using But then the money's gone you have to work hard to get more spend more and to maintain the same level of happiness it's kind of a hedonic treadmill You never get off and you never really feel satisfied Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living I'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago It's from a man named Chris Croy who I'd never heard of This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery Why was he recovering from surgery The email began Last Tuesday I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys There's about 100 people each year in the U。S and more in other countries who do that I was pleased to read it Chris went on to say that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did Well I have to admit I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that because I still have two kidneys But Chris went on to say that he didn't think that what he'd done was all that amazing because he calculated that the number of life-years that he had added to people the extension of life was about the same that you could achieve if you gave 5，000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation And that did make me feel a little bit better because I have given more than 5，000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective charities So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well there's a way for you to get off the hook Thank you In terms of invention I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on but I think it's also the simplest It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet the number one cause of death in children under five which is 。。 Water-borne diseases Diarrhea Malnutrition No it's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this Can you believe that I find this shocking and somewhat appalling Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels Can't we make better stoves How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes which is charcoal So this is a picture of rural Haiti Haiti is now 98 percent deforested You'll see scenes like this all over the island It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil So the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage They know perfectly well but they have no other choice Fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared And so this is what they do You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it So not surprisingly there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels About four years ago I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel But this device was very slow So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device So you could imagine they were very excited about it And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn So it was a little discouraging to the students And in fact if you look closely right here you can see it says U。S Peace Corps As it turns out there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village it was 800 kilometers away And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level You see these all over Haiti as well They're small-scale sugar mills And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse It has no other use It has no nutritional value so they don't feed it to the animals It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal So over the next couple of years students and I worked to develop a process So you start with the bagasse and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum After some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln and then you end up with this carbonized material here However you can't burn this It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes And conveniently one of my students was from Ghana and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root And so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti under the name of manioc And in fact it's grown all over the world -- yucca tapioca manioc cassava it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable And you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes So we did this We went down to Haiti These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Chabon or Charcoal Institute And these -- -- that's right So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT And these are the briquettes that we made Now I'm going to take you to a different continent This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India; it's cow dung And more than in Haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel Kids and women are especially affected by it because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there Well unfortunately they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava but that didn't stop us What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel And we did side-by-side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel And in fact it heats the water a lot more quickly And so we were very happy thus far But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal it didn't burn as long And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti So we went back to MIT we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there And after some time we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns longer cleaner than wood charcoal So now we're in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be In Haiti alone about 30 million trees are cut down every year There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those In addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars That's an awful lot for a country of Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project And one of the things that I think is also interesting is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal And he's found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel That's remarkable but up until now there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel One of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month And this is I think the coolest thing and it's even lower tech than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing Here it is So what is this This is corncobs turned into charcoal And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made This is my $100 laptop right here And actually like Nick I brought samples So we can pass these around They're fully functional field-tested ready to roll out And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is so easy Compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre-briquetted And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life But once you see it like you guys in the front row all right yeah OK So anyway -- -- here it is And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things So not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products They can generate income from this They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics or environment and economics So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us So when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in And now I don't actually mean the world that we live in I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work 10 hours a day you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water That's as if the entire workforce of the State of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water It's a place where for example if this were India in this room only three of us would have a car If this were Afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet If this were Zambia 300 of you would be farmers 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneurs to be facing These are the solutions that we need to find I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making poultry rearing etc But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops And we need to rethink our development strategies so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers And we need to think about how we can do that effectively We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems That's the best way to do it We shouldn't be doing it from outside So we need to create this future and we need to start doing it now Thank you Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on Amy Smith: A couple of other things that we're working on are looking at ways to do low-cost water quality testing so that communities can maintain their own water systems know when they're working know when they treat them etc We're also looking at low-cost water treatment systems One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that What's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale Do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale AS: Yeah I think its large numbers of people moving it forward It's a difficult thing; it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward And we're a pretty small staff which is me So you know I do what I can with the students We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame as -- you know you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead But I think with the vision to do that we can move forward Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother Mamar in our four-family home in Brooklyn New York Her apartment was an oasis It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee which was really warm milk with just a touch of caffeine She loved life And although she worked in a factory she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music And then when I was eight and she was 60 something changed She no longer worked or traveled She no longer danced There were no more coffee times My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis And my father who worked at night would spend every afternoon with her just to make sure she ate Her care became all-consuming for our family And by the time a diagnosis was made she was in a deep spiral Now many of you will recognize her symptoms My grandmother had depression A deep life-altering depression from which she never recovered And back then so little was known about depression But even today 50 years later there's still so much more to learn Today we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men And even with this high prevalence women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of fatigue sleep disturbance pain and anxiety compared with men And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression And it isn't only depression in which these sex differences occur but they occur across so many diseases So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest And today I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women Today we know that every cell has a sex Now that's a term coined by the Institute of Medicine And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels It means that we're different across all of our organs From our brains to our hearts our lungs our joints Now it was only 20 years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions But then in 1993 the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health And in many ways the law has worked Women are now routinely included in clinical studies and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease But remarkably what we have learned about these differences is often overlooked So we have to ask ourselves the question: Why leave women's health to chance And we're leaving it to chance in two ways The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences And the second is that we aren't taking what we have learned and routinely applying it in clinical care We are just not doing enough So I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women and where we need to do more Let's start with heart disease It's the number one killer of women in the United States today This is the face of heart disease Linda is a middle-aged woman who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart When she had recurring symptoms she went back to her doctor Her doctor did the gold standard test: a cardiac catheterization It showed no blockages Linda's symptoms continued She had to stop working And that's when she found us When Linda came to us we did another cardiac catheterization and this time we found clues But we needed another test to make the diagnosis So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound where you use soundwaves to look at the artery from the inside out And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease The typical male disease looks like this There's a discrete blockage or stenosis Linda's disease like the disease of so many women looks like this The plaque is laid down more evenly more diffusely along the artery and it's harder to see So for Linda and for so many women the gold standard test wasn't gold Now Linda received the right treatment She went back to her life and fortunately today she is doing well But Linda was lucky She found us we found her disease But for too many women that's not the case We have the tools We have the technology to make the diagnosis But it's all too often that these sex diffferences are overlooked So what about treatment A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question: What are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women The authors looked at papers written over a 10-year period and hundreds had to be thrown out And what they found out was that of those that were tossed out 65 percent were excluded because even though women were included in the studies the analysis didn't differentiate between women and men What a lost opportunity The money had been spent and we didn't learn how women fared And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very very important question what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women I want to introduce you to Hortense my godmother Hung Wei a relative of a colleague and somebody you may recognize -- Dana Christopher Reeve's wife All three women have something very important in common All three were diagnosed with lung cancer the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today All three were nonsmokers Sadly Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease Today what we know is that women who are nonsmokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are nonsmokers Now interestingly when women are diagnosed with lung cancer their survival tends to be better than that of men Now here are some clues Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen And when these genes are over-expressed it's associated with improved survival only in young women Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men Now let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences it can drive the science Several years ago a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated and when the authors looked at whose tumors shrank they found that 82 percent were women This led them to ask the question: Well why And what they found was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women And what this has led to is a more personalized approach to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance We know that when you invest in research you get results Take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time Now let's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer -- these are the dollars invested per death -- and the dollars invested in lung cancer Now it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results They may not be fast enough but it has produced results We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease So let's go back to depression Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today Our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner -- that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated -- so you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress You can actually see the difference And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression But even though we know that these differences occur 66 percent of the brain research that begins in animals is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified So I think we have to ask again the question: Why leave women's health to chance And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to dramatically improve the health of women We know that every cell has a sex We know that these differences are often overlooked And therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today We have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum Women's health is an equal rights issue as important as equal pay And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research Or if we analyzed our data by sex So people often ask me: What can I do And here's what I suggest: First I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other causes that are important to you And second and equally as important that as a woman you have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring for those who you love: Is this disease or treatment different in women Now this is a profound question because the answer is likely yes but your doctor may not know the answer at least not yet But if you ask the question your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer And this is so important not only for ourselves but for all of those whom we love Whether it be a mother a daughter a sister a friend or a grandmother It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women That's her legacy Our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come Thank you The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental It's particularly a cultural crisis a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing unable to challenge the oil-hungry selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption from southern California to New York to Dubai So I just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings and in fact depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future will not come from enclaves of economic power and abundance but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today And let me illustrate what I mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict as harboring creativity as I briefly introduce you to the Tijuana-San Diego border region which has been the laboratory to rethink my practice as an architect This is the wall the border wall that separates San Diego and Tijuana Latin America and the United States a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities jurisdictions and resources across the world In this border region we find some of the wealthiest real estate as I once found in the edges of San Diego barely 20 minutes away from some of the poorest settlements in Latin America And while these two cities have the same population San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana in the last decades immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density which are at the center of today's discussion about environmental sustainability So I've been arguing in the last years that in fact the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of San Diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization What do I mean by the informal in this case I'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana that build themselves in fact with the waste of San Diego or the many migrant neighborhoods in Southern California that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades So I've been interested as an artist in the measuring the observation of many of the trans-border informal flows across this border: in one direction from south to north the flow of immigrants into the United States and from north to south the flow of waste from southern California into Tijuana I'm referring to the recycling of these old post-war bungalows that Mexican contractors bring to the border as American developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades So these are houses waiting to cross the border Not only people cross the border here but entire chunks of one city move to the next and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames they leave the first floor to become the second to be in-filled with more house with a small business This layering of spaces and economies is very interesting to notice But not only houses also small debris from one city from San Diego to Tijuana Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls But look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency They have figured out how to peel off the tire how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall Or the garage doors that are brought from San Diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of Tijuana So while as an architect this is a very compelling thing to witness this creative intelligence I also want to keep myself in check I don't want to romanticize poverty I just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness that informality here the informal is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs See here buildings are not important just for their looks but in fact they are important for what they can do They truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources So while waste flows southbound people go north in search of dollars and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration in the alteration of the homogeneity of many neighborhoods in the United States particularly in San Diego And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of Southern California depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization -- I mean on steroids -- with the small programs social and economic I'm referring to how immigrants when they come to these neighborhoods they begin to alter the one-dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family This socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new inclusive and more equitable land use policies So many stories emerge from these dynamics of alteration of space such as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha，&amp;quot; which tells the story of a small house that saved itself it did not travel to Mexico but it was retrofitted in the end into a Buddhist temple and in so doing this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small or a micro socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood So these action neighborhoods as I call them really become the inspiration to imagine other interpretations of citizenship that have less to do in fact with belonging to the nation-state and more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city As an artist I've been interested in fact in the visualization of citizenship the gathering of many anecdotes urban stories in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces This is a story of a group of teenagers that one night a few months ago decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park With shovels in hand they started to dig Two weeks later the police stopped them They barricaded the place and the teenagers were evicted and the teenagers decided to fight back not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process The first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political jurisdiction inscribed in that empty space They found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under Caltrans territoy Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them They were lucky they said because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway that belongs to the local municipality They were also lucky they said because they began to dig in a sort of Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction between port authority airport authority two city districts and a review board All these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space With this knowledge these teenagers as skaters confronted the city They came to the city attorney's office The city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an NGO and of course they didn't know what an NGO was They had to talk to their friends in Seattle who had gone through the same experience And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise to organize budgets to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city expanding it to other categories At the end the teenagers won the case with that evidence and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway Now for many of you this story might seem trivial or naive For me as an architect it has become a fundamental narrative because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability They also taught me that similar to the migrant communities on both sides of the border they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city In that act that informal bottom-up act of transgression really began to trickle up to transform top-down policy Now this journey from the bottom-up to the transformation of the top-down is where I find hope today And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations with space and with policy in many cities in the world in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance social organization and infrastructure really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban It is in fact this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city I want to say this and emphasize it because this is the only way I see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption to neighborhoods of production today Thank you Good afternoon I am not a farmer I'm not I'm a parent I'm a resident and I'm a teacher And this is my world And along the way I've started noticing -- I'm on my third generation of kids -- that they're getting bigger They're getting sicker In addition to these complexities I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition The realities of my community are simple They look like this Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this And as jobs continue to leave my community and energy continues to come in be exported in it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today And with that note I come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live learn and earn in a better one So I'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside which I'm now bringing inside And it starts with three people The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left I dress up pretty thank you my wife I love you for getting a good suit -- my passionate borough president and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology But it all starts with seeds in classrooms in my place which looks like this And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp And that's really what this is all about And it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners most come with a lot of handicaps most are homeless and many are in foster care Almost all of my kids live below poverty But with those seeds from day one we are growing in my classroom and this is what it looks like in my classroom And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this But again I am not a farmer I'm a teacher And I don't like weeding and I don't like back-breaking labor So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success into something small like this and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it kids who didn't want to be outside could do it and everyone could have access So I called George Irwin and what do you know He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences private-based learning And lo and behold we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City So if you're hungry get up and eat You can do it right now My kids play cow all the time Okay But we were just getting started the kids loved the technology so we called up George and we said We gotta learn more Now Mayor Bloomberg thank you very much we no longer need work permits which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you -- We decided to go to Boston And my kids from the poorest congressional district in America became the first to install a green wall designed by a computer with real-live learning tools 21 stories up -- if you're going to go visit it it's on top of the John Hancock building But closer to home we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that real LED stuff 21st-century technology And what do you know We made 21st century money and that was groundbreaking Wow This is my harvest people And what do you do with this food You cook it And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce with plastic forks and we get it into the cafeteria and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President And what'd we do then Well I met nice people like you and they invited us to the Hamptons So I call this from South Bronx to Southampton And we started putting in roofs that look like this and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this wow People noticed And so we got invited back this past summer and we actually moved into the Hamptons payed 3，500 dollars a week for a house and we learned how to surf And when you can do stuff like this -- These are my kids putting in this technology and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that with sedum that looks like this this is the new green graffiti So you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids besides changing landscapes and mindsets Okay I'm going to tell you what it does It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line Because Jim realized that these kids my future farmers really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers right in their own neighborhood And this is what my kids are doing making living wage Now if you're like me you live in a building there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars I don't have it But if you need a toilet fixed or you know some shelving I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me That's the beauty of this economy But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade And that's my first student to open up the first in his family to have a bank account This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM And this is the true triple bottom line because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this with interiors like this Wow People noticed And notice they did So CNN called and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market And then when Rockefeller Center said NBC could you put this thing up on the walls We were delighted But this I show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall design it plant it and install it in the heart of New York City that's a true sí se puede moment Really scholastic if you ask me But this is not a Getty image That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President addressing my kids in his house not the jailhouse making them feel a part of it That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important And when the Bronx Borough President shows up and the State Senator comes to our class believe you me the Bronx can change attitudes now We are poised ready willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined And when the local senator gets on the scale in public and says he's got to lose weight so do I And I tell you what I'm doing it and so are the kids Okay And then celebrities started Produce Pete can't believe what we grow Lorna Sass came and donated books Okay We're feeding seniors And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx so did the international community And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in the first international green roof conference And that's just great Except what about locally Well we met this woman Avis Richards with the Ground Up Campaign Unbelievable Through her my kids the most disenfranchised and marginalized were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools That's triple bottom line Okay A year ago today I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense especially when the resources were free So thank you all and I love them They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health again free resources don't waste them And what do you know Six months later my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment The greenest class in New York City But more importantly is my kids learned to get they learned to give And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world So we started giving back And that's when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pockets then with the heart and then with the mind So we were onto something and we're still onto something And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine We're 3，000 strong right now And what does it really do It teaches kids to re-vision their communities so when they grow up in places like this they can imagine it like this And my kids trained and certified -- Ma you get the tax abatement Thank you Mayor Bloomberg -- can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that and that to me people is another true sí se puede moment Now how does it start It starts in schools No more little Knicks and little Nets Group by broccoli group by your favorite vegetable something you can aspire to Okay And these are my future farmers of America growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street the most migrant community in America When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this it's no wonder we get fruit like that And I love it And so do they And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down And that's a true sí se puede moment And again Brook Park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint The poorest congressional district in America the most migratory community in America we can do this Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions moving kids into an economy they never imagined Now somewhere over the rainbow my friends is the South Bronx of America And we're doing it How does it start Well look at Jose's attention to detail Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground and not aisle 9 at the supermarket or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam And when Henry knows that green is good so do I And when you expand their palates you expand their vocabulary And most importantly when you put big kids together with little kids you get the big fat white guy out of the middle which is cool and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers which is incredible God I'm going to run out of time so I've gotta keep it moving But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti This is what we're doing And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other I gotta tell you I'm a protective parent But those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent We're also becoming children of the corn creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer but I expect you to read about it write about it blog about it offer outstanding customer service I expect them to be engaged and man are they So that's my incredible classroom that's the food Where does it go Zero miles to plate right down into the cafeteria Or more importantly to local shelters where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day And we're stepping it up No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm And in his day a million dollar gardens and incredible installations Let me tell you something people This is a beautiful moment Black field brown field toxic waste field battlefield -- we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere on cement And we take orders for flowers I'm putting the bake sale to shame We take orders now I'm booking for the spring And these were all grown from seeds We're learning everything And again when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this we're really creating a moment Now you may ask about these kids Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance All start overage and under-credit They are now my first cohort is all in college earning a living wage The rest are scheduled to graduate this June Happy kids happy families happy colleagues Amazed people The glory and bounty that is Bronx County Let's talk about mint Where is my mint I grow seven kinds of mint in my class Mojitos anybody I'll be at Telepan later But understand this is my intellectual Viagra Ladies and gentlemen I gotta move quick but understand this: The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats is becoming home to

the day I'm Steve Ritz Sí se puede Some of you have heard the story before but in fact there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before so I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling this story I used to be a photographer for many years In 1978 I was working for Time magazine and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph Amerasian children children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia and then abandoned -- 40，000 children all over Asia I had never heard the word Amerasian before I spent a few days photographing children in different countries and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists I always hope that when my pictures were published they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it So I was so disturbed by what I saw and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards that I decided I would take six months off I was 28 years old I decided I would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time magazine In the course of doing the story I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids And a man told me who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea that there was a young girl who was 11 years old being raised by her grandmother And the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her Every time any Westerners came to the village she hid the girl And of course I was immediately intrigued I saw photographs of her and I thought I wanted to go And the guy just told me There's no way This grandmother won't even -- you know there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that's she's raising I took a translator with me and went to this village found the grandmother sat down with her And to my astonishment she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter And I was paying for this myself so I asked the translator if it would be OK if I stayed for the week I had a sleeping bag The family had a small shed on the side of the house so I said Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings And I just told the little girl whose name was Hyun-Sook Lee that if I ever did anything to embarrass her -- she didn't speak a word of English although she looked very American -- she could just put up her hand and say Stop and I would stop taking pictures And then my translator left So there I was I couldn't speak a word of Korean and this is the first night I met Hyun-Sook Her mother was still alive Her mother was not raising her her grandmother was raising her And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were The grandmother was incredibly fond deeply in love with this little girl They slept on the floor at night The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks under the floors so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor Hyun-Sook was 11 years old I had photographed as I said a lot of these kids Hyun-Sook was in fact the fifth child that I found to photograph And almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids And what struck me immediately in meeting Hyun-Sook was how confident she appeared to be how happy she seemed to be in her own skin And remember this picture because I'm going to show you another picture later but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother although she looks so Western I decided to follow her to school This is the first morning I stayed with her This is on the way to school This is the morning assembly outside her school And I noticed that she was clowning around When the teachers would ask questions she'd be the first person to raise her hand Again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that I'd photographed Again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions Getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears in the middle of class And one of the other things that I said to her through the translator -- again this thing about saying stop -- was to not pay attention to me And so she really just completely ignored me most of the time I noticed that at recess she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team It was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader This is on the way home And that's North Korea up along the hill This is up along the DMZ They would actually cover the windows every night so that light couldn't be seen because the South Korean government has said for years that the North Koreans may invade at any time So there's always this -- the closer you were to North Korea the more terrifying it was Very often at school I'd be taking pictures and she would whisper into her girlfriends' ears and then look at me and say Stop And I would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke The end of the week came and my translator came back because I'd asked her to come back so I could formally thank the grandmother and Hyun-Sook And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator the grandmother started crying And I said to my translator What's going on why is she crying And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment and then she started getting tears in her eyes And I said OK what did I do What's going on Why is everyone crying And the translator said The grandmother says that she thinks she's dying and she wants to know if you would take Hyun-Sook to America with you And I said I'm 28 years old and I live in hotels and I'm not married I mean I had fallen in love with this girl but I -- you know it was like emotionally I was about 12 years old If you know of photographers the joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented Sorry I have to go on an assignment I'll be back -- and then you never come back So I asked the translator why she thought she was dying Can I get her to a hospital Could I pay to get her a doctor And she refused any help at all And so when I got outside I actually gave the translator some money and said Please go back and see if you can do something And I gave the grandmother my business card And I said If you're serious I will try to find a family for her And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta Georgia who had an 11-year-old son And my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child So here my friends Gene and Gail had not heard from me in about a year and suddenly I was calling saying I'm in Korea and I've met this extraordinary girl And I said The grandmother thinks she's sick but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also And I said I'll pay for the 。。 I mean I had this whole sort of picture So anyway I left And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her And I said Look I think I'll scare the grandmother to death if I actually write to her and tell her that you're willing to adopt her I want to go back and talk to her But I was off on assignment I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother And on Christmas Day I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram -- back in those days you got telegrams -- from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died and left their child in a will to me Did I know anything about this Because I hadn't told them what I was doing because I was so upset with the story they'd run So I went back to Korea and I went back to Hyun-Sook's village and she was gone And the house that I had spent time in was empty It was incredibly cold No one in the village would tell me where Hyun-Sook was because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me So I finally found Myung Sung her best friend that she used to play with after school every day And Myung Sung under some pressure from me and the translator gave us an address on the outside of Seoul And I went to that address and knocked on the door and a man answered the door It was not a very nice area of Seoul as there were mud streets outside of it And I knocked on the door and Hyun-Sook answered the door and her eyes were bloodshot and she seemed to be in shock She didn't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean And I said to the translator What did he say And she said He wants to know who you are And I said Well tell him that I am a photographer I started explaining who I was and he interrupted And she said He says he knows who you are what do you want I said Well tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her And he said I'm her uncle she's fine you can leave now So I was -- you know the door was being slammed in my face it's incredibly cold and I'm trying to think What would the hero do in a movie if I was writing this as a movie script So I said Listen it's really cold I've come a very long way do you mind if I just come in for a minute I'm freezing So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor And as we started talking I saw him yell something and Hyun-Sook came and brought us some food And I had this whole mental picture of sort of like Cinderella I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn being enslaved by this family And I was really appalled and I couldn't figure out what to do And the more I tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting So I finally decided I said Look -- this is all through the translator because this is all you know I don't speak a word of Korean -- and I said Look I'm really glad that Hyun-Sook has a family to live with I was very worried about her I made a promise to her grandmother your mother that I would find a family and now I'm so happy that you're going to take care of her I said But you know I bought an airline ticket and I'm stuck here for a week And I said I'm staying in a hotel downtown Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow And you can practice your English Because he told me -- I was trying to ask him questions about himself And so I went to the hotel and I found two older Amerasians A girl whose mother had been a prostitute and she was a prostitute and a boy who'd been in and out of jail And I said to them Look there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America I said I don't know if it's the right decision or not but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living And just -- I want him to understand what happens if she stays here And I could be wrong I don't know but I wish you would come tomorrow So these two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant They were yelling at him they were -- it got to be really ugly And we went outside and he was just furious And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing Here I was again trying to figure out what to do And he started yelling at me and I said to the translator OK tell him to calm down what is he saying And she said Well he's saying 'Who the hell are you to walk into my house some rich American with your cameras around your neck accusing me of enslaving my niece This is my niece I love her she's my sister's daughter Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this？' And I said you know Look I said You're absolutely right I don't pretend to understand what's going on here I said All I know is I've been photographing a lot of these children I said I'm in love with your niece I think she's an incredibly special child And I said Look I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them I just think that -- what little I know about the situation she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have So everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing I could have possibly done because who's ever good enough for your relative But he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother And they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual And you can see how different she looks just in three months This was now I think February early February And the pictures before were taken in September Well there was an American Marine priest that I had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house He had three women helping him take care of these kids And so I suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet Father Keene to find out how the adoption process worked Because I wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board So this is on the way down to the orphanage This is Father Keene He's just a wonderful guy He had kids from all over Korea living there and he would find families for these kids This is a social worker interviewing Hyun-Sook Now I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and the person everybody -- throughout the day I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother And I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village they were one of the most respected families in the village And I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded and insisted that the villagers treat Hyun-Sook with the same respect they treated her Hyun-Sook stayed at Father Keene's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through He actually agreed to the adoption And I went off on assignment and came back a week later and Father Keene said I've got to talk to you about Hyun-Sook I kind of said Oh God now what And he takes me into this room and he closes the door and he says I have 75 children here in the orphanage and it's total bedlam And there's clothes and there's kids and you know there's three adults and 75 kids -- you can imagine And he said The second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids And she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day And he said She's telling me that I'm messy and I have to clean up my room And he said I don't know who raised her but he said she's running the orphanage and she's been here three days This was movie day -- that she organized -- where all the kids went to the movies A lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids telling them about what their life was like with their new families So it was a really big deal when the letters showed up This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted Gene and Gail started studying Korean the moment they had gotten my first letter They really wanted to be able to welcome Hyun-Sook into their family And one of the things Father Keene told me when I came back from one of these trips -- Hyun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha which I understood was from her watching a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon on the American Air Force station This may be one of those myth-buster things that we'll have to clear up here in a minute So my friend Gene flew over with his son Tim Gail couldn't come And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary And this was Gene showing the uncle where Atlanta was on the map where he lived This is the uncle signing the adoption papers Now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate The uncle went back to his family and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I went out to dinner And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons We went back to our hotel room and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was This is the third night we were in Korea The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us Now I'd been staying in this room for about three months -- it was a little 15-story Korean hotel So the second night we didn't keep the kids' room because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage And the third night we came back we'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said There's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there's a room there And Gene and I looked at each other and said No we don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away So his son said Dad I have a sleeping bag I'll sleep on the floor And I said Yeah I have one too So Tim and I slept on the floor Natasha got one bed Gene got the other -- kids pass out it's been very exciting for three days We're lying in bed and Gene and I are talking about how cool we are We said That was so great we saved this little girl's life We were just like you know ah just full of ourselves And we fall asleep -- and I've been in this room you know for a couple of months now And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly so during the day I always left the window open And then at night about midnight they turn the heat off in the hotel So at about 1 a。m。 the whole room would be like 20 below zero and I'd get up I'd been doing this every night I'd been there So sure enough it's one o'clock room's freezing I go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside and I thought Oh the bars must have just gotten out And I don't speak Korean but I'm hearing these voices and I'm not hearing anger I'm hearing terror So I open the window and I look out and there's flames coming up the side of our hotel and the hotel's on fire So I run over to Gene and I wake him up and I say Gene don't freak out I think the hotel's on fire And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we're on the eleventh floor So the two of us were just like Oh my God oh my God So we're trying to get Natasha up and we can't talk to her And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour it's like they took five Valiums -- you know they're all over the place And we can't talk to her I remember his son had the L。L Bean bootlaces and we're trying to do up his laces So we try to get to the door and we run to the door and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace There's people screaming there's the sound of glass breaking there's these weird thumps And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds And Gene turns around and says We're not going to make it And he closes the door and the whole room is now filled with smoke We're all choking and there's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors There's people screaming I just remember this unbelievable just utter chaos I remember sitting near the bed and I was just so -- I had two overwhelming feelings One was absolute terror -- it's like Oh please God I just want to wake up This has got to be a nightmare this can't be happening Please I just want to wake up it's got to be a nightmare And the other is unbelievable guilt Here I've been playing God with my friends' lives my friends' son with Natasha's life and this what you get when you try playing God is you hurt people I remember just being so frightened and terrified And Gene who's lying on the floor says Man we've got to soak towels I said What He says We've got to soak towels We're going to die from the smoke So we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces Then he said Do you have gaffer's tape I said What He said Do you have gaffer's tape I said Yeah somewhere in my Halliburton He says We've got to stop the smoke He said That's all we can do we've got to stop the smoke I mean Gene -- thank God for Gene So we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air And there was a building a new building going up that was being built right outside across the street from our hotel And there in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump Eleven people ended up dying in the fire Five people jumped and died other people were killed by the smoke And there's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this and people were shouting in Korean And I remember Natasha didn't want us opening the door -- sorry I was trying not to open the door because we'd spent so much time barricading the room I didn't know who it was I didn't know what they wanted and Natasha could tell they were firemen trying to get us out I remember a sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open In any case 12 hours later I mean they put us in the lobby Gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet People were lying on the floor It was one of just the most horrifying nights And then 12 hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to Natasha's village And we kept saying Do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight hours ago It's so weird how life just goes on Natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man's birthday This guy's 60 years old So it turned into a dual celebration because Natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the United States So these are the greenhouse tents This is the elders teaching Gene their dances We drank a lot of rice wine We were both so drunk I couldn't believe it This is the last picture before Gene and Tim headed back The adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through Like what could you do for a year So I found out the name of every official on both the Korean and American side and I photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done And four months later the adoption papers came through This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage This is Father Keene with Natasha at the bus stop Her great aunt at the airport I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines in return for photography It was like the ultimate perk And the pilot I actually knew -- because they used to let me sit in the jump seat to tell you how long ago this was This is a Tri-Star and so they let Natasha actually sit in the jump seat And the pilot Jeff Cowley actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha This is 28 hours later in Atlanta It's a very long flight Just to make things even crazier Gail Natasha's new mom was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter So you know if you were writing this you'd say No we've got to write the script differently This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts Gene and Gail know everyone in Atlanta -- they're the most social couple imaginable So at this point Natasha doesn't speak a word of English other than what little Father Keene taught her This is Kylie her sister who's now a doctor on the right This is a deal I had with Natasha which is that when we got to Atlanta she could take -- she could cut off my beard She never liked it very much She learned English in three months She entered seventh grade at her own age level Pledge of Allegiance for the first time This is her cooking teacher Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she wouldn't answer and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak English very well in the beginning But what I noticed again as an observer was she was choosing who was going to be on her team and seemed to be very popular very very quickly Now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning People were always telling Natasha how much she looks like her mother Gail This is a tense moment in the first football game I think And Kylie -- I mean it was almost like Kylie was her own child She's being baptized Now a lot of parents when they adopt actually want to erase their children's history And Gail and Gene did the complete opposite They were studying Korean; they bought Korean clothes Gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen which was that Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of Korea to live happily ever after in Atlanta She hates this picture -- it was her first job She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia with the money she made working at Burger King The captain of the cheerleaders Beauty pageant Used to do their Christmas card every year Gene's been restoring this car for a million years Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator for them at the Olympics in Korea Her future husband Jeff was working for Canon cameras and met Natasha at the Olympic Village This is her first trip back to Korea so there's her uncle This is her half-sister She went back to the village That's her best friend's mother And I always thought that was a very Annie Hall kind of outfit It's just you know it was just so interesting just to watch -- this is her mother in the background there This is Natasha's wedding day Gene is looking a little older This is Sydney who's going to be three years old in a couple of days And there's Evan Natasha would you just come up for a second just maybe to say hello to everybody Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story I mean she -- you know we've looked at the pictures together Natasha: I've seen pictures millions of times but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation I started crying Rick Smolan: I'm sure there's about 40 things she's going to tell me That wasn't what happened that wasn't what you said Natasha: Later I'll do that later RS: Anyway thank you Mike and Richard so much for letting us tell the story Thank you all of you Basking sharks are awesome creatures They are just magnificent They grow 10 meters long Some say bigger They might weigh up to two tons Some say up to five tons They're the second largest fish in the world They're also harmless plankton-feeding animals And they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive They're fantastic creatures And we're very lucky in Ireland we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them They were also very important to coast communities going back hundreds of years especially the around the Claddagh Duff Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way off shore sometimes to a place called the Sunfish Bank which is about 30 miles west of Achill Island to kill the basking sharks This is an old woodcut from the 17 1800s So they were very important and they were important for the oil out of their liver A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver and it's full of oil You get gallons of oil from their liver And that oil was used especially for lighting but also for dressing wounds and other things In fact the streetlights in 1742 of Galway Dublin and Waterford were linked with sunfish oil And sunfish is one of the words for basking sharks So they were incredibly important animals They've been around a long time have been very important to coast communities Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island And sharks used to come into the bay And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland string it out along the other net And as the shark came round it would hit the net the net would collapse on it It would often drown and suffocate Or at times they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor boil them up use the oil They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- it is the finning of sharks We're often all frightened of sharks thanks to Jaws Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year There was someone recently wasn't there Just a couple weeks ago We kill about 100 million sharks a year So I don't know what the balance is but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them It was a well-documented fishery and as you can see here it peaked in the 50s where they were killing 1，500 sharks a year And it declined very fast -- a classic boom and bust fishery which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates And they killed about 12，000 sharks in this period literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay at Achill Island Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s especially after places like Dunmore East in County Waterford And about two and a half 3，000 sharks were killed up till '85 many by Norwegian vessels The black you can't really see this but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language Now I don't pretend to have any Irish but in Kerry they were often known as Ainmhide na seolta the monster with the sails And another title would be Liop an da lapa the unwieldy beast with two fins Liabhan mor suggesting a big animal Or my favorite Liabhan chor greine the great fish of the sun And that's a lovely evocative name On Tory Island which is a strange place anyway they were known as muldoons and no one seems to know why Hope there's no one from Tory here; lovely place But more commonly all around the island they were known as the sunfish And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world Some people say it's not population decline It might be a change in the distribution of plankton And it's been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change because they're basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN There's also moves in Europe to try and stop catching them There's now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally They're not protected in Ireland In fact they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside We know very little about them And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface I only found out last year at a conference on the Isle of Man just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly frequently and predictably come to the surface to bask And it's a fantastic opportunity in science to see and experience basking sharks and they are awesome creatures And it gives us a fantastic opportunity to actually study them to get access to them So what we've been doing a couple of years -- but last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active And we tagged them very simply not very hi-tech with a big long pole This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end Go up in your boat and tag the shark And we were very effective We tagged 105 sharks last summer We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula Half the challenge is to get access is to be in the right place at the right time But it's a very simple and easy technique I'll show you what they look like We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark One is to try and work out the gender of the shark We also deployed a couple of satellite tags so we did use hi-tech stuff as well These are archival tags So what they do is they store the data A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite And of course sharks fish are underwater most of the time So this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun plus water temperature and depth And you have to kind of reconstruct the path What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period in this case it was eight months and literally to the day the tag popped off drifted up said hello to the satellite and sent not all the data but enough data for us to use And this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water And here's a couple of maps that we've done That one you can see that we tagged both off Kerry And basically it spent all its time the last eight months in Irish waters Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge And here's one that we haven't ground-truthed it yet with sea surface temperature and water depth but again the second shark kind of spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man all the way out to Nova Scotia in about 90 days That's nine and a half thousand kilometers We never thought that happened Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts and his tags didn't really work All he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off And his tags popped off in the Caribbean and even in Brazil And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude But in actual fact they're obviously crossing the Equator as well So very simple things like that we're trying to learn about basking sharks One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are Now I'm not a geneticist so I'm not going to pretend to understand the genetics And that's why it's great to have collaboration Whereas I'm a field person I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on -- take me away So we can work with geneticists who understand that So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks they found that the diversity was incredibly low If you look at the first line really you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar I think this means basically that they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry If you look at nucleotide diversity which is more genetics that are passed on through parents you can see that basking sharks if you look at the first study was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species And you see that this work was done in 2006 Before 2006 we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks We had no idea did they distinguish into different populations Were there subpopulations And of course that's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals So Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really So he did another study using microsatellites which are much more expensive much more time consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results So it does seem to be that basking sharks for some reason have incredibly low diversity And it's thought maybe it was a bottleneck a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12，000 years ago and this has caused a very low diversity And yet if you look at whale sharks which is the other plankton eating large shark its diversity is much greater So it doesn't really make sense at all They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks So even though basking sharks are found throughout the world you couldn't tell the difference genetically from one from the Pacific the Atlantic New Zealand or from Ireland South Africa They all basically seem the same But again it's kind of surprising You wouldn't really expect that I don't understand this I don't pretend to understand this And I suspect most geneticists don't understand it either but they produce the numbers So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size: 8，200 animals That's it 8，000 animals in the world You're thinking That's just ridiculous No way So Les did a finer study and he found out it came out about 9，000 And using different microsatellites gave the different results But the average of all these studies came out -- the mean is about 5，000 which I personally don't believe but then I am a skeptic But even if you toss a few numbers around you're probably talking of an effective population of about 20，000 animals Do you remember how many they killed off Achill there in the 70s and the 50s So what it tells us actually is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small In fact of those 20，000 8，000 were thought to be females There's only 8，000 basking shark females in the world I don't know I don't believe it The problem with this is they were constrained with samples They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail So where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis Well one obvious source is dead sharks Dead sharks washed up We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year if we're kind of lucky Another source would be fisheries bycatch We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets That's banned now and that'll be good news for the sharks And some are caught in nets in trawls This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas illegally because you're not allowed to do that under E。U law and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak They even put a recipe up on the wall until they were told this was illegal And they actually did get a fine for that So if you look at all those studies I showed you the total number of samples worldwide is 86 at present So it's very important work and they can ask some really good questions and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure but they're constrained by lack of samples Now when we were out tagging our sharks this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -- get in there fast -- occasionally the sharks do react And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail more I think in startle to the fact that a boat came near it rather than the tag going in And that was fine We got wet No problem And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head to the pier I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat And I remembered -- I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind So I was thinking that must have come from the shark Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable And we would use conventional methods -- I have a crossbow you see the crossbow in my hand there which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well So I tried that I tried many techniques All it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong There was no way we were going to get a sample from that So that wasn't going to work So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat I thought If you take what you're given in this world 。。 So I scraped it off And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen And I said You might try that And they sat on it for months actually It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man But I kept emailing saying Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet And he was like Yeah yeah yeah yeah Later later later Anyway he thought he'd better do it because I never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime And they amplified it and they tested it and they found yes this was actually basking shark DNA which was got from the slime And so he was all very excited It became known as Simon's shark slime And I thought Hey you know I can build on this So we thought okay we're going to try to get out and get some slime So having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags I then thought I'd invest 7。95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle and even less money on some oven cleaners And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the end of the mop handle and was desperate desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks Now this was into August now and normally sharks peak at June July And you rarely see them You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August So we were desperate So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see here's a shark that's running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime And here it is Look at that lovely black shark slime And in about half an hour we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's shark slime sampling system I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now and they're kind of a bit more dramatic You probably saw the humpback whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off County Wexford And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind And I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins But hey sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come So this is possibly going to be my legacy -- Simon's shark slime So we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples And one thing that is kind of very useful is that we use a pole cameras -- this is my colleague Joanne with a pole camera -- where you can actually look underneath the shark And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark So if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female Because at the moment they actually have no way genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female which I found absolutely staggering because they don't know what primers to look for And being able to tell the gender of a shark has got very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through societies because it is illegal to trade any sharks And they are caught and they are on the market So as a field biologist you just want to get encounters with these animals You want to learn as much as you can They're often quite brief They're often very seasonally constrained And you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines such as geneticists who can gain so much more from that So as I said these things are sent to you in strange ways Grab them while you can I'll take that as my scientific legacy Hopefully I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die But for the time being thank you for that And keep an eye out for sharks If you're more interested we have a basking shark website now just set up So thank you and thank you for listening Erez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true So we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT The American Heritage Dictionary The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors the Google And we cogitated about this for about four years And we came to a startling conclusion Ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words In fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history: change over time So many books actually have been written over the years So we were thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books Now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that which is the practical axis This is very very low Now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully This is extremely practical but not so awesome What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach They have digitized millions of books So what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button That's very practical and extremely awesome EL Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from Since time immemorial there have been authors These authors have been striving to write books And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago Since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books Now if those books are not lost to history then they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date Now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format Now we've got the data plus we have metadata We have information about things like where was it published who was the author when was it published And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data What we're left with is a collection of five million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which when written out would stretch from here to the Moon and back 10 times over -- a veritable shard of our cultural genome Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole 。。 was what any self-respecting researchers would have done We took a page out of XKCD and we said Stand back We're going to try science JM: Now of course we were thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it Now we're thinking what data can we release Well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books Now Google and Jon Orwant in particular told us a little equation that we should learn So you have five million that is five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit So although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical Now again we kind of caved in and we did the very practical approach which was a bit less awesome We said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books So take for instance A gleam of happiness It's four words; we call that a four-gram We're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram appeared in books in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing EL So those two billion lines we call them two billion n-grams What do they tell us Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends Let me give you an example Let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did And so I might say Yesterday I throve Alternatively I could say Yesterday I thrived Well which one should I use How to know As of about six months ago the state of the art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs What should I do And he'd tell you Well most people say thrived but some people say throve And you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say He'd say Well in my day most people throve but some thrived So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data Two rows from this table of two billion entries What you're seeing is year by year frequency of thrived and throve over time Now this is just two out of two billion rows So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide JM: Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words For instance this one If you just take influenza you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe EL If you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist EL You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing For instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 Pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 In 1700 in 1800 in 1900 no one cared Through the 30s and 40s no one cared Suddenly in the mid-40s there started to be a buzz People realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big But nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 People were walking around obsessed They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 In fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in '51 '52 '53 Finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé And just like that the bubble burst And the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts And because we have these nice charts we can measure things We can say Well how fast does the bubble burst And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely Equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year We are losing interest in the past more rapidly JM: Now a little piece of career advice So for those of you who seek to be famous we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on So if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you're still young it's really great Now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great heights like Mark Twain for instance: extremely famous But if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterward So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older Like for instance biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician If you do that you might think Oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s But guess what nobody will really care EL There are more sobering notes among the n-grams For instance here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall an artist born in 1887 And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person He gets more and more and more famous except if you look in German If you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterward And of course what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing Here's a simple way to do it Well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after So that's sort of what we expect And we compare that to the fame that we observe And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index If the suppression index is very very very small then you very well might be being suppressed If it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda JM: Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations So for instance here -- this suppression index is for 5，000 people picked in English books where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this basically tightly centered on one What you expect is basically what you observe This is distribution as seen in Germany -- very different it's shifted to the left People talked about it twice less as it should have been But much more importantly the distribution is much wider There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record EL So culturomics is what we call this method It's kind of like genomics Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome Culturomics is similar It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture Here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it Why can everyone do it Everyone can do it because three guys Jon Orwant Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer and they said This is so fun We have to make this available for people So in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n-gram immediately -- also browse examples of all the various books in which your n-gram appears JM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day and this is really the best of all the queries So people want to be their best put their best foot forward But it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all They didn't want to be their best they wanted to be their beft So what happened is of course this is just a mistake It's not that strove for mediocrity it's just that the S used to be written differently kind of like an F Now of course Google didn't pick this up at the time so we reported this in the science article that we wrote But it turns out this is just a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences EL People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes Actually we're not going to have to talk we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent This person was interested in the history of frustration There's various types of frustration If you stub your toe that's a one A argh If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass that's an eight A aaaaaaaargh This person studies all the arghs from one through eight A's And it turns out that the less-frequent arghs are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating -- except oddly in the early 80s We think that might have something to do with Reagan JM: There are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books That's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published It's a sizable chunk of human culture There's much more in culture: there's manuscripts there newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings These all happen to be on our computers on computers across the world And when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture Thank you very much I am going to speak about corruption but I would like to juxtapose two different things One is the large global economy the large globalized economy and the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern to shape this economy Because there is this asymmetry which creates basically failing governance Failing governance in many areas: in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment in the area of exploitation of women and children in the area of climate change in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy which is operating in a worldwide arena And I think corruption and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance Let me talk about my own experience I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa At that time I noticed that corruption that grand corruption that systematic corruption was undermining everything we were trying to do And therefore I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank our own projects our own programs against corruption but in general I thought We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption And as soon as I started this work I received a memorandum from the World Bank from the legal department first in which they said You are not allowed to do this You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank so I want you to stop your doings In the meantime I was chairing donor meetings for instance in which the various donors and many of them like to be in Nairobi -- it is true it is one of the unsafest cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable And in these donor meetings I noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients by the governments by promoters many of them representing suppliers from the North -- that the worst projects were realized first Let me give you an example: a huge power project 300 million dollars to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the most beautiful areas of western Kenya And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients nobody would buy the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects To the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups the Samburu and the Turkana in this area So everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools like hospitals and so on And yet we all rejected this project none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it and it was the first project to be implemented The good projects which we as a donor community would take under our wings they took years you know you had too many studies and very often they didn't succeed But these bad projects which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled -- they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks of supplier agencies of insurance agencies -- like in Germany Hermes and so on -- and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North Now these suppliers were our big companies They were the actors of this global market which I mentioned in the beginning They were the Siemenses of this world coming from France from the UK from Japan from Canada from Germany and they were systematically driven by systematic large-scale corruption We are not talking about 50，000 dollars here or 100，000 dollars there or one million dollars there No we are talking about 10 million 20 million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein of the president's ministers the high officials in the para-statal sectors This was the reality which I saw and not only one project like that: I saw I would say over the years I worked in Africa I saw hundreds of projects like this And so I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries which is the main reason for the misery for the poverty for the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world twice that number more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children still child mortality of more than 10 million people every year children dying before they are five years old: The cause of this is to a large extent grand corruption Now why did the World Bank not let me do this work I found out afterwards after I left under a big fight the World Bank The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay including Germany In Germany foreign bribery was allowed It was even tax-deductible No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed Not all of them but most of them And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin at the Villa Borsig we were told You cannot stop our German exporters from bribing because we will lose our contracts We will lose to the French we will lose to the Swedes we'll lose to the Japanese And therefore there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma which made it very difficult for an individual company an individual exporting country to say We are not going to continue this deadly disastrous habit of large companies to bribe So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure because even the powerful government which we have in Germany comparatively was not able to say We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad They needed help and the large companies themselves have this dilemma Many of them didn't want to bribe Many of the German companies for instance believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price so they are very competitive They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are but they were not allowed to show their strengths because the world was eaten up by grand corruption And this is why I'm telling you this: Civil society rose to the occasion We had this small NGO Transparency International They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma and we developed concepts of collective action basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing and to make a long story short we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters In 1997 a convention under the auspices of the OECD which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery Well thank you I mean it's interesting in doing this we had to sit together with the companies We had here in Berlin at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years And President von Weizsäcker by the way chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations And in the first session they all said This is not bribery what we are doing This is customary there This is what these other cultures demand They even applaud it In fact unclear still says this today And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing But in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries here in Germany or in the U。K。 and so on Cabinet ministers would admit this And in the final session at the Aspen Institute we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government at the time requesting that they participate in the OECD convention And this is in my opinion an example of soft power because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us We had a longer-term time perspective We had a broader geographically much wider constituency we were trying to defend And that's why the law has changed That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in In some other countries the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced And again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment In London for instance where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute 100 million British pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment This case they are not prosecuting in the UK Why Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain Civil society is pushing civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem also in the U。K。 and also in Japan which is not properly enforcing and so on In Germany we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention which is a subsequent convention We are Germany is not ratifying Why Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies In Germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant but you are allowed to bribe a deputy This is under German law allowed and the members of our parliament don't want to change this and this is why they can't sign the U。N convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world but not able to ratify the convention which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world I see my time is ticking Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance By now the United Nations is totally on our side The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn they became I would say the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem in the development of remedies in the implementation of reforms and then later in the monitoring of reforms Of course if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into this responsibility Not all civil society organizations are good The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO So we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself They have to have a much more transparent financial governance They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations We also need much more competence of civil society leaders This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general do not focus enough yet on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society But what I'm saying from my very practical experience: If civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular governments governments and their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world Thank you I'm a or was or kind of am a toy designer And before I was a toy designer oh I was a mime a street mime actually And then I was an entertainer I guess And before that I was a silversmith and before that I was -- I was out of the house at about 15 and a half and I never wound up going into college I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time I do now after learning about all the quantum stuff It's really cool Anyway I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design I'm in my garage making weird stuff And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table and he goes Pass Pass Pass You know you think it's so cool but they -- anyway I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in This is the name of my company Giving Toys So I used to work at Mattel actually And after I left Mattel I started all these hamburger makers and then got the license to make the maker So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes -- and this is a French fry maker little tiny food you can eat I beat up the pasta maker to make that Then this is a McNugget maker I think This now that's the McNugget maker and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie And let's see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat and you eat and you -- she's about 300 pounds now No she's not she's beautiful This is how they looked when they came out at the end These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this but it got me through Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold This is a squishy head for no apparent reason This is some effects that I did for Wig Rattle and Roll That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back That paid the rent for about a month This is a walking Barbie -- I said Oh this is it And they go Oh that's really nice and out it goes So this is some fighting robots I thought everyone would want these They fight they get back up you know Wouldn't this be cool And they made it into a toy and then they dropped it like a hot rock They're pretty cool This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing on my little pug seeing if this can really grab It does pretty good I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin It's how they see have those album things -- kids don't know what they are This is a clay maker You know I said -- I went to Play-Doh and said Look I can animate this They said Don't talk to us about Play-Doh And then I made a Lego animator I thought this would be so great And you know Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego That's the answer They know everything about it Then I started doing animatronics I loved dinosaurs I used to be in the film business kind of and actually Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was like 12 and anyway so then they said No you have to make two and they have to fight You know how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur This is me using unclear or 3-D Studio back in the '80s That's David Letterman You can see how old this stuff is That's my youngest cousin This is a segment called Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair My career basically peaked here And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor And I'm really not very good at it But the -- this is a guy named Dr Yatz who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot This is a -- you can see the little window there You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist Way ahead of my time here I love toys Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there I love toys OK so so that was a that was the first kind of a -- that was the first batch of products Most of them did not go You get one out of 20 one out of 30 products And every now and then we do something like a you know an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and -- and we'd make some money on that you know And we'd give it out But eventually we left L。A。 and we moved to Idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet And I started working on this project -- oh I have to tell you about this real quick Throughout this whole thing making toys I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows you know to find innovation And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something to me anyway And so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that's where I think innovation happens And actually this is to me how I can come up with great ideas But it's not how you actually get leverage Actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business And those three together I think give you leverage in the world But moving on So this is a quick tale I'm going to tell This is the Furby tale As he said I was co-inventor of the Furby I did the body and creature -- well you'll see So by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create robotic life forms or technology that has an emotional connection with the user So this is my family This is my wife Christi and Abby and Melissa and my 17-year-old now Emily who was just a pack of trouble All right there's that robot again I came out of the movie business as I said and I said let's make these animatronic robots Let's make these things And so I've always had a big interest in this This one actually didn't go anywhere but I got my feet wet doing this This is a smaller one and I have a little moving torso on there A little tiny guy walks along More servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff There's another one He actually has skeletor legs I think he's wearing there Oh this is a little pony little pony -- very cute little thing The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit working on the Microsoft Barney And this is a -- you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear And you know they had lots just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need I thought And then Microsoft can just fill a you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company But anyway a friend of mine and I Dave Hampton decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form And that's our little thirty-cent Mabuchi motor And so I have all these design books like I'm sure many of you have And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby -- I have kind of the art and science I have the why over here and the how over there I try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects Because they're not just bing ideas; you have to really dig deep in these things So there's some real pseudo-code over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that And originally Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom And then we said well you're going to feed him and he needs to talk and it got more complicated And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move and the body to move and the mouth to move And you know I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time Well I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback And that worked pretty well Then I started to get a little more realistic and I have to start drawing the stuff And there's my note to self at the top: lots of engineering So that turned out to be a little more than true There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff And then I've got to start building it so this is the real thing I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together And that's my little workshop And there's the first little cam that drove Furby And there's Furby on the half shell You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it And there I am I'm done There's my little Furby No it's a little robot on heroin or something I think So right now you see I love little robots So my wife says Well you may like it but nobody else will So she comes to the rescue This is my wife Christi who is just you know my muse and my partner for eternity here And she does drawings right She's an actual you know artist And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there He didn't test so well but I like him And then she started doing these other images At that time Beanie Babies was a big hit and we thought we'll do a bunch of different ones So here's a little pink one a little pouf on his head And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either I don't know why There's my favorite Demon Furby That was a good one Anyway finally settled on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character And there he is a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there I actually went to ToysRUs got a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this And since then every time I come home from ToysRUs with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house I have three girls and they just they -- it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there So a little tether coming off it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes It's just a little server control and I made a little video going: Hi my name's Furby and I'm good you know and then I'd reach my hand He'd -- you can tickle him When I put my hand up Ha ha ha ha and that's how we sold him And Hasbro actually said I meant Tiger Electronics at the time said Yeah we want to do this We have you know 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair and we're going to hire you guys to do this And so Dave and I got working Mostly me because it was all mechanics at this point So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do And I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that And we started -- this was way back before there was really much SLA going on not a lot of rapid prototyping We certainly didn't have the money to do this They only paid me like a little bit of money to do this so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant SLA plant that was down And they said Yeah well we'll run them So they ran all the shells for us which was nice of them And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard We snuck in on the weekend And so we just had a disc of the files But they have a closed system so you couldn't print the things out on the machine So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors And on the weekend we ran the parts for that So this is how they come out close to the end And then they looked like little Garfields there Eight months later -- you may remember this this was a -- total total total chaos For a while they were making two million Furbys a month They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be And Hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars And I just a little bit on each one So full circle -- why do I do this Why do you you know try to do this stuff And it's of course for your kids And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys And she still actually has those So I kind of retired and we're already living in paradise up in Boise on a river you know So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here Ivy Ross and we did Miracle Moves Baby made it in Wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff And then I started another company We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet won Best Innovations at CES but really I kind of slowed down and said OK I just 。。 After a while I had this old tape of this dinosaur and I gave it to this guy and this other guy saw it and then people started to want to do it And they said they'd spend all this time So I said OK let's try to do this dinosaur project The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today's technology And it's not really -- but as close as we can do And we're going to try to really pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive Not a robot that kind of does but let's really go for it So I picked a Camarasaurus because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these That's a juvenile And so we actually went in There's a book called Walking on Eggshells where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia And the picture from the book so when I -- I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can to copy that Very very obsessive There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry's correct And then I went in and measured all the geometry because I figured hey biomimicry If I do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing So there's the motor And about this time you know all these other people are starting to help Here's an example of what we did with the skull There's the skull there's my drawing of a skull There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue There's the mechanism that would go in there kind of a Geneva drive There's some Solid Works versions of it Here's some SLA parts of the same thing And then these are really crude pieces We were just doing some tests here There's the skull pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens And there's kind of the first exploded view or see-through view There's the first SLA version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth The servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles They had to fit within the envelope There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right All the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically And then of course you're not done yet You have to get the look for the skin The skin's a whole another thing probably the hardest part So you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character Now this is not -- we're character designers right And we're still trying to keep with the real character So now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay Now you start doing the sculpture for this And you can see we got a guy from -- who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything And then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting And then four years and 10 million dollars later we have a little Pleo John do you want to bring him up John Sosoka is our CTO and is really the man that's done most of the work with our 40-person company I'd like to give John a hand He never gets recognition This is John Sosoka So thank you John thank you and get back to work all right man All right -- -- no it's very painful so -- -- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages So when you first get them they're babies And you -- more you have them kind of the older they get and they kind of learn through their behavior So this one this one's actually asleep and -- hang on Pleo wake up Pleo come on So this guy's listening to my voice here But they have 40 sensors all over their body They have seven processors they have 14 motors they have -- but you don't care do you They're just cute right That's the idea that's the idea So you see -- hey come on Hey did you feel that There's something big and loud over here Hey That's good wake up wake up wake up Yeah they're like kids you know You yeah yeah Okay he's hungry I'll show you what he's been doing for for four years Here here here Have some money Pleo There you go That's what the investors think that it's just -- -- right right So they're really sweet little guys And we're hoping that -- you know our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love Now these are not robots they're kind of lovebots you know They do change over time But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring And we have a -- I have a little something here Now I do want to say that you know Ugobe is not there yet We've just opened the door and it's for all of you to step through it We did include some things that are hopefully useful Excuse me Pleo They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card so it's completely open architecture So anyone can plug him -- -- thank you This is John over here Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality You can make him bipolar or as someone said a -- -- you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them Kids can just drag and drop put in new sounds We -- actually it's very hard to keep people from doing this We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial and they're going Whassup you know You -- so it's -- yes he likes that So they're a handful We hope you get one I don't know what I'm missing to say but as a last thing I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our children's best friends And there's a lot of social responsibility in that That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving And so I just -- I hope we all dream well Thank you I was walking in the market one day with my wife and somebody stuck a cage in my face And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen There was a very sick orangutan baby my first encounter That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard uhh uhh and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap Of course the cage was salvaged I took up the little baby massaged her forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally This is Uce She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain and this is Matahari her second son which by the way is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued Dodoy That changed my life quite dramatically and as of today I have almost 1，000 babies in my two centers No No No Wrong It's horrible It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild It's not good This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together just now like victims for every baby six have disappeared from the forest The deforestation especially for oil palm to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat the largest accumulation of organic material in the world When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world after China and the United States And we don't have any industry at all -- it's only because of this deforestation And these are horrible images I'm not going to talk too long about it but there are so many of the family of Uce which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest that still have to go through that process And I don't know anymore where to put them So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing in that way the loss of habitat and all those victims So I created the place Samboja Lestari and the idea was if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left no one will have an excuse to say Yeah but 。。 No Everyone should be able to follow this So we're in East Borneo This is the place where I started As you can see there's only yellow terrain There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there There was a huge amount of crime People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water There was no agricultural productivity left This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife This was like a biological desert When I stood there in the grass it's hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass Still four years later we have created jobs for about 3，000 people The climate has changed I will show you: no more flooding no more fires It's no longer the poorest district and there is a huge development of biodiversity We've got over 1，000 species We have 137 bird species as of today We have 30 species of reptiles So what happened here We created a huge economic failure in this forest So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm But we saw the same thing We had slash and burn agriculture; people cannot afford the fertilizer so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there; the fires become more frequent and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left There are no trees left Still in this place in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill four years later there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface 。。 And there are all these animals and all these people happy and there's this economic value So how's this possible It was quite simple If you'll look at the steps: we bought the land we dealt with the fire and then only we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that The people would become the defenders of that forest So we do the people profit planet principles but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state people say It belongs to me it belongs to everyone And then we apply all these other principles like transparency professional management measurable results scalability unclear etc What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out Now in this recipe you also have the cost You also know how much labor is needed If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil on a clay soil on a steep slope on flat soil you put those different recipes; if you combine them out of that comes a business plan comes a work plan and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have and you can do it This is how it looks like in practice We have this grass we want to get rid of It exudes unclear-like compounds from the roots The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is if you can preserve it in the right way which we can do with bamboo peels It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again So we plant it later along the waterways to filter the water provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available So the idea is: how to integrate these flows in space over time and with the limited means you have So we plant the trees we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between to reduce the competition for the trees the crop fertilizer Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops for the people but also helps the trees The farmers have free land the system yields early income the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money So beautiful What a theory But is it really that easy Not really because if you looked at what happened in 1998 the fire started This is an area of about 50 million hectares January February March April May We lost 5。5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months This is because we have 10，000 of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States And once the soil gets dried you're in a dry season -- you get cracks oxygen goes in flames come out and the problem starts all over again So how to break that cycle Fire is the biggest problem This is what it looked like for three months For three months the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark We lost all the crops No children gained weight for over a year; they lost 12 IQ points It was a disaster for orangutans and people So these fires are really the first things to work on That was why I put it as a single point up there And you need the local people for that because these grasslands once they start burning 。。 It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there So you have to do it with the local people That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution So what we did is we created a ring of sugar palms around the area These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people This is what it looks like: the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water carbon dioxide rain fall and a little bit of sunshine In principle you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells And you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year because you can tap them on a daily basis You don't need to harvest unclear or any other of the crops So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics which is still unexploited and doing it in combination with technology But also your legal side needs to be in very good order So we bought that land and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil and we were actually monitoring measuring every single tree in these 2，000 hectares 5，000 acres And this forest is quite different What I really did was I just followed nature and nature doesn't know monocultures but a natural forest is multilayered That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light it can store more carbon in the system it can provide more functions But it's more complicated It's not that simple and you have to work with the people So just like nature we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that we grow the slower growing primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light Then what is just as important: get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours And they become like nutrient pumps You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen and without those microorganisms you won't have any performance at all And then we started planting -- only 1，000 trees a day We could have planted many many more but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation And we do a lot of work here We use indicator plants to look at what soil types or what vegetables will grow or what trees will grow here And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space This is what it looks like in reality; you have this irregular ring around it with strips of 100 meters wide with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families It's only a small part of the area The nursery in here is quite different If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe for instance from the Urals up to England you know how many 165 In this nursery we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species Can you imagine You do need to know what you are working with but it's that diversity which makes it work That you can go from this zero situation by planting the vegetables and the trees or directly the trees in the lines in that grass there putting up the buffer zone producing your compost and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used In the beginning maybe pineapples and beans and corn; in the second phase there will be bananas and papayas; later on there will be chocolate and chilies And then slowly the trees start taking over bringing in produce from the fruits from the timber from the fuel wood And finally the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income On the top left underneath those green stripes you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before So this is after one year And this is after two years And that's green If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas the papayas all the crops for the local people but the trees are growing up fast in between as well And three years later 137 species of birds are living here So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius Air humidity is up 10 percent Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up Rainfall is up And all these species and income This ecolodge that I built here three years before was an empty yellow field This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon how the forest is developing and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology We actually have it already with Google Earth If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks and use Google Earth in combination with that you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced which company is stealing the timber and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here So this is the Samboja Lestari area You measure how the trees grow back but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced how many medicines can be kept here And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water; it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater and we have now a lot of intrusion there Now we looked at the clouds above this forest; we looked at the reforestation area the semi-open area and the open area And look at these images I'll just run them very quickly through In the tropics raindrops are not formed from ice crystals which is the case in the temperate zones you need the trees with unclear chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate and you have the trees to initiate the rain And look there's now 11。2 percent more clouds -- already after three years If you look at rainfall it was already up 20 percent at that time Let's look at the next year and you can see that that trend is continuing Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall that cap is now widening and getting higher And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari it used to be the driest place but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there So you can actually change the climate When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears but afterwards as soon as the wind stabilizes you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies And it's nice to have the science but it still depends mostly upon the people on your education We have our farmer schools But the real success of course is our band -- because if a baby is born we will play so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family This is how it looks We have this road going around the area which brings the people electricity and water from our own area We have the zone with the sugar palms and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart And inside we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared All the seeds get eaten So now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers satellites ultralights Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one then you underplanted with the sugar palms and you plant this thorny fence And after a few years you can remove some of those shade trees The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel and they can build a house they have some fuel wood to cook with And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like They have enough income for three families But whatever you do in that program it has to be fully supported by the people meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local cultural values There is no simple one recipe for one place You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it's transparent Like here in Samboja Lestari we divide that ring in groups of 20 families If one member trespasses the agreement and does cut down trees the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him If the group doesn't take action the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system In summary if you look at it in year one the people can sell their land to get income but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation the working with the orangutans and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft They also get free land in between the trees where they can grow their crops They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project They get building material for houses a contract for selling the sugar so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally They get all these other benefits: environmentally money they get education -- it's a great deal And everything is based upon that one thing -- make sure that forest remains there So if we want to help the orangutans -- what I actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit Now I think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration I hope -- if you want to know more you can read more Good morning How are you It's been great hasn't it I've been blown away by the whole thing In fact I'm leaving There have been three themes haven't there running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here Just the variety of it and the range of it The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future No idea how this may play out I have an interest in education -- actually what I find is everybody has an interest in education Don't you I find this very interesting If you're at a dinner party and you say you work in education -- actually you're not often at dinner parties frankly if you work in education You're not asked And you're never asked back curiously That's strange to me But if you are and you say to somebody you know they say What do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face They're like Oh my God you know Why me My one night out all week But if you ask about their education they pin you to the wall Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people am I right Like religion and money and other things I have a big interest in education and I think we all do We have a huge vested interest in it partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp If you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years' time And yet we're meant to be educating them for it So the unpredictability I think is extraordinary And the third part of this is that we've all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation I mean Sirena last night was a marvel wasn't she Just seeing what she could do And she's exceptional but I think she's not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent And my contention is all kids have tremendous talents And we squander them pretty ruthlessly So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status Thank you That was it by the way Thank you very much So 15 minutes left Well I was born 。。 no I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson She was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did The teacher was fascinated and she went over to her and she said What are you drawing And the girl said I'm drawing a picture of God And the teacher said But nobody knows what God looks like And the girl said They will in a minute When my son was four in England -- actually he was four everywhere to be honest If we're being strict about it wherever he went he was four that year He was in the Nativity play Do you remember the story No it was big It was a big story Mel Gibson did the sequel You may have seen it: Nativity II But James got the part of Joseph which we were thrilled about We considered this to be one of the lead parts We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: James Robinson IS Joseph He didn't have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in They come in bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and myrrh This really happened We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said You OK with that And he said Yeah why Was that wrong They just switched that was it Anyway the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down and the first boy said I bring you gold And the second boy said I bring you myrrh And the third boy said Frank sent this What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance If they don't know they'll have a go Am I right They're not frightened of being wrong Now I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative What we do know is if you're not prepared to be wrong you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong And by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity They have become frightened of being wrong And we run our companies like this by the way We stigmatize mistakes And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities Picasso once said this -- he said that all children are born artists The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up I believe this passionately that we don't grow into creativity we grow out of it Or rather we get educated out if it So why is this I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago In fact we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was Actually we lived in a place called Snitterfield just outside Stratford which is where Shakespeare's father was born Are you struck by a new thought I was You don't think of Shakespeare having a father do you Do you Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child do you Shakespeare being seven I never thought of it I mean he was seven at some point He was in somebody's English class wasn't he How annoying would that be Must try harder Being sent to bed by his dad you know to Shakespeare Go to bed now to William Shakespeare and put the pencil down And stop speaking like that It's confusing everybody Anyway we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles and I just want to say a word about the transition actually My son didn't want to come I've got two kids He's 21 now; my daughter's 16 He didn't want to come to Los Angeles He loved it but he had a girlfriend in England This was the love of his life Sarah He'd known her for a month Mind you they'd had their fourth anniversary because it's a long time when you're 16 Anyway he was really upset on the plane and he said I'll never find another girl like Sarah And we were rather pleased about that frankly because she was the main reason we were leaving the country But something strikes you when you move to America and when you travel around the world: Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects Every one Doesn't matter where you go You'd think it would be otherwise but it isn't At the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities and the bottom are the arts Everywhere on Earth And in pretty much every system too there's a hierarchy within the arts Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics Why Why not I think this is rather important I think math is very important but so is dance Children dance all the time if they're allowed to we all do We all have bodies don't we Did I miss a meeting Truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up And then we focus on their heads And slightly to one side If you were to visit education as an alien and say What's it for public education I think you'd have to conclude -- if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything that they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors Isn't it They're the people who come out the top And I used to be one so there And I like university professors but you know we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement They're just a form of life another form of life But they're rather curious and I say this out of affection for them There's something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them but typically -- they live in their heads They live up there and slightly to one side They're disembodied you know in a kind of literal way They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads don't they It's a way of getting their head to meetings If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night And there you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability And there's a reason The whole system was invented -- around the world there were no public systems of education really before the 19th century They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas Number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that Is that right Don't do music you're not going to be a musician; don't do art you won't be an artist Benign advice -- now profoundly mistaken The whole world is engulfed in a revolution And the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities designed the system in their image If you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance And the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued or was actually stigmatized And I think we can't afford to go on that way In the next 30 years according to UNESCO more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history More people and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population Suddenly degrees aren't worth anything Isn't that true When I was a student if you had a degree you had a job If you didn't have a job it's because you didn't want one And I didn't want one frankly But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA and now you need a PhD for the other It's a process of academic inflation And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence We know three things about intelligence One it's diverse We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it We think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically We think in abstract terms we think in movement Secondly intelligence is dynamic If you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive The brain isn't divided into compartments In fact creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things The brain is intentionally -- by the way there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum It's thicker in women Following off from Helen yesterday I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking Because you are aren't you There's a raft of research but I know it from my personal life If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often thankfully But you know she's doing -- no she's good at some things -- but if she's cooking you know she's dealing with people on the phone she's talking to the kids she's painting the ceiling she's doing open-heart surgery over here If I'm cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phone's on the hook if she comes in I get annoyed I say Terry please I'm trying to fry an egg in here Give me a break Actually you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen Remember that old chestnut I saw a great t-shirt really recently which said If a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong And the third thing about intelligence is it's distinct I'm doing a new book at the moment called Epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent I'm fascinated by how people got to be there It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of; she's called Gillian Lynne -- have you heard of her Some have She's a choreographer and everybody knows her work She did Cats and Phantom of the Opera She's wonderful I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet in England as you can see Anyway Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said Gillian how'd you get to be a dancer And she said it was interesting; when she was at school she was really hopeless And the school in the '30s wrote to her parents and said We think Gillian has a learning disorder She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting I think now they'd say she had ADHD Wouldn't you But this was the 1930s and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point It wasn't an available condition People weren't aware they could have that Anyway she went to see this specialist So this oak-paneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on little kid of eight -- in the end the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said Gillian I've listened to all these things that your mother's told me and I need to speak to her privately He said Wait here We'll be back; we won't be very long and they went and left her But as they went out the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk And when they got out the room he said to her mother Just stand and watch her And the minute they left the room she said she was on her feet moving to the music And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said Mrs Lynne Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer Take her to a dance school I said What happened She said She did I can't tell you how wonderful it was We walked in this room and it was full of people like me People who couldn't sit still People who had to move to think Who had to move to think They did ballet; they did tap; they did jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history; she's given pleasure to millions; and she's a multi-millionaire Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down Now I think 。。 What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity And for the future it won't serve us We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk who said If all the insects were to disappear from the earth within 50 years all life on Earth would end If all human beings disappeared from the earth within 50 years all forms of life would flourish And he's right What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future By the way -- we may not see this future but they will And our job is to help them make something of it Thank you very much Anyone in the room thought about sex today Yeah you did Thank you for putting your hand up over there Well I'm here to provide you with some biological validation for your sordid daydreams I'm here to tell you a few things that you might not have known about wild sex Now when humans think about sex male and female forms are generally what come to mind but for many millions of years such specific categories didn't even exist Sex was a mere fusion of bodies or a trickle of DNA shared between two or more beings It wasn't until about 500 million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives DNA out and a vagina something that receives it Now invariably you're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species these very familiar structures but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing Penile diversity is especially profuse So this is a paper nautilus It's a close relative of squid and octopus and males have a hectocotylus Just what is a hectocotylus A detachable swimming penis It leaves the body of the male finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm For many decades biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether Now the tapir is a mammal from South America And the tapir has a prehensile penis It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus not to mention it's a pretty good size The biggest penis in the animal kingdom however is not that of the tapir The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle Mm-hm So with all of this diversity in structure one might think then that penises are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place for the purposes of successful reproduction Simply insert part A into slot B and we should all be good to go But of course that doesn't exactly happen and that's because we can't just take form into account We have to think about function as well and when it comes to sex function relates to the contributions made by the gametes or the sperm and the eggs And these contributions are far from equal Eggs are very expensive to make so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with Sperm on the other hand is abundant and cheap so it makes more sense for males to have a more-sex-is-better strategy when it comes to siring members of future generations So how do animals cope with these very incongruent needs between the sexes I mean if a female doesn't choose a particular male or if she has the ability to store sperm and she simply has enough then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things: avoiding predators taking care of offspring gathering and ingesting food This is of course bad news for any male who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies for successful fertilization This is bedbug sex and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination Males have a spiked barbed penis that they literally stab into the female and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina They stab it anywhere in her body and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries If a female gets too many stab wounds or if a stab wound happens to become infected she can actually die from it Now if you've ever been out for a nice peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex you've undoubtedly been alarmed because it looks like gang rape And quite frankly that's exactly what it is A group of males will grab a female hold her down and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second Now the female actually gets the last laugh though because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries Now I like to share stories like this with my audiences because yeah we humans we tend to think sex sex is fun sex is good there's romance and there's orgasm But orgasm didn't actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that There are some more primitive ways of pleasing one's partner Earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones It's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different Those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all So going back to our biological minds then we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages because she can use her time for other things: avoiding predators taking care of young finding and ingesting food But biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages Why do they do this Well according to the biological literature During copulation the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract Mm-hm These are Mexican guppies and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments and these filaments basically form a fish mustache if you will Now males have been observed to prod the female's genital opening prior to copulating with her and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum P。I hypothesis females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches A little guppy porn for you right there So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex We've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner Now unfortunately in the animal kingdom it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again It's very common in many phyla from invertebrates to avian species mammals and of course even in primates Now interestingly there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place Female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally much like a penis and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside-out it in her own body I mean imagine putting a penis into another penis It's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action Now even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal: they're run by females groups of females sisters aunts and offspring and when young males attain sexual maturity they're turfed out of the group In hyena societies adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale They can take part in a kill only after everybody else including the offspring So it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male you take away all the social power he has So what are my take-home messages from my talk today Well sex is just so much more than insert part A into slot B and hope that the offspring run around everywhere The sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve So it may not be surprising to any of you that animals including ourselves spend a good amount of time thinking about sex but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it So thank you and happy daydreaming I work with a species called Bonobo And I'm happy most of the time because I think this is the happiest species on the planet It's kind of a well-kept secret This species lives only in the Congo And they're not in too many zoos because of their sexual behavior Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with But -- actually we have a lot to learn from them because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside It permeates their entire life And it's used for communication And it's used for conflict resolution And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts We divided our world up with lots of categories And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit But I don't think that we were that way initially There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there's something very very special about man Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics Well I don't know There were Tasmanians who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire They had no stone tools To our knowledge they had no music So when you compare them to the Bonobo the Bonobo is a little hairier He doesn't stand quite as upright But there are a lot of similarities And I think that as we look at culture we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are And I don't really think it's in our biology; I think we've attributed it to our biology but I don't really think it's there So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the Bonobo This is Kanzi He's a Bonobo Right now he's in a forest in Georgia His mother originally came from a forest in Africa And she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven years of age Now this shows a Bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left Clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking The Bonobo although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright just as we are This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy As you can see there's not a lot of difference between the way a Bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked As they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier And now we see all four The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa in the jungle encircled by the Congo River Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters 130 feet grow densely in the area It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo almost three decades ago Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee Slim-bodied Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally What's more they are able to walk upright for long distances Susan Savage-Rumbaugh Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame SS: This is Kanzi and I in the forest None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained None of them are tricks They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by NHK of Japan We have eight Bonobos Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire SS: An entire family at our research centre You going to help get some sticks Good We need more sticks too I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one That's a wasps' nest You can get it out I hope I have a lighter You can use the lighter to start the fire SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire He doesn't do it yet without a lighter but I think if he saw someone do it he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter He's learning about how to keep a fire going He's learning the uses for a fire just by watching what we do with fire This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo These are happy vocalizations You're happy You're very happy about this part You've got to put some water on the fire You see the water Good job SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack But he likes to carry things from place to place Austin I hear you saying Austin SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab long-distance farther than we can hear This is his sister This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart Goodbye SS: She's got the pedals down but not the wheel She switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel rather than turns it Like us she knows that that individual in the mirror is her By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution His name is Nyota It means star in Swahili Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors In the wild the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring Here Panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom Nyota Very impressive Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself Realizing that Nyota might get hurt Panbanisha like any human mother carefully tugs to get the scissors back He can now cut through tough animal hide SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools Kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows he can make much larger sharper flakes Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough The tough hide is difficult to cut even with a knife The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making but difficult to handle requiring great skill Kanzi's rock is from Gona Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago These are the rocks Kanzi used and these are the flakes he made The flat sharp edges are like knife blades Compare them to the tools our ancestors used; they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods She keeps staring out the window SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do For several days now Panbanisha has not been outside SS: I normally talk about language Then Panbanisha does something unexpected SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do I haven't told you that these apes have language It's a geometric language She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor What is she writing SS: She's also saying the name of that with her voice Now she comes up to Dr Sue and starts writing again SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard They speak when she touches them Panbanisha is communicating to Dr Sue where she wants to go A frame represents a hut in the woods Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor SS Very nice Beautiful Panbanisha SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods The curved line is very similar to the lexigram The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents collar It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out SS: That's an institutional requirement This symbol is not as clear as the others but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk Panbanisha watched Soon she began to write as well The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world How did they develop SS We found that the most important thing for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them It's simply to use language around them because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you Once you have that capacity the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica until Nyota now one year old steals it Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth Is he looking for where the sound came from Dr Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano She wasn't forced to learn the piano; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest Researcher: Go ahead Go ahead I'm listening Do that real fast part that you did Yeah that part Kanzi plays the xylophone; using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr Sue's singing Kanzi and Panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities Researcher: OK now get the monsters Get them Take the cherries too Now watch out stay away from them now Now you can chase them again Time to chase them Now you have to stay away Get away Run away Run Now we can chase them again Go get them Oh no Good Kanzi Very good Thank you so much None of us Bonobo or human can possibly even imagine SS: So we have a bi-species environment we call it a panhomoculture We're learning how to become like them We're learning how to communicate with them in really high-pitched tones We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild And they're learning to become like us Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species Thank you I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now that we think is going to change the way that computer games and Hollywood movies are being made That technology is simulating humans It's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body Now before I talk more about that technology let's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games This is a clip from a game called Grand Theft Auto 3 We already saw that briefly yesterday And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game It's one of the most successful games of all time But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive They pretty much look the same I've made him run into a wall here over and over again And you can see he looks always the same The reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters They are a graphical visualization of a character To produce these animations an animator at a studio has to anticipate what's going to happen in the actual game and then has to animate that particular sequence So he or she sits down animates it and tries to anticipate what's going to happen and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game Now the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity All you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in terms of the character what you actually put into it There's no real emergence there And thirdly as I said most of the animations are very repetitive because of that Now the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body And maybe if I could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because I mean it's very very trivial If I push Chris a bit like this for example he'll react to it If I push him from a different angle he'll react to it differently and that's because he has a physical body and because he has the motor skills to control that body It's a very trivial thing It's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all Thank you very much That's it Torsten Reil: That's it yes So that's what we're trying to simulate -- not Chris specifically I should say but humans in general Now we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University and we tried to start very simply What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk That stick figure is physically stimulated You can see it here on the screen So it's subject to gravity has joints etc If you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work And for that we use the neural network which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans It's called the central pattern generator So we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms We heard about those already yesterday and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already But just briefly the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning You hook these up -- in this case to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting At the beginning they're all going to be very boring Most of them won't move at all but some of them might make a tiny step Those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well And you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks -- in this case in a straight line like this So that was the idea behind this When we started this I set up the simulation one evening It took about three to four hours to run the simulation I got up the next morning went to the computer and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like I've just demonstrated and this is what I got instead So it was back to the drawing board for us We did get it to work eventually after tweaking a bit here and there And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run So what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution At the beginning it can't walk at all but it will get better and better over time So this is the one that can't walk at all Now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there But now after generation 20 it actually walks in a straight line without falling over That was the real breakthrough for us It was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it Now at this stage it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds What you see here is the character standing there and there's an obstacle that we put in its way And what you see is it's going to fall over the obstacle Now the interesting bit is if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which is what I'm doing now here it will fall over it in a completely different way And again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it'll again fall differently Now what you see by the way at the top there are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles Okay That's the video Thanks Now this might look kind of trivial but it's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds Now at this stage we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple blocky biped What we really wanted was a full human body So we started the company We hired a team of physicists software engineers and biologists to work on this and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body basically It's got to be relatively fast so you can run it on a normal machine but it's got to be accurate enough so it looks good enough basically So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing and tried to make it as realistic as possible What you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair clothes etc。 but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement Now what I'm going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens Nothing really interesting basically It falls over but it falls over like a rag doll basically The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it So this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet in this particular one But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed It's going to stick out its hands It's going to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall So that's what you see here Now it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well So here we've got the same character I'm going to push it a bit harder now harder than I just pushed Chris But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left What you see is it takes steps backwards it tries to counter-balance it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land I'll show you this again And then finally hits the floor Now this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions again just as I've done That's something that you cannot do right now At the moment you only have empty computer graphics in games What this is now is a real simulation That's what I want to show you now So here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you but now I'm just going to push it from different directions First starting with a push from the right This is all slow motion by the way so we can see what's going on Now the angle will have changed a tiny bit so you can see that the reaction is different Again a push now this time from the front And you see it falls differently And now from the left -- and it falls differently That was really exciting for us to see that That was the first time we've seen that This is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode I haven't shown this to anybody yet Now just a fun thing: what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it but it's got the same AI in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface like ice We just did that for a laugh just to see what happens And this is what happens It's nothing we had to do about this We just took this character that I just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach Now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology we got a very good response And what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen Because stunts are obviously very dangerous they're very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do obviously because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt So they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that's what we've been working on for the past few months And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks So here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked That's what people want That's what we're giving them You can see it's always reacting This is not a dead body This is a body who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head Only I think it's quite a big blow again You feel kind of sorry for that thing and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more There are much worse videos than this by the way which I have taken out but 。。 Now here's another one What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion a strong force applied to the character and have the character react to it in midair So that you don't have a character that looks limp but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well So this character is going to be hit by a force it's going to realize it's in the air and it's going to try and well stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing That's one angle; here's another angle We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London who are using our software and experimenting with it right now So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly better rendered version So if you look at the character carefully you see there are lots of body movements going on none of which you have to animate like in the old days Animators had to actually animate them This is all happening automatically in the simulation This is a slightly different angle and again a slow motion version of this This is incredibly quick This is happening in real time You can run this simulation in real time in front of your eyes change it if you want to and you get the animation straight out of it At the moment doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days This is another behavior they requested I'm not quite sure why but we've done it anyway It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach In this case the character's hands are fixed to a particular point in space and all we've told the character to do is to struggle And it looks organic It looks realistic You feel kind of sorry for the guy It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically Now I'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel how realistic it can look And this is all a physical simulation of the body using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body Now one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee Got a very short clip here Yes you can just about see it here In this case they were using a real stunt man It was a very dangerous stunt It was just voted I think in the Sunday Times as one of the most impressive stunts Now we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves Can we do that ourselves as well Can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial intelligence put that artificial intelligence into the character drive virtual muscles simulate the way he jumps off the dam and then skydive afterwards and have him caught by a bungee afterwards We did that It took about altogether just two hours pretty much to create the simulation And that's what it looks like here Now this could do with a bit more work It's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we'd get out of it But what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before There's so many things we can do with this right now The first thing as I said is going to be virtual stuntmen Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen and they're going to hit the screen quite soon actually for some major productions The second thing is video games With this technology video games will look different and they will feel very different For the first time you'll have actors that really feel very interactive that have real bodies that really react I think that's going to be incredibly exciting Probably starting with sports games which are going to become much more interactive But I particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds like there for example that Tom Melcher has shown us The degree of interactivity you're going to get is totally different I think from what you're getting right now A third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation We've been approached by several simulation companies but one project we're particularly excited about which we're starting next month is to use our technology -- and in particular the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy to predict the outcome of operations on these children As you probably know it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait The classic quote is I think it's unpredictable at best is what people think right now is the outcome Now what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait before he actually commits to an actual surgery That's one project we're particularly excited about and that's going to start next month Just finally this is only just the beginning We can only do several behaviors right now The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body The body yes but not all the motor skills that we have And I think we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing Right now we don't have that but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage We do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing I'm going to show you This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved I should say -- to produce balance basically So you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance That's what we thought was going to come out of this But this is what emerged out of it in the end Bizarrely this thing doesn't have a head I'm not quite sure why So this was not something we actually put in there He just started to create that dance himself He's actually a better dancer than I am I have to say And what you see after a while -- I think he even goes into a climax right at the end And I think -- there you go So that all happened automatically We didn't put that in there That's just the simulation creating this itself basically So it's just -- Thanks Not quite John Travolta yet but we're working on that as well so thanks very much for your time Thanks Incredible That was really incredible Thanks I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four Because of the coup d'état my family had to leave my native home of Ghana and move to the Gambia As luck would have it six months after we arrived they too had a military coup I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house For a week we slept under our beds because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window Then at the age of eight we moved to Botswana This time it was different There were no coups Everything worked Great education They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had a fiber-optic telephone system long before it had reached Western countries The only thing they didn't have is that they didn't have their own national television station and so I remember watching TV from neighboring South Africa and watching Nelson Mandela in jail being offered a chance to come out if he would give up the apartheid struggle But he didn't He refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing South Africa from apartheid And I remember feeling how just one good leader could make such a big difference in Africa Then at the age of 12 my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe Initially this too was amazing: growing economy excellent infrastructure and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in Africa I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college Six years later I returned to the country Everything was different It had shattered into pieces Millions of people had emigrated the economy was in a shambles and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years of development had been wiped out How could a country go so bad so fast Most people would agree that it's all because of leadership One man President Robert Mugabe is almost single-handedly responsible for having destroyed this country Now all these experiences of living in different parts of Africa growing up did two things to me The first is it made me fall in love with Africa Everywhere I went I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people and at the time I realized that I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to making this continent great But I also realized that making Africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership You see all these countries I lived in the coups d'état and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia and in Zimbabwe contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen in Botswana and in South Africa of good leadership It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders Now one might think of course leadership matters everywhere But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today it is this: In Africa more than anywhere else in the world the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere else and here's why It's because in Africa we have weak institutions like the judiciary the constitution civil society and so forth So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in: When societies have strong institutions the difference that one good leader can make is limited but when you have weak institutions then just one good leader can make or break that country Let me make it a bit more concrete You become the president of the United States You think Wow I've arrived I'm the most powerful man in the world So you decide perhaps let me pass a law All of a sudden Congress taps you on the shoulder and says No no no no no you can't do that You say Let me try this way The Senate comes and says Uh-uh we don't think you can do that You say perhaps Let me print some money I think the economy needs a stimulus The central bank governor will think you're crazy You might get impeached for that But if you become the president of Zimbabwe and you say You know I really like this job I think I'd like to stay in it forever Well you just can You decide you want to print money You call the central bank governor and you say Please double the money supply He'll say Okay yes sir is there anything else I can do for you This is the power that African leaders have and this is why they make the most difference on the continent The good news is that the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving We've had three generations of leaders in my mind Generation one are those who appeared in the '50s and '60s These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa They freed us from colonialism and let's give them credit for that They were followed by generation two These are people that brought nothing but havoc to Africa Think warfare corruption human rights abuses This is the stereotype of the typical African leader that we typically think of: Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire Sani Abacha from Nigeria The good news is that most of these leaders have moved on and they were replaced by generation three These are people like the late Nelson Mandela and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today like Paul Kagame and so forth Now these leaders are by no means perfect but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two They've stopped the fighting and I call them the stabilizer generation They're much more accountable to their people they've improved macroeconomic policies and we are seeing for the first time Africa's growing and in fact it's the second fastest growing economic region in the world So these leaders are by no means perfect but they are by and large the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years So where to from here I believe that the next generation to come after this generation four has a unique opportunity to transform the continent Specifically they can do two things that previous generations have not done The first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent Why is prosperity so important Because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty Africa today has the fastest growing population in the world but also is the poorest By 2030 Africa will have a larger workforce than China and by 2050 it will have the largest workforce in the world One billion people will need jobs in Africa so if we don't grow our economies fast enough we're sitting on a ticking time bomb not just for Africa but for the entire world Let me show you an example of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity: Laetitia Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school because her family couldn't afford to pay fees for her So she started her own business rearing rabbits which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya that she's from This business did so well that within a year she was employing 15 women and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school and through these women fund another 65 children to go to school The profits that she generated she used that to build a school and today she educates 400 children in her community And she's just turned 18 Another example is Erick Rajaonary Erick comes from the island of Madagascar Now Erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of Madagascar but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar Madagascar has these very special bats that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients In 2006 Erick quit his job as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings Today Erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue and he employs 70 people full time and another 800 people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most Now what I like about this story is that it shows that opportunities to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere Erick is known as the Batman And who would have thought that you would have been able to build a multimillion-dollar business employing so many people just from bat poo The second thing that this generation needs to do is to create our institutions They need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe Now all of this sounds great but where are we going to get this generation four from Do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance or that God gives them to us No I don't think so It's too important an issue for us to leave it to chance I believe that we need to create African institutions home-grown that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic practical way We've been doing this for the last 10 years through the African Leadership Academy Laetitia is one of our young leaders Today we have 700 of them that are being groomed for the African continent and over the next 50 years we expect to create 6，000 of them But one thing has been troubling me We would get about 4，000 applications a year for 100 young leaders that we could take into this academy and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we're offering But we couldn't satisfy it So today I'm announcing for the first time in public an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of African leaders Each campus will have 10，000 leaders at a time so we'll be educating and developing 250，000 leaders at any given time Over the next 50 years this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent My hope is that half of them will become the entrepreneurs that we need who will create these jobs that we need and the other half will go into government and the nonprofit sector and they will build the institutions that we need But they won't just learn academics They will also learn how to become leaders and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs So think of this as Africa's Ivy League but instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores or because of how much money you have or which family you come from the main criteria for getting into this university will be what is the potential that you have for transforming Africa But what we're doing is just one group of institutions We cannot transform Africa by ourselves My hope is that many many other home-grown African institutions will blossom and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of African leaders generation four and they will teach them this common message: create jobs build our institutions Nelson Mandela once said Every now and then a generation is called upon to be great You can be that great generation I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate the next generation of African leaders then this generation four that is coming up will be the greatest generation that Africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen Thank you It's great being here at TED You know I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet The little things in life sometimes that we forget about like pollination that we take for granted And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees bats hummingbirds butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day seven days a week for over 35 years To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of It fills me with wonder and it opens my heart Beauty and seduction I believe is nature's tool for survival because we will protect what we fall in love with Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it When I heard about the vanishing bees Colony Collapse Disorder it motivated me to take action We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind It's like the canary in the coalmine If they disappear so do we It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: What motivates the pollinators Well their answer was It's all about risk and reward Like a wide-eyed kid I'd say Why is that And they'd say Well because they want to survive I go Why Well in order to reproduce Well why And I thought that they'd probably say Well it's all about sex And Chip Taylor our monarch butterfly expert he replied Nothing lasts forever Everything in the universe wears out And that blew my mind Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life Rarely seen by the naked eye this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself over and over again So here is some nectar from my film I hope you'll drink tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden And always take time to smell the flowers and let it fill you with beauty and rediscover that sense of wonder Here are some images from the film Thank you Thank you very much Thank you I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity You're also talking about baseball Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity and we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity So for example you can be a pitcher or a catcher and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act Of course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm at least for the guy You can strike out which means you don't get to have any sexual activity And if you're a benchwarmer you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn't in the game maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset A bat's a penis and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a vagina A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom A switch-hitter is a bisexual person and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team And then there's this one: if there's grass on the field play ball And that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have pubic hair she's old enough to have sex with This baseball model is incredibly problematic It's sexist It's heterosexist It's competitive It's goal-directed And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults So we need a new model I'm here today to offer you that new model And it's based on pizza Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience So let's do this Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity: the trigger for sexual activity what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity So when do you play baseball You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule It's not exactly your choice So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home hey it's just batter up Can you imagine saying to your coach Uh I'm not really feeling it today I think I'll sit this game out That's just not the way it happens And when you get together to play baseball immediately you're with two opposing teams one playing offense one playing defense somebody's trying to move deeper into the field That's usually a sign to the boy Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field That's often given to the girl It's competitive We're not playing with each other We're playing against each other And when you show up to play baseball nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us Everybody knows the rules You just take your position and play the game But when do you have pizza Well you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza It starts with an internal sense an internal desire or a need Huh I could go for some pizza And because it's an internal desire we actually have some sense of control over that I could decide that I'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat And then when we get together with someone for pizza we're not competing with them we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us and when you get together for pizza with somebody what's the first thing you do You talk about it You talk about what you want You talk about what you like You may even negotiate it How do you feel about pepperoni Not so much I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself Well maybe we can go half and half And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time don't you still say things like Should we get the usual Or maybe something a little more adventurous Okay so when you're playing baseball so if we talk about during sexual activity when you're playing baseball you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time You can't hit the ball and run to right field That doesn't work And you also can't get to second base and say I like it here I'm going to stay here No And also of course with baseball there's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set Not everybody can play baseball It's pretty exclusive Okay but what about pizza When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza isn't it all about what's our pleasure There are a million different kinds of pizza There's a million different toppings There's a million different ways to eat pizza And none of them are wrong They're different And in this case difference is good because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience And lastly what's the expected outcome of baseball Well in baseball you play to win You score as many runs as you can There's always a winner in baseball and that means there's always a loser in baseball But what about pizza Well in pizza we're not really -- there's no winning How do you win pizza You don't But you do look for Are we satisfied And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days And we get to decide when we feel satisfied If we're still hungry we might have some more If you eat too much though you just feel gross So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people And those young people become older people But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires to make deliberate decisions about what they want to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying and we get to decide that You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison under the baseball it's all commands They're all exclamation points But under the pizza model they're questions And who gets to answer those questions You do I do So remember when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity baseball you're out Pizza is the way to think about healthy satisfying sexual activity and good comprehensive sexuality education Thank you very much for your time This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the Eastern Congo It's mined by armed gangs using slaves child slaves what the U。N Security Council calls blood minerals then traveled into some components and ended up in a factory in Shinjin in China That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year One man died after working a 36-hour shift We all love chocolate We buy it for our kids Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and it's harvested by children Cote d'Ivoire we have a huge problem of child slaves Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones to come and work on the coffee plantations Heparin -- a blood thinner a pharmaceutical product -- starts out in artisanal workshops like this in China because the active ingredient comes from pigs' intestines Your diamond -- you've all heard probably seen the movie Blood Diamond This is a mine in Zimbabwe right now Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest exporter of cotton on Earth Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest the government shuts down the schools puts the kids in buses buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton It's forced child labor on an institutional scale And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in Manila These places these origins represent governance gaps That's the politest description I have for them These are the dark pools where global supply chains begin -- the global supply chains which bring us our favorite brand name products Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states Some of them are not states anymore at all They're failed states Some of them are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation is the best way to attract investment promote trade Either way they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma I know that none of us want to be accessories after the fact of a human rights abuse in a global supply chain But right now most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product Now I didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain We need a reality check We need to recognize just how serious a deficit of rights we have This is an independent republic probably a failed state It's definitely not a democratic state And right now that independent republic of the supply chain is not being governed in a way that would satisfy us that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption Now that's not a new story You've seen the documentaries of sweatshops making garments all over the world even in developed countries You want to see the classic sweatshop meet me at Madison Square Garden I'll take you down the street and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop But take the example of heparin It's a pharmaceutical product You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital probably squeaky clean The problem is that the active ingredient in there -- as I mentioned earlier -- comes from pigs The main American manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to China because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs And their factory in China -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingredients from backyard abattoirs where families slaughter pigs and extract the ingredient So a couple of years ago we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain Worse some of the suppliers realized that they could substitute a product which mimicked heparin in tests This substitute cost nine dollars a pound whereas real heparin the real ingredient cost 900 dollars a pound A no-brainer The problem was that it killed more people And so you're asking yourself How come the U。S Food and Drug Administration allowed this to happen How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs allow this to happen And the answer is quite simple: the Chinese define these facilities as chemical facilities not pharmaceutical facilities so they don't audit them And the USFDA has a jurisdictional problem This is offshore They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year There are 500 of these facilities producing active ingredients in China alone In fact about 80 percent of the active ingredients in medicines now come from offshore particularly China and India and we don't have a governance system We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe We don't have a system to ensure that human rights basic dignity are ensured So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational So governments who are failing who are dropping the ball at a national level have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level And you can just look at the headlines Take Copenhagen last year -- complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago -- stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago You can take any one of the major global challenges we've discussed this week and ask yourself where is the leadership from governments to step up and come up with solutions responses to those international problems And the simple answer is they can't They're national Their voters are local They have parochial interests They can't subordinate those interests to the greater global public good So if we're going to ensure the delivery of the key public goods at an international level -- in this case in the global supply chain -- we have to come up with a different mechanism We need a different machine Fortunately we have some examples In the 1990s there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the U。S -- child labor forced labor serious health and safety abuses And eventually President Clinton in 1996 convened a meeting at the White House invited industry human rights NGOs trade unions the Department of Labor got them all in a room and said Look I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom I don't know how to prevent that but I'm at least going to use my good offices to get you folks together to come up with a response So they formed a White House task force and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility They don't own those facilities They don't employ those workers They're not legally liable Everybody else at the table said Folks that doesn't cut it You have a custodial duty a duty of care to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it without fear of our safety or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product So they agreed Okay what we'll do is we agree on a common set of standards code of conduct We'll apply that throughout our global supply chain regardless of ownership or control We'll make it part of the contract And that was a stroke of absolute genius because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract private power to deliver public goods And let's face it the contract from a major multinational brand to a supplier in India or China has much more persuasive value than the local labor law the local environmental regulations the local human rights standards Those factories will probably never see an inspector If the inspector did come along it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe Even if they did their jobs and they cited those facilities for their violations the fine would be derisory But you lose that contract for a major brand name that's the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt That makes a difference So what we've been able to do is we've been able to harness the power and the influence of the only truly transnational institution in the global supply chain that of the multinational company and get them to do the right thing get them to use that power for good to deliver the key public goods Now of course this doesn't come naturally to multinational companies They weren't set up to do this They're set up to make money But they are extremely efficient organizations They have resources and if we can add the will the commitment they know how to deliver that product Now getting there is not easy Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier they're not there You need a safe space You need a place where people can come together sit down without fear of judgment without recrimination to actually face the problem agree on the problem and come up with solutions We can do it The technical solutions are there The problem is the lack of trust the lack of confidence the lack of partnership between NGOs campaign groups civil society organizations and multinational companies If we can put those two together in a safe space get them to work together we can deliver public goods right now or in extremely short supply This is a radical proposition and it's crazy to think that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in Dhaka -- 22 23 24 dollars a month -- your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract It's crazy Multinationals are protecting human rights I know there's going to be disbelief You'll say How can we trust them Well we don't It's the old arms control phrase: Trust but verify So we audit We take their supply chain we take all the factory names we do a random sample we send inspectors on an unannounced basis to inspect those facilities and then we publish the results Transparency is absolutely critical to this You can call yourself responsible but responsibility without accountability often doesn't work So what we're doing is we're not only enlisting the multinationals we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we're checking You don't need to believe me You shouldn't believe me Go to the website Look at the audit results Ask yourself is this company behaving in a socially responsible way Can I buy that product without compromising my ethics That's the way the system works I hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world I hate the idea that governments have dropped this ball and I can't get used to the idea that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs I've been at this for 30 years and in that time I've seen the ability the commitment the will of government to do this decline and I don't see them making a comeback right now So we started out thinking this was a stopgap measure We're now thinking that in fact this is probably the start of a new way of regulating and addressing international challenges Call it network governance Call it what you will The private actors companies and NGOs are going to have to get together to face the major challenges we are going to face Just look at pandemics -- swine flu bird flu H1N1 Look at the health systems in so many countries Do they have the resources to face up to a serious pandemic No Could the private sector and NGOs get together and marshal a response Absolutely What they lack is that safe space to come together agree and move to action That's what we're trying to provide I know as well that this often seems like an overwhelming level of responsibility for people to assume You want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain There are thousands of suppliers in there It seems too daunting too dangerous for any company to take on But there are companies We have 4，000 companies who are members Some of them are very very large companies The sporting goods industry in particular stepped up to the plate and have done it The example the role model is there And whenever we discuss one of these problems that we have to address -- child labor in cottonseed farms in India -- this year we will monitor 50，000 cottonseed farms in India It seems overwhelming The numbers just make you want to zone out But we break it down to some basic realities And human rights comes down to a very simple proposition: can I give this person their dignity back Poor people people whose human rights have been violated -- the crux of that is the loss of dignity the lack of dignity It starts with just giving people back their dignity I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon just next to Delhi one of the flashiest brightest new cities popping up in India right now and I was talking to workers who worked in garment sweatshops down the road and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands They didn't say money They said The people who employ us treat us like we are less than human like we don't exist Please ask them to treat us like human beings That's my simple understanding of human rights That's my simple proposition to you my simple plea to every decision-maker in this room everybody out there We can all make a decision to come together and pick up the balls and run with the balls that governments have dropped If we don't do it we're abandoning hope we're abandoning our essential humanity and I know that's not a place we want to be and we don't have to be there So I appeal to you Join us come into that safe space and let's start to make this happen Thank you very much This is me My name is Ben Saunders I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places On May 11th last year I stood alone at the North geographic Pole I was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of America five-and-a-half thousand square miles More than 2，000 people have climbed Everest 12 people have stood on the moon Including me only four people have skied solo to the North Pole And I think the reason for that -- -- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's -- well it's as Chris said bonkers It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back 800 miles in 10 weeks And I was dragging all the food I needed the supplies the equipment sleeping bag one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months What we're going to try and do today in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left is to try and answer three questions The first one is why The second one is how do you go to the loo at minus 40 Ben I've read somewhere that at minus 40 exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute so how do you answer the call of nature I don't want to answer these now I'll come on to them at the end Third one: how do you top that What's next It all started back in 2001 My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap This was like my polar apprenticeship We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here Severnaya Zemlya to the North Pole And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole geographic North Pole is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea This is about as good as maps get and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean I'd spoken to all the experts I'd read lots of books I studied maps and charts But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for I was 23 years old No one my age had attempted anything like this and pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong We were attacked by a polar bear on day two I had frostbite in my left big toe We started running very low on food We were both pretty hungry losing lots of weight Some very unusual weather conditions very difficult ice conditions We had decidedly low-tech communications We couldn't afford a satellite phone so we had HF radio You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent There's a wire dangling down either side That was our HF radio antenna We had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months Ultimately we ran out of time We'd skied 400 miles We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole and we'd run out of time We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio and they said Look boys you've run out of time We've got to pick you up And I felt that I had failed wholeheartedly I was a failure The one goal the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close And skiing along that first trip I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough just to keep my motivation going The first one was reaching the Pole itself I could see vividly I suppose being filmed out of the door of a helicopter there was kind of rock music playing in the background and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack you know flying in the wind I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole you know -- ah glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport and I could see again vividly the camera flashbulbs going off the paparazzi the autograph hunters the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal And of course neither of these things happened We didn't get to the Pole and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR so no one had heard of this expedition And I got back to Heathrow My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack -- -- and that was about it I went back to live with my mum I was physically exhausted mentally an absolute wreck considered myself a failure In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition and lying on my mum's sofa day in day out watching daytime TV My brother sent me a text message an SMS -- it was a quote from the Simpsons It said You tried your hardest and failed miserably The lesson is: don't even try Fast forward three years I did eventually get off the sofa and start planning another expedition This time I wanted to go right across on my own this time from Russia at the top of the map to the North Pole where the sort of kink in the middle is and then on to Canada No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000 No one's done it solo Very famous very accomplished Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner tried it in 1995 and he was rescued after a week He described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as Everest So for some reason this was what I wanted to have a crack at but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece let alone make it across to Canada I had to take a radical approach This meant everything from perfecting the sawn-off sub-two-gram toothbrush to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch: 6，000 calories a day And the expedition started in February last year Big support team We had a film crew a couple of logistics people with us my girlfriend a photographer At first it was pretty sensible We flew British Airways to Moscow The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir spelled K-R-A-S The next bit we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga which was the sort of last bit of civilization Our cameraman who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times actually asked the pilot before we got on the plane how long this flight would take and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan replied Six hours -- if we live We got to Khatanga I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world but you can see it from there It was supposed to be an overnight stay We were stuck there for 10 days There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter so we were stuck We couldn't move Finally morning of day 11 we got the all-clear loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming photography; while the helicopter was still there I did an interview on the satellite phone; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter wham the door closed and I was alone And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice All I could think about was running back up to the door banging on the door and saying Look guys I haven't quite thought this through To make things worse you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon Because we'd been held up in Russia of course the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides; when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit I was you can see there pulling two sledges Grand total in all 95 days of food and fuel 180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds When the ice was flat or flattish I could just about pull both When the ice wasn't flat I didn't have a hope in hell I had to pull one leave it and go back and get the other one Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean the wind and the tides NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began And it's always drifting The pack ice is always drifting I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year and I was drifting backwards most of the time My record was minus 2。5 miles I got up in the morning took the tent down skied north for seven-and-a-half hours put the tent up and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice So it's day 22 I'm lying in the tent getting ready to go The weather is just appalling -- oh drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night Later in the expedition the problem was no longer the ice It was a lack of ice -- open water I knew this was happening I knew the Artic was warming I knew there was more open water And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve This was my little bit of bio-mimicry Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines If they come to water they'll climb in swim across it So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into It would go on over my boots over my mittens it would pull up around my face and seal pretty tightly around my face And this meant I could ski over very thin ice and if I fell through it wasn't the end of the world It also meant if the worst came to the worst I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me Some pretty radical technology a radical approach --but it worked perfectly Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology In 1912 Shackleton's Endurance expedition -- there was -- one of his crew a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees He said The explorers of 2012 if there is anything left to explore will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes Well Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years This is my pocket wireless telephone Iridium satellite phone The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice I was blogging live from my tent sending back a little diary piece sending back information on the distance I'd covered -- the ice conditions the temperature -- and a daily photo Remember 2001 we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world Last year blogging live from an expedition that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest It wasn't all high-tech This is navigating in what's called a whiteout When you get lots of mist low cloud the wind starts blowing the snow up You can't see an awful lot You can just see there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles I'd navigate using the direction of the wind So kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech I got to the Pole on the 11th of May It took me 68 days to get there from Russia and there is nothing there There isn't even a pole at the Pole There's nothing there purely because it's sea ice It's drifting Stick a flag there leave it there pretty soon it will drift off usually towards Canada or Greenland I knew this but I was expecting something Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage a lot of open water around and of course elated that I'd got there under my own steam but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada which was still 400 miles away were slim at best The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS the little satellite navigation gadget You can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole I took a photo of that Sat down on my sledge Did a sort of video diary piece Took a few photos I got my satellite phone out I warmed the battery up in my armpit I dialed three numbers I dialed my mum I dialed my girlfriend I dialed the CEO of my sponsor And I got three voicemails Ninety It's a special feeling The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet The -- the whole world underneath me I finally got through to my mum She was at the queue of the supermarket She started crying She asked me to call her back I skied on for a week past the Pole I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue This was the last day I had on the ice When I spoke to the -- my project management team they said Look Ben conditions are getting too dangerous There are huge areas of open water just south of your position We'd like to pick you up Ben could you please look for an airstrip This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call I'd never tried to build an airstrip before Tony the expedition manager he said Look Ben you've got to find 500 meters of flat thick safe ice The only bit of ice I could find -- it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -- was exactly 473 meters I could measure it with my skis I didn't tell Tony that I didn't tell the pilots that I thought it'll have to do Oh oh oh oh oh oh It just about worked A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all The pilot I knew was called Troy I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment So I thought I've got to compose myself for Troy I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type The plane taxied up to where I was standing The door opened This guy jumped out He's about that tall He said Hi my name is Troy The co-pilot was a lady called Monica She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper They were the least macho people I've ever met but they made my day Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice; we took a few photos He climbed up the ladder He said Just -- just get in the back He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and I climbed in the back Taxied up and down the runway a few times just to flatten it out a bit and he said Right I'm going to -- I'm going to give it a go And he -- I've now learned that this is standard practice but it had me worried at the time He put his hand on the throttle You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit It's that little bar there He put his hand on the throttle Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his I thought God here we go We're we're -- this is all or nothing Rammed it forwards Bounced down the runway Just took off One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway banking I could see into the cockpit Troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the wall And only from the air did I see the big picture Of course when you're on the ice you only ever see one obstacle at a time whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip I mean it really was starting to break up Why I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense I'm not skiing along drawing maps; everyone knows where the North Pole is At the South Pole there's a big scientific base There's an airstrip There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop For me this is about exploring human limits about exploring the limits of physiology of psychology and of technology They're the things that excite me And it's also about potential on a personal level This for me is a chance to explore the limits -- really push the limits of my own potential see how far they stretch And on a wider scale it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of So on a wider scale I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet That's as close as I can come to summing that up The next question is how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 The answer of course to which is a trade secret -- and the last question what's next As quickly as possible if I have a minute left at the end I'll go into more detail What's next: Antarctica It's the coldest highest windiest and driest continent on Earth Late 1911 early 1912 there was a race to be the first to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent If you include the coastal ice shelves you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf -- it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France Antarctica if you include the ice shelves is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and Scott the British guy Captain Scott Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs all of which went wrong and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot They got to the Pole late January 1912 to find a Norwegian flag already there There was a tent a letter to the Norwegian king And they turned around headed back to the coast and all five of them died on the return journey Since then no one has ever skied -- this was 93 years ago -- since then no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey So that's the plan Two of us are doing it That's pretty much it One final thought before I get to the toilet bit is -- is I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten -- but I have a -- I have a school report I was 13 years old and it's framed above my desk at home It says Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile I think if I've learned anything it's this: that no one else is the authority on your potential You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of Ladies and gentlemen that's my story Thank you very much Thank you Two years ago I stood on the TED stage in Arusha Tanzania I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations It was a simple machine that changed my life Before that time I had never been away from my home in Malawi I had never used a computer I had never seen an Internet On the stage that day I was so nervous My English lost I wanted to vomit I had never been surrounded by so many azungu white people There was a story I wouldn't tell you then But well I'm feeling good right now I would like to share that story today We have seven children in my family All sisters excepting me This is me with my dad when I was a little boy Before I discovered the wonders of science I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers Like everyone else we grew maize One year our fortune turned very bad In 2001 we experienced an awful famine Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death My family ate one meal per day at night Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us The food passes through our bodies We drop down to nothing In Malawi the secondary school you have to pay school fees Because of the hunger I was forced to drop out of school I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields It was the future I couldn't accept I felt very happy to be at the secondary school so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education So I went to a library I read books science books especially physics I couldn't read English that well I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them Another book put that knowledge in my hands It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity Pump water meant irrigation a defense against hunger which we were experiencing by that time So I decided I would build one windmill for myself But I didn't have materials to use so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials Many people including my mother said I was crazy I found a tractor fan shock absorber PVC pipes Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo I built my machine It was one light at first And then four lights with switches and even a circuit breaker modeled after an electric bell Another machine pumps water for irrigation Queues of people start lining up at my house to charge their mobile phone I could not get rid of them And the reporters came too which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED I had never seen an airplane before I had never slept in a hotel So on stage that day in Arusha my English lost I said something like I tried And I made it So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans and the poor who are struggling with your dreams God bless Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet I say to you trust yourself and believe Whatever happens don't give up Thank you So since I was here last in '06 we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue so we covered that fairly extensively in Skeptic magazine We investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this because the world's going to end in 2012 Another update: You will recall I introduced you guys to the Quadro Tracker It's like a water dowsing device It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around And you walk around and it points to things Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers it'll point right to somebody Oh sorry This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes Well under the category of What's the harm of silly stuff like this this device the ADE 651 was sold to the Iraqi government for 40，000 dollars apiece It's just like this one completely worthless in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good but it does absolutely nothing In this case at trespass points allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay actually cost lives So there is a danger to pseudoscience in believing in this sort of thing So what I want to talk about today is belief I want to believe and you do too And in fact I think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things It is the default option We just believe We believe all sorts of things Belief is natural; disbelief skepticism science is not natural It's more difficult It's uncomfortable to not believe things So like Fox Mulder on X-Files who wants to believe in UFOs Well we all do and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains Essentially we are pattern-seeking primates We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C And sometimes A really is connected to B and that's called association learning We find patterns we make those connections whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food and then he salivates to the sound of the bell or whether it's a Skinnerian rat in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior In fact what Skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there -- if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice And that's called superstition and that I'm afraid we will always have with us I call this process patternicity -- that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise When we do this process we make two types of errors A Type I error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it's not Our second type of error is a false negative A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is So let's do a thought experiment You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of Africa Your name is Lucy okay And you hear a rustle in the grass Is it a dangerous predator or is it just the wind Your next decision could be the most important one of your life Well if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind you've made an error in cognition made a Type I error false positive But no harm You just move away You're more cautious You're more vigilant On the other hand if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator you're lunch You've just won a Darwin award You've been taken out of the gene pool Now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a Type I error is less than the cost of making a Type II error This is the only equation in the talk by the way We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic especially in split-second life-and-death situations So the default position is just: Believe all patterns are real -- All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind And so I think that we evolved 。。 there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines our pattern-seeking brain processes to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to So for example what do you see here It's a horse head that's right It looks like a horse It must be a horse That's a pattern And is it really a horse Or is it more like a frog See our pattern detection device which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex -- it's our little detection device there -- can be easily fooled and this is the problem For example what do you see here Yes of course it's a cow Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming -- once I prime the brain to see it it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it And what do you see here Some people see a Dalmatian dog Yes there it is And there's the prime So when I go back without the prime your brain already has the model so you can see it again What do you see here Planet Saturn Yes that's good How about here Just shout out anything you see That's a good audience Chris Because there's nothing in this Well allegedly there's nothing This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson at U。T Austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns That is almost everybody sees the planet Saturn People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this which is allegedly patternless In other words the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there's a lack of control For example baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they're batting but not so much when they're fielding Because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time The best batters fail seven out of 10 times So their superstitions their patternicities are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth What do you see in this particular one here in this field Anybody see an object there There actually is something here but it's degraded While you're thinking about that this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore a psychologist in England who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an ESP test: How much did they believe in the paranormal supernatural angels and so forth And those who scored high on the ESP scale tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns Here is what you show subjects The fish is degraded 20 percent 50 percent and then the one I showed you 70 percent A similar experiment was done by another Swiss psychologist named Peter Brugger who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere via the left visual field than the left hemisphere So if you present subjects the images such that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left then they're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere Our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens Brugger and his colleague Christine Mohr gave subjects L-DOPA L-DOPA's a drug as you know given for treating Parkinson's disease which is related to a decrease in dopamine L-DOPA increases dopamine An increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine So dopamine appears to be the drug associated with patternicity In fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and hallucinations these are patternicities They're incorrect patterns They're false positives They're Type I errors And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists they go away That is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases On the other hand amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists They increase the amount of dopamine So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state creativity find more patterns In fact I saw Robin Williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than now So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity Dopamine I think changes our signal-to-noise ratio That is how accurate we are in finding patterns If it's too low you're more likely to make too many Type II errors You miss the real patterns You don't want to be too skeptical If you're too skeptical you'll miss the really interesting good ideas Just right you're creative and yet you don't fall for too much baloney Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere Every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you You think people are talking about you And if you go too far on that that's just simply labeled as madness It's a distinction perhaps we might make between two Nobel laureates Richard Feynman and John Nash One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize The other one also but maybe too many patterns And we then call that schizophrenia So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem And of course you all know exactly what this is right And what pattern do you see here Again I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here causing you conflicting pattern detections You know of course this is Via Uno shoes These are sandals Pretty sexy feet I must say Maybe a little Photoshopped And of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop back and forth It turns out what you're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see And you see the lamp here I know Because the lights on here Of course thanks to the environmentalist movement we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is of course the dolphins right You see a dolphin here and there's a dolphin and there's a dolphin That's a dolphin tail there guys If we can give you conflicting data again your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive If you look down here it's fine If you look up here then you get conflicting data And then we have to flip the image for you to see that it's a set up The impossible crate illusion It's easy to fool the brain in 2D So you say Aw come on Shermer anybody can do that in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that Well here's the late great Jerry Andrus' impossible crate illusion in 3D in which Jerry is standing inside the impossible crate And he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal Of course camera angle is everything The photographer is over there and this board appears to overlap with this one and this one with that one and so on But even when I take it away the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns This is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle In fact it's the exact same picture side by side So what you're doing is comparing that angle instead of with this one but with that one And so your brain is fooled Yet again your pattern detection devices are fooled Faces are easy to see because we have an additional evolved facial recognition software in our temporal lobes Here's some faces on the side of a rock I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped But anyway the point is still made Now which one of these looks odd to you In a quick reaction which one looks odd The one on the left Okay So I'll rotate it so it'll be the one on the right And you are correct A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher Now they trade up the politicians every time Well why is this happening Well we know exactly where it happens in the temporal lobe right across sort of above your ear there in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus And there's two types of cells that do this that record facial features either globally or specifically these large rapid-firing cells first look at the general face So you recognize Obama immediately And then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth Especially when they're upside down you're engaging that general facial recognition software there Now I said back in our little thought experiment you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator What's the difference between those Well the wind is inanimate; the dangerous predator is an intentional agent And I call this process agenticity That is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning intention and agency often invisible beings from the top down This is an idea that we got from a fellow TEDster here Dan Dennett who talked about taking the intentional stance So it's a type of that expanded to explain I think a lot of different things: souls spirits ghosts gods demons angels aliens intelligent designers government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention are believed to haunt our world and control our lives I think it's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism It's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us more moral than us and the narratives always are that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high The intelligent designer's always portrayed as this super intelligent moral being that comes down to design life Even the idea that government can rescue us -- that's no longer the wave of the future but that is I think a type of agenticity: projecting somebody up there big and powerful will come rescue us And this is also I think the basis of conspiracy theories There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings whether it's the Illuminati or the Bilderbergers But this is a pattern detection problem isn't it Some patterns are real and some are not Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin Well if you go there -- there's people there on any given day -- like when I went there here -- showing me where the different shooters were My favorite one was he was in the manhole And he popped out at the last second took that shot But of course Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy So we can't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that Because let's face it some patterns are real Some conspiracies really are true Explains a lot maybe And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory It is a conspiracy We did a whole issue on it Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy But that's not what the 9/11 truthers think They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration Well that's a whole other lecture You know how we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the Bush administration Because it worked So we are natural-born dualists Our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these Because we can imagine in essence continuing on We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences near-death experiences which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there Or you can do it through loss of consciousness by accelerating in a centrifuge You get a hypoxia or a lower oxygen And the brain then senses that there's an out-of-body experience You can use -- which I did went out and did -- Michael Persinger's God Helmet that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves And you get a sense of out-of-body experience So I'm going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together It's just a minute and a half It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief Go ahead and roll it This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm We're hoping we can use part of this in a national commercial right And this is test on some lip balms that we have over here And these are our models who are going to help us Roger and Matt And we have our own lip balm and we have a leading brand Would you have any problem kissing our models to test it Girl: No You wouldn't You'd think that was fine Girl: That would be fine So this is a blind test I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on Kay now can you see anything Pull it so you can't even see down It's completely blind now right Girl: Yes Now what I'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips the texture right and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not Girl: Okay Girl: No Take a step here Okay now I'm going to ask you to pucker up Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit okay Okay And Jennifer how did that feel Jennifer: Good Girl: Oh my God Michael Shermer: Thank you very much Thank you Thanks Most of the time art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension There is great confusion when the two look at each other Art of course looks at the world through the psyche the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic Science tends to look at the world through the rational the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a terrific context of understanding In the Extreme Ice Survey we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better Specifically I as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life am firmly of the belief that photography video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature In this project we're specifically interested of course in ice I'm fascinated by the beauty of it the mutability of it the malleability of it and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself These first images are from Greenland But ice has another meaning Ice is the canary in the global coal mine It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of is it raining more or is it raining less Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder What do the computer models say about this that and the other thing All of that strip it away In the world of the arctic and alpine environments where the ice is it's real and it's present The changes are happening They're very visible They're photographable They're measurable 95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking That's outside Antarctica 95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing There is no significant scientific dispute about that It's been observed it's measured it's bomb-proof information And the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that Science is not arguing about that In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old breaking up into chunks and chunk by chunk by chunk iceberg by iceberg turning into global sea level rise So having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were as recorded in the ice sheets as recorded in deep ocean sediments as recorded in lake sediments tree rings and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature When I realized that climate change was real and it was not based on computer models I decided that one day I would do a project looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically And that led me to this project Initially I was working on a National Geographic assignment -- conventional single frame still photography And one crazy day I got the idea that I should -- after that assignment was finished -- I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography that I should station a camera or two at a glacier and let it shoot every 15 minutes or every hour or whatever and watch the progression of the landscape over time Well within about three weeks I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras into 25 time-lapse cameras And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career trying to design build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras They are powered by the sun Solar panels power them Power goes into a battery There is a custom made computer that tells the camera when to fire And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers and they look in on the glacier from permanent bedrock positions and they watch the evolution of the landscape We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet We actually drilled holes into the ice way deep down below the thawing level and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so Actually there's still a camera out there right now In any case the cameras shoot roughly every hour Some of them shoot every half hour every 15 minutes every five minutes Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made I personally obsessed about every nut bolt and washer in these crazy things I spent half my life at our local hardware store during the months when we built these units originally We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere Our time-lapse units are in Alaska the Rockies Greenland and Iceland and we have repeat photography positions that is places we just visit on an annual basis in British Columbia the Alps and Bolivia It's a big undertaking I stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team There's a lot of people working on this right now We've got 33 cameras out this moment We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere watching what's happened And we've spent a lot of time in the field It's been a fantastic amount of work We've been out for two and a half years and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go That's only half our job The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public You know scientists have collected this kind of information off and on over the years but a lot of it stays within the science community Similarly a lot of art projects stay in the art community and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED and like our relationship with the Obama White House with the Senate with John Kerry to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well We've done films We've done books We have more coming We have a site on Google Earth that Google Earth was generous enough to give us and so forth because we feel very much the need to tell this story because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now Now one bit of science before we get into the visuals If everybody in the developed world understood this graph and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion Key issues: this is a 400，000 year record This exact same pattern is seen going back now almost a million years before our current time And several things are important Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere go up and down basically in sync You can see that from the orange line and the blue line Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million That's the natural cycle Goes up to 280 and then drops for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here But 280 is the peak Right now if you look at the top right part of that graph we're at 385 parts per million We are way way outside the normal natural variability Earth is having a fever In the past hundred years the temperature of the Earth has gone up 1。3 degrees Fahrenheit 。75 degrees Celsius and it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year It's been a remorseless steady increase We have to turn that around That's the crux and someday I hope to emblazon that across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places But anyway off to the world of ice We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska This is a view of what's called the calving face This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months You see the glacier flowing in from the right dropping off into the sea camera shooting every hour If you look in the middle background you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable and you're about to see the consequences of that floating To give you a little bit of a sense of scale that calving face in this picture is about 325 feet tall That's 32 stories This is not a little cliff This is like a major office building in an urban center The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off but in fact it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock and floating if it isn't Here's what Columbia's done This is in south central Alaska This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago This is an aerial picture we did this year That's the retreat of this glacier The main stem the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right and it's going very rapidly up that stem We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back I wouldn't be the least bit surprised Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places because as the glaciers -- one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge they're not normal landscapes -- but as the glaciers are retreating they're also deflating like air is being let out of a balloon And so there are features on this landscape There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture up above where that arrow comes in that shows you that a little bit There's a marker line called the trim line above our little red illustration there This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot right -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points But in any case the deflation of this glacier since 1984 has been higher than the Eiffel Tower higher than the Empire State Building A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys as it's retreated and deflated gone back up valley These changes in the alpine world are accelerating It's not static Particularly in the world of sea ice the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago and the processes either are accelerating or the predictions were too low to begin with But in any case there are big big changes happening as we speak So here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia And you see where it ended in these various spring days June May then October Now we turn on our time lapse This camera was shooting every hour Geologic process in action here And everybody says well don't they advance in the winter time No It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier Finally catches up to itself it advances And you can look at these pictures over and over again because there's such a strange bizarre fascination in seeing these things you don't normally get to see come alive We've been talking about seeing is believing and seeing the unseen at TED Global That's what you see with these cameras The images make the invisible visible These huge crevasses open up These great ice islands break off -- and now watch this This has been the springtime this year -- a huge collapse That happened in about a month the loss of all that ice So that's where we started three years ago way out on the left and that's where we were a few months ago the last time we went into Columbia To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat we did another cheesy illustration with British double-decker buses If you line up 295 of those nose to tail that's about how far back that was It's a long way On up to Iceland One of my favorite glaciers the Sólheimajökull And here if you watch you can see the terminus retreating You can see this river being formed You can see it deflating Without the photographic process you would never see this This is invisible You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this but the camera records it So we wind time backwards now We go back a couple years in time That's where it started That's where it ended a few months ago And on up to Greenland The smaller the ice mass the faster it responds to climate Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there It's a big place That's all ice All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle The one glacier up in Greenland that puts more ice into the global ocean than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined is the Ilulissat Glacier We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat Here's a two-year record of what that looks like Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale quickly dwarfed The calving face is four and a half miles across and in this shot as we pull back you're only seeing about a mile and a half So imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out The interior of Greenland is to the right It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left Icebergs many many many many times the size of this building are roaring out to sea We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago as you can see June 25th monster calving events happened I'll show you one of those in a second This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years It now goes at 125 feet a day dumping all this ice into the ocean It tends to go in these pulses about every three days but on average 125 feet a day twice the rate it did 20 years ago Okay We had a team out watching this glacier and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film We had nine cameras going This is what a couple of the cameras saw A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off Huge icebergs rolling over Okay how big was that It's hard to get it So an illustration again gives you a feeling for scale A mile of retreat in 75 minutes across the calving face in that particular event three miles wide The block was three-fifths of a mile deep and if you compare the expanse of the calving face to the Tower Bridge in London about 20 bridges wide Or if you take an American reference to the U。S Capitol Building and you pack 3，000 Capitol Buildings into that block it would be equivalent to how large that block was 75 minutes Now I've come to the conclusion after spending a lot of time in this climate change world that we don't have a problem of economics technology and public policy We have a problem of perception The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues but we actually can deal with them I'm certain that we can But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet You're an elite audience You get it Fortunately a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us And that's where I think organizations like TED like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along Because I believe we have an opportunity right now We are nearly on the edge of a crisis but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge of our generation and in fact of our century This is a terrific terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done Thank you When most people think about the beginnings of AIDS they're gonna think back to the 1980s And certainly this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS and the virus that causes it HIV But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before from chimpanzees where the virus originated into humans who hunt these apes This photo was taken before the Great Depression in Brazzaville Congo At this time there were thousands of individuals we think that were infected with HIV So I have a couple of really important questions for you If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus OK now more importantly had we been there in the '40s and '50s '60s had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved In fact this is not unique to HIV The vast majority of viruses come from animals And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human Nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of HIV So during the last 15 years I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what I've labeled viral chatter which was a term coined by my mentor Don Burke This is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations the movement of these agents over into humans; and by capturing this moment we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early OK so this is a picture and I'm going to show you some pictures now from the field This is a picture of a central African hunter It's actually a fairly common picture One of the things I want you to note from it is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact This was absolutely key for us This is a very intimate form of connection So if we're going to study viral chatter we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals And so we've been studying people like this individual We collect blood from them other specimens We look at the diseases which are in the animals as well as the humans And ideally this is going to allow us to catch these things early on as they're moving over into human populations And the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis When they were sick we would collect specimens from them We would actually enlist them -- which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals We give them these little pieces of filter paper When they sample from animals they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted Deep in a remote region of Cameroon two hunters stalk their prey Their names are Patrice and Patee They're searching for bush meat; forest animals they can kill to feed their families Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes They have a series of traps of snares that they've set up to catch wild pigs snakes monkeys rodents -- anything they can really Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing The animals are simply gone We stop for a drink of water Then there is a rustle in the brush A group of hunters approach their packs loaded with wild game There's at least three viruses that you know about which are in this particular monkey Nathan Wolfe: This species yeah And there's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals These individuals are at specific risk particularly if there's blood contact they're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses As the hunters display their kills something surprising happens They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses part of a program Dr Wolfe has spent years setting up NW: So this is from this animal right here Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least at a minimum been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities which presumably from our perspective gives them the ability to decrease their own risk and then obviously the risk to their families the village the country and the world NW: OK before I continue I think it's important to take just a moment to talk about bush meat Bush meat is the hunting of wild game OK And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat I'm going to be talking about this When your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time one of the things they're gonna ask you is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives some of the most valuable and endangered species on our planet to go extinct because we weren't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this They're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered into the human population and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this why did we let these behaviors continue Why did we not find some other solution to this They're going to say in regions of profound instability throughout the world where you have intense poverty where populations are growing and you don't have sustainable resources like this this is going to lead to food insecurity But they're also going to ask you probably a different question It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves which is why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder -- this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that I showed you OK take a look at his shirt You know take a look at his face Bush meat is one of the central crises which is occurring in our population right now in humanity on this planet But it can't be the fault of somebody like this OK And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone There's no easy solutions but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril So in 1998 along with my mentors Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole we went to actually start this work in Central Africa to work with hunters in this part of the world And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow and I was really tasked with setting this up So I said to myself OK great -- we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens We're gonna go to all these different locations It's going to be wonderful You know I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites; I figured no problem Needless to say I was drastically wrong This is challenging work to do Fortunately I had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team and that's the only way that this work can really occur We have a whole range of challenges about this work One of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying Paul worked for years on the Cameroonian national radio and television and he spoke about health issues He was a health correspondent So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could be a great communicator When we would get to these rural villages though what we found out is that no one had television so they wouldn't recognize his face But -- when he began to speak they would actually recognize his voice from the radio And this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention Often we run into obstacles This is us coming back from one of these very rural sites with specimens from 200 individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours I like to show this shot -- this is Ubald Tamoufe who's the lead investigator in our Cameroon site Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo because of course you can't see his face But the reason I like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem Which -- which he did which he did Just a few quick before and after shots This was our laboratory before This is what it looks like now Early on in order to ship our specimens we had to have dry ice To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg borrow steal to get these folks to give it to us Now we have our own liquid nitrogen I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be And here's a shot of me this is the before shot of me No comment So what happened So during the 10 years that we've been doing this work we actually surprised ourselves We made a number of discoveries And what we've found is that if you look in the right place you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations That gave us a tremendous amount of hope What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals including new viruses in the same group as HIV -- so brand new retroviruses And let's face it any new retrovirus in the human population -- it's something we should be aware of It's something we should be following It's not something that we should be surprised by Needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct That's no longer the case Logging roads provide access to urban areas And critically what happens in central Africa doesn't stay in Central Africa So once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring we decided to move this from research to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort Through generous support and partnership scientifically with Google。org and the Skoll Foundation we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative and begin work in four different sites in Africa and Asia Needless to say different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact So it's not just hunters in Central Africa It's also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where SARS emerged in Asia But really this is just the beginning from our perspective Our objective right now in addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots -- because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things ideally before they make it to blood banks sexual networks airplanes And that's really our objective There was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves and thought about ourselves Many people I think on our planet right now despair and they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair If an intelligent extra-terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet 27 out of 30 of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus with just a few of the volumes left for plants fungus and animals humans being a footnote; interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet The dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about And yet finally we have the tools which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them Thank you very much Good morning I think as a grumpy Eastern European I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning So bear with me Well I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus which as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy So that's why I've always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours So I'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic I decided to join the NGO which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former Soviet Union However to my surprise I discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily In fact some of them actually survived the Internet challenge and some got even more repressive So this is when I ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my NGO job and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization Now I must tell you that this was never a very popular argument and it's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience It was never popular with many political leaders especially those in the United States who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't That is promote democracy in difficult places where everything else has already been tried and failed And I think by 2009 this news has finally reached Britain so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well However there is an underlying argument about logistics which has driven so much of this debate Right So if you look at it close enough you'll actually see that much of this is about economics The cybertopians say much like fax machines and Xerox machines did in the '80s blogs and social networks have radically transformed the economics of protest so people would inevitably rebel To put it very simply the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity if you give them enough devices democracy will inevitably follow And to tell you the truth I never really bought into this argument in part because I never saw three American presidents agree on anything else in the past But you know even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something I call iPod liberalism where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese who happens to have and love his iPod will also love liberal democracy And again I think this is kind of false But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping iPods not bombs -- I mean it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book But this is rarely a good sign Right So the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology For those of you who think that new media of the Internet could somehow help us avert genocide should look no further than Rwanda where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place But even beyond that coming back to the Internet what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes Right And they are building what I call the Spinternet The combination of spin on the one hand and the Internet on the other So governments from Russia to China to Iran are actually hiring training and paying bloggers in order to leave ideological comments and create a lot of ideological blog posts to comment on sensitive political issues Right So you may wonder why on Earth are they doing it Why are they engaging with cyberspace Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places The moment you put something critical in a blog even if you manage to ban it immediately it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs So the more you block it the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game So the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a CIA agent And again this is happening quite often Just to give you an example of how it works in China for example There was a big case in February 2009 called Elude the Cat And for those of you who didn't know I'll just give a little summary So what happened is that a 24-year-old man a Chinese man died in prison custody And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek which is elude the cat in Chinese slang with other inmates and hit his head against the wall which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments In fact QQ。com which is a popular Chinese website had 35，000 comments on this issue within hours But then authorities did something very smart Instead of trying to purge these comments they instead went and reached out to the bloggers And they basically said Look guys We'd like you to become netizen investigators So 500 people applied and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question and thus inspect it and then blog about it Within days the entire incident was forgotten which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content People would keep talking about it for weeks And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online We tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them And you may wonder why I'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators And first it's quite simple Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum They don't really have the data they need in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime So encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because otherwise low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country right So from this perspective having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great Secondly involving public in any decision making is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail Because they say Well look we asked you we consulted you you voted on it You put it on the front page of your blog Well great You are the one who is to blame And finally the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes both at home and abroad So inviting people to all sorts of public forums having them participate in decision making it's actually great Because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say Well we are having a democracy We are having a forum Just to give you an example one of the Russian regions for example now involves its citizens in planning its strategy up until year 2020 Right So they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020 I mean anyone who has been to Russia would know that there was no planning in Russia for the next month So having people involved in planning for 2020 is not necessarily going to change anything because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda Just to give you an example from Iran we all heard about the Twitter revolution that happened there but if you look close enough you'll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational They may have become slower but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence In the past it would take you weeks if not months to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other Now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their Facebook page I mean KGB and not just KGB used to torture in order to actually get this data Now it's all available online But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives people who have grown up online We often hear about cyber activism how people are getting more active because of the Internet Rarely hear about cyber hedonism for example how people are becoming passive Why Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography That's not an option being considered too strongly So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft And this is realistic And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet you'll see that the number of teenagers in China for example for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life is three times more than in the United States So it does play a social role however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement So the way I tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow But the point here is that when we get the remote Russian village online what will get people to the Internet is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch It's going to be pornography Sex and the City or maybe watching funny videos of cats So this is something you have to recognize So what should we do about it Well I say we have to stop thinking about the number of iPods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals dissidents NGOs and then the members of civil society Because even what has been happening up 'til now with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions and actually start doing something about it There's an old saying Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there My work is -- it's a reflection of myself What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things We all seem to think that you know if we look down on the ground there's nothing there And we use the word nothing Nothing doesn't exist because there is always something My mother told me that when I was a child that I should always respect the little things What made me do this work I shall go into my story This all started when I was age five What made me do it At school I will admit this: academically I couldn't express myself So I was more or less classed as nothing My world was seen as less So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world I thought I need to retreat into something else So when my mother used to take me to school she thought I was at school and I used to do a U-turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden Now the one time I was in the shed and my mother suspected something thinking I was at school My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry So you'd just see her feet So I was hiding in the shed like that And all of a sudden 。。 And then I saw her legs And then she said -- grabbed me like that because my mother was quite big -- and she lifted me up and she says How come you're not at school I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me ridiculing me and using me as an example of failure So I told her At that age obviously I couldn't express it that way but I told her I didn't feel right And then she just said You're going back to school tomorrow And walked off And I didn't expect that because I expected one of these 。。 But I didn't get it So I'm sitting there thinking And as I looked down on the ground I noticed there was some ants running around And I went into this little fantasy world And I thought These ants are they looking for the queen ant Or do they need somewhere to live So I thought Perhaps if I made these ants some apartments they'll move in So I did And how I set about that I got some splinters of wood And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass constructed this little apartment Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished But I thought perhaps the ant won't know it'll probably move in And so they did That was a bit crude at the time And I made all these little apartments and little merry-go-rounds seesaws and swings little ladders And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that And then I sat down and all the ants came along And all I could hear was Is this for us And I say Yes they're all for you And they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent And from there I was watching this little world It became part of me When I discovered that I had this gift I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge So I started to educate myself on this molecular level And as I got older I continued I showed my mother My mother told me to take it smaller Now I shall show you something here And I'll explain As you can see that's a pinhead Now that is called the Huf Haus The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf And he says to me Willard can you put my house on a pinhead So I say How are you going to fit in there And then he said to me I don't believe you can do it Can you really do it And I says Well try me And then he said But I don't believe that you can do this So I said OK So to cut a long story short I went home went underneath the microscope and I crushed up a piece of glass crushed it up And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass Some of them were quite jagged So I was crushing up these pieces of glass which as you can see that's the actual frame of the house And the actual roof is made up of a fiber which I found in my sister's old teddy bear So I got the teddy bear and I said Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers So I did And I looked at it beneath the microscope And some of it was flat So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system And then I work between my heartbeat I have one-and-a-half seconds to actually move And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work at the same time Because that has happened to me So what I did like I said come back to the glass I found these little bits of glass And I had to make them square So I'm thinking How can I do this So what I did I got an oilstone Broke the edge of an oilstone off And what I did I took pieces of glass And I started to rub them I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass And then I started rubbing very very gently till some of the edges were quite square And then I constructed it And how I constructed it is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead And then pushing the glass in with its own friction And as I was doing it what happened The instrument that I used turned into a catapult And it went like this 。。 And then that was it Gone So I'm thinking Mr Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere So to cut the story short I decided that I had to go back and do it So I found some more And I decided to sort of construct it very very slowly holding my breath working between my heartbeat and making sure everything is leveled Because it's such a small sculpture nothing can go wrong And I decided to build it up Then I used fibers out of my jumper which I held and stretched And made the beams going around the house And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things which sent me insane But I managed to do it And when I finished it I came back the next day I noticed that the house was occupied Have we ever heard of a dust mite Darren dust mite and his family moved in So basically I'd completed the house And there you are Right As you can see Bart Simpson is having a little argument I think they're arguing about the space on the pin There's not enough room for the two of them So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off I think he was just warning him actually But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt What I did I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle Audience: No WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very very slowly manipulating the plastic cutting it because it behaves different Whenever you work on that level things behave different Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air And you know all different things happen But I had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop it moving Then static electricity set in And it went 。。 And I'm trying to remove it And the static is interfering with everything So there is sweat dripping off my head because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that in that position And after I've cut out the shape then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck So after I've done the same thing then I have to paint it And after I've actually sculpted them I have to paint them I experimented with a -- I found a dead fly And I plucked the hair off the fly's head Decided to make a paintbrush But I would never do it to a living fly Because I've heard a fly in pain And they go Meow Ow Even though they get on our nerves I would never kill an insect because All creatures great and small -- there is a hymn that says that So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face And I looked at it underneath the microscope That was the paintbrush And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful because the paint starts to turn into little blobs And it starts to dry very quickly So I have to be very quick If I'm not it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else So I have to be very very careful This one took me approximately I would say six to seven weeks My work rough estimate sometimes five six to seven weeks; you can't always anticipate As you can see that's Charlton Heston brought down to size He says to me Willard -- You can see him saying Why me I says I enjoyed your film That's why As you can see there's an aphid fly there That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture I would say it probably measures 。。 a quarter of a millimeter In America they say a period stop So say if you cut a period stop in half a full stop that's about the size of the whole thing It's made -- the chariot is made of gold And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber which I took out of the air When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers And what I normally do is walk 'round a room -- -- trying to find one And then I put it underneath the microscope I remember one time I was doing it and the window was open And there was a lady standing by the bus stop And she saw me walking around like this And then she looked at me And then I went 。。 And then she went Hmm OK he's not mad Yeah to actually do this thing -- the actual chariot is made of gold I had a 24-karat gold ring And I cut off a little flake of gold And I bent it 'round and made it into the chariot And the horse is made from nylon And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action When I did this one a gentleman seen it and said to me There's no way you can do this you must have used some kind of machine There's no way a man can do that It must be a machine So I says OK then if you say it's a machine 。。 That one took me approximately six weeks The most famous statue in the world This one I would say was a serious challenge Because I had to put the torch on the top That one is more or less the same type of process The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base Well I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of you know the beginning of people coming to America So it's sort of Ellis Island and seeing America for the first time And that's the first thing they saw So I wanted to have that little image And this is it And we all know that is the Hulk I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle Because we know we see needles but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it So I broke the needle And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it It's -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle to shove his feet in So most of my work I don't use glue They go in with their own friction And that's how I managed to do it As you can see he's looking at the moment He's got a little grimace on his face And his mouth must be probably about three microns So the eyes are probably about one micron or something That ship there that's made from 24-karat gold And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider But I had to rig it with strands of glue Because the web of the spider it was sending me insane because I couldn't get the web to move off And that's 24-karat gold And it's constructed I built it Constructed each plank of gold And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right As you can see dressage It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing And that was done with a particle from my shirt And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle It's very painstaking work but the best things come in small packages Willard Wigan These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures They're bizzarre they're beautiful and there's very little we know about them These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book I was about five years old at the time and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world And now a few years later I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet the Sahara I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist Unfortunately all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II From these drawings we know that this creature which lived about 100 million years ago was very big it had tall spines on its back forming a magnificent sail and it had long slender jaws a bit like a crocodile with conical teeth that may have been used to catch slippery prey like fish But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria a place called the Kem Kem It's a difficult place to work in You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions and it's very difficult to find good fossils there But our hard work paid off We discovered many incredible specimens There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs medium-sized predatory dinosaurs and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters These fossils were deposited in a river system The river system was also home to a giant car-sized coelacanth a monster sawfish flying reptiles It was a pretty dangerous place not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point Finally very recently we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus We returned to the site we collected more bones And so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature And we were able to reconstruct it We now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile very different from other predatory dinosaurs very different from the T rex But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton We had long spines the spines forming the big sail We had leg bones we had skull bones we had paddle-shaped feet wide feet -- again very unusual no other dinosaur has feet like this -- and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones and it turns out that they're very dense and compact Again this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water it's useful for buoyancy control in the water We C。T。-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton And when we looked at the digital skeleton we realized that yes this was a dinosaur unlike any other It's bigger than a T rex and yes the head has fish-eating written all over it but really the entire skeleton has water-loving written all over it -- dense bone paddle-like feet and the hind limbs are reduced in size and again this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water So as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus -- I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin -- we realize that we're dealing with a river monster a predatory dinosaur bigger than T rex the ruler of this ancient river of giants feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery It's a dinosaur like no other And some people told me Wow this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery There are not many things left to discover in the world Well I think nothing could be further from the truth I think the Sahara's still full of treasures and when people tell me there are no places left to explore I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter Roy Chapman Andrews and he said Always there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines And it is still true today Thank you This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007 We made this kindergarten to be a circle It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof If you are a parent you know that kids love to keep making circles This is how the rooftop looks And why did we design this The principal of this kindergarten said No I don't want a handrail I said It's impossible But he insisted: How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof So that it can catch the children falling off I said It's impossible And of course the government official said Of course you have to have a handrail But we could keep that idea around the trees There are three trees popping through And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail But of course rope has nothing to do with them They fall into the net And you get more and more more Sometimes 40 children are around a tree The boy on the branch he loves the tree so he is eating the tree And at the time of an event they sit on the edge It looks so nice from underneath Monkeys in the zoo Feeding time And we made the roof as low as possible because we wanted to see children on top of the roof not only underneath the roof And if the roof is too high you see only the ceiling And the leg washing place -- there are many kinds of water taps You see with the flexible tubes you want to spray water to your friends and the shower and the one in front is quite normal But if you look at this the boy is not washing his boots he's putting water into his boots This kindergarten is completely open most of the year And there is no boundary between inside and outside So it means basically this architecture is a roof And also there is no boundary between classrooms So there is no acoustic barrier at all When you put many children in a quiet box some of them get really nervous But in this kindergarten there is no reason they get nervous Because there is no boundary And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room we let him go He will come back eventually because it's a circle it comes back But the point is in that kind of occasion usually children try to hide somewhere But here just they leave and come back It's a natural process And secondly we consider noise very important You know that children sleep better in noise They don't sleep in a quiet space And in this kindergarten these children show amazing concentration in class And you know our kind grew up in the jungle with noise They need noise You are not supposed to be in silence And you know these days we are trying to make everything under control You know it's completely open we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter In summer you go swimming The sand is 50 degrees And also you should know that you are waterproof You never melt in rain So children are supposed to be outside So that is how we should treat them This is how they divide classrooms They are supposed to help teachers They don't I didn't put him in A classroom And a washbasin They talk to each other around the well And there are always some trees in the classroom A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above Monkeys And each classroom has at least one skylight And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas This is the annex building right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten The building is only five meters tall with seven floors And of course the ceiling height is very low So you have to consider safety So we put our children a daughter and a son They tried to go in He hit his head He's okay His skull is quite strong He is resilient It's my son And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off And then we put other children The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo as you know The driver in front she needs to learn how to drive Now these days kids need a small dosage of danger And in this kind of occasion they learn to help each other Now this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30 And the circumference of this building is 183 meters So it's not exactly small at all And this boy did 6，000 meters in the morning But the surprise is yet to come The children in this kindergarten do 4，000 meters on average And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens The principal says I don't train them We leave them on top of the roof Just like sheep They keep running My point is don't control them don't protect them too much and they need to tumble sometimes They need to get some injury And that makes them learn how to live in this world I think architecture is capable of changing this world and people's lives And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children Thank you very much I dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams When we think about the dreams we have and the dent we want to leave in the universe it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have and projects that never happen So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams One: Believe in overnight success You know the story right The tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money You know the story may seem real but I bet it's incomplete If you go investigate further the guy has done 30 apps before and he has done a master's on the topic a Ph。D He has been working on the topic for 20 years This is really interesting I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success I come from a humble family and two weeks before the deadline to apply to MIT I started the application process And voila I got in People may think it's an overnight success but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that I took life and education seriously Your overnight success story is always a result of everything you've done in your life through that moment Two: Believe someone else has the answers for you Constantly people want to help out right All sorts of people: your family your friends your business partners they all have opinions on which path you should take: And let me tell you go through this pipe But whenever you go inside there are other ways you have to pick as well And you need to make those decisions yourself No one else has the perfect answers for your life And you need to keep picking those decisions right The pipes are infinite and you're going to bump your head and it's a part of the process Three and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed So when your life is going great you have put together a great team and you have growing revenue and everything is set -- time to settle When I launched my first book I worked really really hard to distribute it everywhere in Brazil With that over three million people downloaded it over 50，000 people bought physical copies When I wrote a sequel some impact was guaranteed Even if I did little sales would be okay But okay is never okay When you're growing towards a peak you need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak Maybe if I did little a couple hundred thousand people would read it and that's great already But if I work harder than ever I can bring this number up to millions That's why I decided with my new book to go to every single state of Brazil And I can already see a higher peak There's no time to settle down Fourth tip and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's I constantly see people saying Yes I had this great idea but no investor had the vision to invest Oh I created this great product but the market is so bad the sales didn't go well Or I can't find good talent; my team is so below expectations If you have dreams it's your responsibility to make them happen Yes it may be hard to find talent Yes the market may be bad But if no one invested in your idea if no one bought your product for sure there is something there that is your fault Definitely You need to get your dreams and make them happen And no one achieved their goals alone But if you didn't make them happen it's your fault and no one else's Be responsible for your dreams And one last tip and this one is really important as well: Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves Once I saw an ad and it was a lot of friends they were going up a mountain it was a very high mountain and it was a lot of work You could see that they were sweating and this was tough And they were going up and they finally made it to the peak Of course they decided to celebrate right I'm going to celebrate so Yes We made it we're at the top Two seconds later one looks at the other and says Okay let's go down Life is never about the goals themselves Life is about the journey Yes you should enjoy the goals themselves but people think that you have dreams and whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams it's a magical place where happiness will be all around But achieving a dream is a momentary sensation and your life is not The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey That's the best way And your journey is simple -- it's made of steps Some steps will be right on Sometimes you will trip If it's right on celebrate because some people wait a lot to celebrate And if you tripped turn that into something to learn If every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate you will for sure enjoy the journey So five tips: Believe in overnight success believe someone else has the answers for you believe that when growth is guaranteed you should settle down believe the fault is someone else's and believe that only the goals themselves matter Believe me if you do that you will destroy your dreams Thank you When I was a kid the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement filled with cans of food and water When the nuclear attack came we were supposed to go downstairs hunker down and eat out of that barrel Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this Instead it looks like this If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war Not missiles but microbes Now part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic We're not ready for the next epidemic Let's look at Ebola I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper lots of tough challenges I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication And as you look at what went on the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough the problem was that we didn't have a system at all In fact there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone seen what the disease was seen how far it had spread The case reports came in on paper It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate We didn't have a medical team ready to go We didn't have a way of preparing people Now Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers But even so we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers There was no one there to look at treatment approaches No one to look at the diagnostics No one to figure out what tools should be used As an example we could have taken the blood of survivors processed it and put that plasma back in people to protect them But that was never tried So there was a lot that was missing And these things are really a global failure The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics but not to do these things I talked about Now in the movies it's quite different There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go they move in they save the day but that's just pure Hollywood The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year About 10，000 people died and nearly all were in the three West African countries There's three reasons why it didn't spread more The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers They found the people and they prevented more infections The second is the nature of the virus Ebola does not spread through the air And by the time you're contagious most people are so sick that they're bedridden Third it didn't get into many urban areas And that was just luck If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas the case numbers would have been much larger So next time we might not be so lucky You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola or it could be bioterrorism So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse In fact let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air like the Spanish Flu back in 1918 So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very very quickly And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic So this is a serious problem We should be concerned But in fact we can build a really good response system We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen So we can have tools but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system And we need preparedness The best lessons I think on how to get prepared are again what we do for war For soldiers we have full-time waiting to go We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly NATO does a lot of war games to check are people well trained Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies So they are absolutely ready to go So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic What are the key pieces First we need strong health systems in poor countries That's where mothers can give birth safely kids can get all their vaccines But also where we'll see the outbreak very early on We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise And then we need to pair those medical people with the military taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast do logistics and secure areas We need to do simulations germ games not war games so that we see where the holes are The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001 and it didn't go so well So far the score is germs: 1 people: 0 Finally we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics There are some big breakthroughs like the Adeno-associated virus that could work very very quickly Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic The primary healthcare the R&amp;D those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe So I think this should absolutely be a priority There's no need to panic We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement But we need to get going because time is not on our side In fact if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic it's that it can serve as an early warning a wake-up call to get ready If we start now we can be ready for the next epidemic Thank you People back home call me a heckler a troublemaker an irritant a rebel an activist the voice of the people But that wasn't always me Growing up I had a nickname They used to call me Softy meaning the soft harmless boy Like every other human being I avoided trouble In my childhood they taught me silence Don't argue do as you're told In Sunday school they taught me don't confront don't argue even if you're right turn the other cheek Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich Kenya's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals This was reinforced by the political climate of the day We had a president Moi who was a dictator He ruled the country with an iron fist and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested tortured jailed or even killed That meant that people were taught to be smart cowards stay out of trouble Being a coward was not an insult Being a coward was a compliment We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother What that meant: that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive I used to question this advice and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya and the results were violently disputed What followed that election was terrible violence rape and the killing of over 1，000 people My work was to document the violence As a photographer I took thousands of images and after two months the two politicians came together had a cup of tea signed a peace agreement and the country moved on I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand I saw the killings I saw the displacement I met women who had been raped and it disturbed me but the country never spoke about it We pretended We all became smart cowards We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it Ten months later I quit my job I said I could not stand it anymore After quitting my job I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country to speak about the state of the nation and June 1 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention It's a national holiday it's broadcast across the country and I showed up at the stadium My friends did not show up I found myself alone and I didn't know what to do I was scared but I knew very well that that particular day I had to make a decision Was I able to live as a coward like everyone else or was I going to make a stand And when the president stood up to speak I found myself on my feet shouting at the president telling him to remember the post-election violence victims to stop the corruption And suddenly out of nowhere the police pounced on me like hungry lions They held my mouth and dragged me out of the stadium where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail I spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail and that got me thinking What was making me feel this way My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did and the images that I took were disturbing my life The images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans Most Kenyans did not see the violence It was a story to them And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it We traveled the country and showed the images and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path where I decided to become silent no more to talk about those things We traveled and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country talking about corruption bad leadership We have even done symbolic burials We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament as a symbol of our politicians' greed It has been done in Uganda and other countries and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country across the continent Where I used to stand up alone seven years ago now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country who want to bring about change and they're no longer afraid and they're no longer smart cowards So that was my story That day in the stadium I stood up as a smart coward By that one action I said goodbye to the 24 years living as a coward There are two most powerful days in your life: the day you're born and the day you discover why That day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President I discovered why I was truly born that I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice Do you know why you were born Thank you It's an amazing story I just want to ask you a couple quick questions So PAWA254: you've created a studio a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action What's happening now with PAWA Boniface Mwangi: So we have this community of filmmakers graffiti artists musicians and when there's an issue in the country we come together we brainstorm and take up on that issue So our most powerful tool is art because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life and they don't have time to read So we package our activism and we package our message in art So from the music the graffiti the art that's what we do Can I say one more thing Yeah of course BM: In spite of being arrested beaten up threatened the moment I discovered my voice that I could actually stand up for what I really believed in I'm no longer afraid I used to be called softy but I'm no longer softy and there's such beauty in doing that There's nothing as powerful as that knowing that I'm meant to do this because you don't get scared you just continue living your life Thank you G'day my name's Kevin I'm from Australia I'm here to help Tonight I want to talk about a tale of two cities One of those cities is called Washington and the other is called Beijing Because how these two capitals shape their future and the future of the United States and the future of China doesn't just affect those two countries it affects all of us in ways perhaps we've never thought of: the air we breathe the water we drink the fish we eat the quality of our oceans the languages we speak in the future the jobs we have the political systems we choose and of course the great questions of war and peace You see that bloke He's French His name is Napoleon A couple of hundred years ago he made this extraordinary projection: China is a sleeping lion and when she awakes the world will shake Napoleon got a few things wrong; he got this one absolutely right Because China is today not just woken up China has stood up and China is on the march and the question for us all is where will China go and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century You start looking at the numbers they start to confront you in a big way It's projected that China will become by whichever measure -- PPP market exchange rates -- the largest economy in the world over the course of the decade ahead They're already the largest trading nation already the largest exporting nation already the largest manufacturing nation and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world America comes second So if China does become the world's largest economy think about this: It'll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of England -- George III not a good friend of Napoleon's -- that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non-English speaking country a non-Western country a non-liberal democratic country And if you don't think that's going to affect the way in which the world happens in the future and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado So in short the question we have tonight is how do we understand this mega-change which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century It'll affect so many things It will go to the absolute core It's happening quietly It's happening persistently It's happening in some senses under the radar as we are all preoccupied with what's going in Ukraine what's going on in the Middle East what's going on with ISIS what's going on with ISIL what's happening with the future of our economies This is a slow and quiet revolution And with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge and the mega-challenge is this: Can these two great countries China and the United States -- China the Middle Kingdom and the United States Měiguó -- which in Chinese by the way means the beautiful country Think about that -- that's the name that China has given this country for more than a hundred years Whether these two great civilizations these two great countries can in fact carve out a common future for themselves and for the world In short can we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace And I have 15 minutes to work through war or peace which is a little less time than they gave this guy to write a book called War and Peace People ask me why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia got interested in learning Chinese Well there are two reasons for that Here's the first of them That's Betsy the cow Now Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle that I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia See those hands there These are not built for farming So very early on I discovered that in fact working in a farm was not designed for me and China was a very safe remove from any career in Australian farm life Here's the second reason That's my mom Anyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do Everyone ever do what their mom told them to do I rarely did but what my mom said to me was one day she handed me a newspaper a headline which said here we have a huge change And that change is China entering the United Nations 1971 I had just turned 14 years of age and she handed me this headline And she said Understand this learn this because it's going to affect your future So being a very good student of history I decided that the best thing for me to do was in fact to go off and learn Chinese The great thing about learning Chinese is that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name And so they gave me this name: Kè which means to overcome or to conquer and Wén and that's the character for literature or the arts Kè Wén Conqueror of the Classics Any of you guys called Kevin It's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics I've been called Kevin all my life Have you been called Kevin all your life Would you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics And so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service but here is where pride -- before pride there always comes a fall So there I am in the embassy in Beijing off to the Great Hall of the People with our ambassador who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting in the Great Hall of the People And so there was I If you've been to a Chinese meeting it's a giant horseshoe At the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh-bahs and down the end of the horseshoe are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs the junior woodchucks like me And so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase He said China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness And I thought to myself That sounds clumsy That sounds odd I will improve it Note to file: Never do that It needed to be a little more elegant a little more classical so I rendered it as follows In Chinese There was a big pause on the other side of the room You could see the giant pooh-bahs at the head of the horseshoe the blood visibly draining from their faces and the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe engaged in peals of unrestrained laughter Because when I rendered his sentence Australia and China are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness in fact what I said was that Australia and China were now experiencing fantastic orgasm That was the last time I was asked to interpret But in that little story there's a wisdom which is as soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization of 5，000 years of continuing history there's always something new to learn History is against us when it comes to the U。S and China forging a common future together This guy up here He's not Chinese and he's not American He's Greek His name's Thucydides He wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars And he made this extraordinary observation about Athens and Sparta It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable And hence a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap This guy here He's not American and he's not Greek He's Chinese His name is Sun Tzu He wrote The Art of War and if you see his statement underneath it's along these lines: Attack him where he is unprepared appear where you are not expected Not looking good so far for China and the United States This guy is an American His name's Graham Allison In fact he's a teacher at the Kennedy School over there in Boston He's working on a single project at the moment which is does the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war between rising powers and established great powers apply to the future of China-U。S relations It's a core question And what Graham has done is explore 15 cases in history since the 1500s to establish what the precedents are And in 11 out of 15 of them let me tell you they've ended in catastrophic war You may say But Kevin -- or Conqueror of the Classics -- that was the past We live now in a world of interdependence and globalization It could never happen again Guess what The economic historians tell us that in fact the time which we reached the greatest point of economic integration and globalization was in 1914 just before that happened World War I a sobering reflection from history So if we are engaged in this great question of how China thinks feels and positions itself towards the United States and the reverse how do we get to the baseline of how these two countries and civilizations can possibly work together Let me first go to in fact China's views of the U。S and the rest of the West Number one: China feels as if it's been humiliated at the hands of the West through a hundred years of history beginning with the Opium Wars When after that the Western powers carved China up into little pieces so that by the time it got to the '20s and '30s signs like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai No dogs and Chinese allowed How would you feel if you were Chinese in your own country if you saw that sign appear China also believes and feels as if in the events of 1919 at the Peace Conference in Paris when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world what about German colonies in China They were in fact given to Japan When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China And then on top of that the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system China also believes that it is being contained by U。S allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U。S right around its periphery And beyond all that the Chinese have this feeling in their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts that those of us in the collective West are just too damned arrogant That is we don't recognize the problems in our own system in our politics and our economics and are very quick to point the finger elsewhere and believe that in fact we in the collective West are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy Of course in international relations it's not just the sound of one hand clapping There's another country too and that's called the U。S So how does the U。S respond to all of the above The U。S has a response to each of those On the question of is the U。S containing China they say No look at the history of the Soviet Union That was containment Instead what we have done in the U。S and the West is welcome China into the global economy and on top of that welcome them into the World Trade Organization The U。S and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights and through cyberattacks on U。S and global firms Furthermore the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance in the U。S and the collective West And on top of all the above what does the United States say That they fear that China will when it has sufficient power establish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia boot the United States out and in time when it's powerful enough unilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order So apart from all of that it's just fine and dandy the U。S。-China relationship No real problems there The challenge though is given those deep-rooted feelings those deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns what the Chinese call Sīwéi ways of thinking how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two I argue simply this: We can do it on the basis on a framework of constructive realism for a common purpose What do I mean by that Be realistic about the things that we disagree on and a management approach that doesn't enable any one of those differences to break into war or conflict until we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them Be constructive in areas of the bilateral regional and global engagement between the two which will make a difference for all of humankind Build a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia an Asia-Pacific community And worldwide act further like you've begun to do at the end of last year by striking out against climate change with hands joined together rather than fists apart Of course all that happens if you've got a common mechanism and political will to achieve the above These things are deliverable But the question is are they deliverable alone This is what our head tells us we need to do but what about our heart I have a little experience in the question back home of how you try to bring together two peoples who frankly haven't had a whole lot in common in the past And that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples This was a day of reckoning in the Australian government the Australian parliament and for the Australian people After 200 years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians it was high time that we white folks said we were sorry The important thing -- The important thing that I remember is staring in the faces of all those from Aboriginal Australia as they came to listen to this apology It was extraordinary to see for example old women telling me the stories of when they were five years old and literally ripped away from their parents like this lady here It was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace and to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building and one woman said to me it's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life and she was over 70 That's a terrible story And then I remember this family saying to me You know we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra to come to this thing drove our way through redneck country On the way back stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake And they walked into this cafe quietly tentatively gingerly a little anxious I think you know what I'm talking about But the day after the apology what happened Everyone in that cafe every one of the white folks stood up and applauded Something had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia The white folks our Aboriginal brothers and sisters and we haven't solved all these problems together but let me tell you there was a new beginning because we had gone not just to the head we'd gone also to the heart So where does that conclude in terms of the great question that we've been asked to address this evening which is the future of U。S。-China relations The head says there's a way forward The head says there is a policy framework there's a common narrative there's a mechanism through regular summitry to do these things and to make them better But the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities of the America-China relationship and the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world Sometimes folks we just need to take a leap of faith not quite knowing where we might land In China they now talk about the Chinese Dream In America we're all familiar with the term the American Dream I think it's time across the world that we're able to think also of something we might also call a dream for all humankind Because if we do that we might just change the way that we think about each other In Chinese That's my challenge to America That's my challenge to China That's my challenge to all of us but I think where there's a will and where there is imagination we can turn this into a future driven by peace and prosperity and not once again repeat the tragedies of war I thank you Thanks so much for that Thanks so much for that It feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging You in a way are uniquely placed to speak to both sides Kevin Rudd: Well what we Australians do best is organize the drinks so you get them together in one room and we suggest this and suggest that then we go and get the drinks But no look for all of us who are friends of these two great countries America and China you can do something You can make a practical contribution and for all you good folks here next time you meet someone from China sit down and have a conversation See what you can find out about where they come from and what they think and my challenge for all the Chinese folks who are going to watch this TED Talk at some time is do the same Two of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference Those of us up the middle we can make a small contribution Kevin all power to you my friend Thank you KR: Thank you Thank you folks When I wrote my memoir the publishers were really confused Was it about me as a child refugee or as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s one that went public and eventually employed over 8，500 people Or was it as a mother of an autistic child Or as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money Well it turns out I'm all of these So let me tell you my story All that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna part of the Kindertransport that saved nearly 10，000 Jewish children from Nazi Europe I was five years old clutching the hand of my nine-year-old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on What is England and why am I going there I'm only alive because so long ago I was helped by generous strangers I was lucky and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents But sadly I never bonded with them again But I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than I would ever have dreamed possible And I love England my adopted country with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel I decided to make mine a life that was worth saving And then I just got on with it Let me take you back to the early 1960s To get past the gender issues of the time I set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain But it was also a company of women a company for women an early social business And people laughed at the very idea because software at that time was given away free with hardware Nobody would buy software certainly not from a woman Although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees there was a glass ceiling to our progress And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often and I wanted opportunities for women I recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected and structured them into a home-working organization We pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break We pioneered all sorts of new flexible work methods: job shares profit-sharing and eventually co-ownership at no cost to anyone but me For years I was the first woman this or the only woman that And in those days I couldn't work on the stock exchange I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane Indeed I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay Nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities And I couldn't really face that so I started to challenge the conventions of the time even to the extent of changing my name from Stephanie to Steve that he was a she couldn't have started smaller: on the dining room table and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today's terms and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house My interests were scientific the market was commercial -- things such as payroll which I found rather boring So I had to compromise with operational research work which had the intellectual challenge that interested me and the commercial value that was valued by the clients: things like scheduling freight trains time-tabling buses stock control lots and lots of stock control And eventually the work came in We disguised the domestic and part-time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices one of the very first to do so And who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of Supersonic Concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes All we used was a simple trust the staff approach and a simple telephone We even used to ask job applicants Do you have access to a telephone An early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols And software was and still is a maddeningly hard-to-control activity so that was enormously valuable We used the standards ourselves we were even paid to update them over the years and eventually they were adopted by NATO Our programmers -- remember only women including gay and transgender -- worked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts defining each task to be done And they then wrote code usually machine code sometimes binary code which was then sent by mail to a data center to be punched onto paper tape or card and then re-punched in order to verify it All this before it ever got near a computer That was programming in the early 1960s In 1975 13 years from startup equal opportunity legislation came in in Britain and that made it illegal to have our pro-female policies And as an example of unintended consequences When I started my company of women the men said How interesting because it only works because it's small And later as it became sizable they accepted Yes it is sizable now but of no strategic interest And later when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars and I'd made 70 of the staff into millionaires they sort of said Well done Steve You can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads: They're flat on top for being patted patronizingly And we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink Let me share with you two secrets of success: Surround yourself with first-class people and people that you like; and choose your partner very very carefully Because the other day when I said My husband's an angel a woman complained -- You're lucky she said mine's still alive If success were easy we'd all be millionaires Our late son Giles was an only child a beautiful contented baby And then at two and a half like a changeling in a fairy story he lost the little speech that he had and turned into a wild unmanageable toddler he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again Giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up to pioneer services for autism And then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school for pupils with autism and a medical research charity again all for autism Because whenever I found a gap in services I tried to help I like doing new things and making new things happen And I've just started a three-year think tank for autism And so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems I've also founded the Oxford Internet Institute and other IT ventures The Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology but on the social economic legal and ethical issues of the Internet Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now And I have learned to live without him and I have learned to live without his need of me Philanthropy is all that I do now I need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise but as many people in this room will know making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy self-belief and determination the courage to risk family and home and a 24/7 commitment that borders on the obsessive So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility We live our lives forward So what has all that taught me I learned that tomorrow's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday And that made me able to cope with change indeed eventually to welcome change though I'm told I'm still very difficult Thank you very much Tonight I'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person's life and in yours When I was 22 years old I was lucky enough to find my calling when I fell into making radio stories At almost the exact same time I found out that my dad who I was very very close to was gay I was taken completely by surprise We were a very tight-knit family and I was crushed At some point in one of our strained conversations my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots He told me that one night in 1969 a group of young black and Latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan called the Stonewall Inn and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement It was an amazing story and it piqued my interest So I decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more With the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the Stonewall Inn that night Recording these interviews I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience I dedicated the program to my dad it changed my relationship with him and it changed my life Over the next 15 years I made many more radio documentaries working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media Over and over again I'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people particularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter I could literally see people's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone In 1998 I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the Bowery in Manhattan Guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades They lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next Later I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang I remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page He stood there staring at it in silence then he grabbed the book out of my hand and started running down the long narrow hallway holding it over his head shouting I exist I exist In many ways I exist became the clarion call for StoryCorps this crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago The thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head Traditionally broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people but I wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work and see if we could give many many many people the chance to be listened to in this way So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago we built a booth where anyone can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their life You come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside You sit across from say your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk Many people think of it as if this was to be our last conversation what would I want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me At the end of the session you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress so that your great-great-great-grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story So we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being I had no idea if it would work but from the very beginning it did People treated the experience with incredible respect and amazing conversations happened inside I want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth This is 12-year-old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother Sarah Josh has Asperger's syndrome As you may know kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart but have a tough time socially They usually have obsessions In Josh's case it's with animals so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10 do you think your life would be different without animals Sarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals because they add so much pleasure to life JL: How else do you think your life would be different without them SL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes JL: Well I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous or constrict you or anything SL: Yeah I'm not a big snake person -- JL: But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate SL: Yeah it really is JL: Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child SL: I remember when you were a baby you had really bad colic so you would just cry and cry JL: What's colic SL: It's when you get this stomach ache and all you do is scream for like four hours JL: Even louder than Amy does SL: You were pretty loud but Amy's was more high-pitched JL: I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more like she's the perfect little angel SL: Well I can understand why you think that people like Amy more and I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome but being friendly comes easily to Amy whereas I think for you it's more difficult but the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos SL: Yeah -- JL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity SL: I wouldn't judge the quality but I think -- JL: I mean first it was like Amy loved Claudia then she hated Claudia she loved Claudia then she hated Claudia SL: Part of that's a girl thing honey The important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends and really that's what you need in life JL: Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born Did I meet your expectations SL: You've exceeded my expectations sweetie because sure you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like but you have made me grow so much as a parent because you think -- JL: Well I was the one who made you a parent SL: You were the one who made me a parent That's a good point But also because you think differently from what they tell you in the parenting books I really had to learn to think outside of the box with you and it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person and I'll always thank you for that JL: And that helped when Amy was born SL: And that helped when Amy was born but you are so incredibly special to me and I'm so lucky to have you as my son David Isay: After this story ran on public radio Josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was His mom Sarah bound them together in a book and when Josh got picked on at school they would read the letters together I just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight Sarah Littman and her son Josh who is now an honors student in college You know a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories and it's not because they're sad Most of them aren't I think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment when sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's an advertisement It's kind of the anti-reality TV Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich Nobody comes to get famous It's simply an act of generosity and love So many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness courage decency and dignity and when you hear that kind of story it can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground So this experiment in Grand Central worked and we expanded across the country Today more than 100，000 people in all 50 states in thousands of cities and towns across America have recorded StoryCorps interviews It's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered We've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps traveling the country gathering the wisdom of humanity They call it bearing witness and if you ask them all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good And I think for the first years of StoryCorps you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country -- rich poor five years old to 105 80 different languages across the political spectrum -- you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something I've also learned so much from these interviews I've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen like this interview between a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her Danny Perasa: You see the thing of it is I always feel guilty when I say I love you to you And I say it so often I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am it's coming from me It's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house Annie Perasa: If I don't have a note on the kitchen table I think there's something wrong You write a love letter to me every morning DP: Well the only thing that could possibly be wrong is I couldn't find a silly pen AP: To my princess: The weather outside today is extremely rainy I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning DP: It's a romantic weather report AP: And I love you I love you I love you DP: When a guy is happily married no matter what happens at work no matter what happens in the rest of the day there's a shelter when you get home there's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying Get your hands off me Being married is like having a color television set You never want to go back to black and white DI: Danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth but Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of Hollywood's leading men put together What else have I learned I've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive I've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength Like an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson When Oshea was a teenager he murdered Mary's only son Laramiun Byrd in a gang fight A dozen years later Mary went to prison to meet Oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son's life Slowly and remarkably they became friends and when he was finally released from the penitentiary Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary This is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had soon after Oshea was freed Mary Johnson: My natural son is no longer here I didn't see him graduate and now you're going to college I'll have the opportunity to see you graduate I didn't see him get married Hopefully one day I'll be able to experience that with you Oshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation It motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path You still believe in me and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you it's amazing MJ: I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together even with us sitting here looking at each other right now I know it's not an easy thing so I admire that you can do this OI: I love you lady MJ: I love you too son DI: And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people and how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice Like the story of Alexis Martinez who was born Arthur Martinez in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago In the interview she talks with her daughter Lesley about joining a gang as a young man and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley Alexis Martinez: One of the most difficult things for me was I was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed to be in my granddaughters' lives and you blew that completely out of the water you and your husband One of the fruits of that is in my relationship with my granddaughters they fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she Lesley Martinez: But they're free to talk about it AM: They're free to talk about it but that to me is a miracle LM: You don't have to apologize You don't have to tiptoe We're not going to cut you off and that's something I've always wanted you to just know that you're loved AM: You know I live this every day now I walk down the streets as a woman and I really am at peace with who I am I mean I wish I had a softer voice maybe but now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day DI: Now I walk in love I'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps It takes some courage to have these conversations StoryCorps speaks to our mortality Participants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying He wrote a book called The Four Things That Matter Most about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die: thank you I love you forgive me I forgive you They're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another and often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth It's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about -- no regrets nothing left unsaid And it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right So the TED Prize When I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago about the possibility of the Prize I was completely floored They asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity no more than 50 words So I thought about it I wrote my 50 words and a few weeks later Chris called and said Go for it So here is my wish: that you will help us take everything we've learned through StoryCorps and bring it to the world so that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history How are we going to do that With this We're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these and it has powers I never could have imagined 11 years ago when I started StoryCorps It has a microphone it can tell you how to do things and it can send audio files Those are the key ingredients So the first part of the wish is already underway Over the past couple of months the team at StoryCorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone anywhere anytime Remember StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation which is preserved forever but at this very moment we're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app The app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the StoryCorps interview process helps you pick questions and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful StoryCorps interview and then with one tap upload it to our archive at the Library of Congress That's the easy part the technology The real challenge is up to you: to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across America and around the world so that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year we could potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more Imagine for example a national homework assignment where every high school student studying U。S history across the country records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving so that in one single weekend an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured Or imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people and in doing so begin to build bonds of trust; or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a StoryCorps interview on their 75th birthday; or that people in your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and ask them who they are what they've learned in life and how they want to be remembered Ten years ago I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist and became a well-known gay activist This is the picture of us at that interview I never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago when my dad who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients 40 hours a week was diagnosed with cancer He passed away very suddenly a few days later It was June 28 2012 the anniversary of the Stonewall riots I listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died I have a couple of young kids at home and I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did but it was at that moment that I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings Every day people come up to me and say I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother but I waited too long Now no one has to wait anymore At this moment when so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential join us in creating this digital archive of conversations that are enduring and important Help us create this gift to our children this testament to who we are as human beings I hope you'll help us make this wish come true Interview a family member a friend or even a stranger Together we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity and maybe in doing so we'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less Maybe these conversations will remind us what's really important And maybe just maybe it will help us recognize that simple truth that every life every single life matters equally and infinitely Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Thank you Let me show you something Girl: Okay that's a cat sitting in a bed The boy is petting the elephant Those are people that are going on an airplane That's a big airplane Fei-Fei Li: This is a three-year-old child describing what she sees in a series of photos She might still have a lot to learn about this world but she's already an expert at one very important task: to make sense of what she sees Our society is more technologically advanced than ever We send people to the moon we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like Yet our most advanced machines and computers still struggle at this task So I'm here today to give you a progress report on the latest advances in our research in computer vision one of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary technologies in computer science Yes we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves but without smart vision they cannot really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road which can be run over and a rock that size which should be avoided We have made fabulous megapixel cameras but we have not delivered sight to the blind Drones can fly over massive land but don't have enough vision technology to help us to track the changes of the rainforests Security cameras are everywhere but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool Photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life They're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human or teams of humans could hope to view and you and I are contributing to that at this TED Yet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding and managing this enormous content So in other words collectively as a society we're very much blind because our smartest machines are still blind Why is this so hard you may ask by converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers known as pixels but these are just lifeless numbers They do not carry meaning in themselves Just like to hear is not the same as to listen to take pictures is not the same as to see In fact it took Mother Nature 540 million years of hard work to do this task and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains not the eyes themselves So vision begins with the eyes but it truly takes place in the brain So for 15 years now starting from my Ph。D at Caltech and then leading Stanford's Vision Lab I've been working with my mentors collaborators and students to teach computers to see Our research field is called computer vision and machine learning It's part of the general field of artificial intelligence So ultimately we want to teach the machines to see just like we do: naming objects identifying people inferring 3D geometry of things understanding relations emotions actions and intentions You and I weave together entire stories of people places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them The first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects the building block of the visual world In its simplest terms imagine this teaching process of a particular object let's say cats and designing a model that learns from these training images How hard can this be After all a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors and this is what we did in the early days of object modeling We'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language that a cat has a round face a chubby body two pointy ears and a long tail and that looked all fine But what about this cat It's all curled up Now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model But what if cats are hidden What about these silly cats Now you get my point Even something as simple as a household pet can present an infinite number of variations to the object model and that's just one object So about eight years ago a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking No one tells a child how to see especially in the early years They learn this through real-world experiences and examples If you consider a child's eyes as a pair of biological cameras they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds the average time an eye movement is made So by age three a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world So instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data in both quantity and quality Once we know this we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before perhaps thousands of times more and together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University we launched the ImageNet project in 2007 Luckily we didn't have to mount a camera on our head and wait for many years We went to the Internet the biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created We downloaded nearly a billion images to help us to label these images At its peak ImageNet was one of the biggest employers of the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers: together almost 50，000 workers a child's mind takes in in the early developmental years In hindsight this idea of using big data to train computer algorithms may seem obvious now but back in 2007 it was not so obvious We were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while Some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure and we were constantly struggling for research funding Once I even joked to my graduate students that I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet After all that's how I funded my college years So we carried on In 2009 the ImageNet project delivered a database of 15 million images organized by everyday English words In both quantity and quality this was an unprecedented scale As an example in the case of cats we have more than 62，000 cats of all kinds of looks and poses and across all species of domestic and wild cats We were thrilled to have put together ImageNet and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it so in the TED fashion we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free we're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves As it turned out the wealth of information provided by ImageNet was a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms called convolutional neural network pioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun back in the 1970s and '80s Just like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons Moreover these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers also similar to the brain In a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model it has 24 million nodes 140 million parameters Powered by the massive data from ImageNet and the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected It became the winning architecture to generate exciting new results in object recognition and where the cat is Of course there are more things than cats so here's a computer algorithm telling us the picture contains a boy and a teddy bear; a dog a person and a small kite in the background; like a man a skateboard railings a lampost and so on Sometimes when the computer is not so confident about what it sees we have taught it to be smart enough to give us a safe answer instead of committing too much but other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us what exactly the objects are like the make model year of the cars and we have learned something really interesting: first it confirmed our common wisdom that car prices correlate very well with household incomes But surprisingly car prices also correlate well with crime rates in cities or voting patterns by zip codes So wait a minute Is that it Has the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities Not so fast So far we have just taught the computer to see objects This is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns It's an incredible accomplishment but it's only the first step Soon another developmental milestone will be hit So instead of saying this is a cat in the picture you already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed So to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences the marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm like visual snippets with words and phrases in sentences About four months ago we finally tied all this together and produced one of the first computer vision models that is capable of generating a human-like sentence when it sees a picture for the first time Now I'm ready to show you what the computer says that the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk Computer: A man is standing next to an elephant A large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway FFL: Of course we're still working hard to improve our algorithms and it still has a lot to learn And the computer still makes mistakes Computer: A cat lying on a bed in a blanket FFL: So of course when it sees too many cats it thinks everything might look like a cat Computer: A young boy is holding a baseball bat FFL: Or if it hasn't seen a toothbrush it confuses it with a baseball bat Computer: A man riding a horse down a street next to a building FFL: We haven't taught Art 101 to the computers Computer: A zebra standing in a field of grass FFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature So it has been a long journey To get from age zero to three was hard The real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond Let me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again So far we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture Computer: A person sitting at a table with a cake FFL: But there's so much more to this picture than just a person and a cake What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time The boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt given to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney and you and I can all tell how happy he is and what's exactly on his mind at that moment This is my son Leo On my quest for visual intelligence and the future world he will live in When machines can see doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients Cars will run smarter and safer on the road Robots not just humans will help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded and explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines Little by little we're giving sight to the machines First we teach them to see Then they help us to see better For the first time human eyes won't be the only ones This is my quest: to give computers visual intelligence and to create a better future for Leo and for the world Thank you I'm thrilled to be here tonight to share with you something we've been working on for over two years and it's in the area of additive manufacturing also known as 3D printing You see this object here It looks fairly simple but it's quite complex at the same time It's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one In its context it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques It has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it You can't even manufacture it through milling This is a job for a 3D printer but most 3D printers would take between three and 10 hours to fabricate it and we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage during this 10-minute talk Wish us luck Now 3D printing is actually a misnomer It's actually 2D printing over and over again and it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2D printing Think about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters and then do that over and over again to build up a three-dimensional object In microelectronics they use something called lithography to do the same sort of thing to make the transistors and integrated circuits and build up a structure several times These are all 2D printing technologies Now I'm a chemist a material scientist too and my co-inventors are also material scientists one a chemist one a physicist and we began to be interested in 3D printing And very often as you know new ideas are often simple connections between people with different experiences in different communities and that's our story Now we were inspired by the Terminator 2 scene for T-1000 and we thought why couldn't a 3D printer operate in this fashion where you have an object arise out of a puddle in essentially real time with essentially no waste to make a great object Okay just like the movies And could we be inspired by Hollywood and come up with ways to actually try to get this to work And that was our challenge And our approach would be if we could do this then we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3D printing from being a manufacturing process One 3D printing takes forever There are mushrooms that grow faster than 3D printed parts The layer by layer process leads to defects in mechanical properties and if we could grow continuously we could eliminate those defects And in fact if we could grow really fast we could also start using materials that are self-curing and we could have amazing properties So if we could pull this off imitate Hollywood we could in fact address 3D manufacturing Our approach is to use some standard knowledge in polymer chemistry to harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously Light and oxygen work in different ways Light can take a resin and convert it to a solid can convert a liquid to a solid Oxygen inhibits that process So light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another from a chemical point of view and if we can control spatially the light and oxygen we could control this process And we refer to this as CLIP Continuous Liquid Interface Production It has three functional components One it has a reservoir that holds the puddle just like the T-1000 At the bottom of the reservoir is a special window I'll come back to that In addition it has a stage that will lower into the puddle and pull the object out of the liquid The third component is a digital light projection system underneath the reservoir illuminating with light in the ultraviolet region Now the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir it's a composite it's a very special window It's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen It's got characteristics like a contact lens So we can see how the process works You can start to see that as you lower a stage in there in a traditional process with an oxygen-impermeable window you make a two-dimensional pattern and you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window and so in order to introduce the next layer you have to separate it introduce new resin reposition it and do this process over and over again But with our very special window what we're able to do is with oxygen coming through the bottom as light hits it that oxygen inhibits the reaction and we form a dead zone This dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick so that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell right at the window interface that remains a liquid and we pull this object up and as we talked about in a Science paper as we change the oxygen content we can change the dead zone thickness And so we have a number of key variables that we control: oxygen content the light the light intensity the dose to cure the viscosity the geometry and we use very sophisticated software to control this process The result is pretty staggering It's 25 to 100 times faster than traditional 3D printers which is game-changing In addition as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface we can go 1，000 times faster I believe and that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat and as a chemical engineer I get very excited at heat transfer and the idea that we might one day have water-cooled 3D printers because they're going so fast In addition because we're growing things we eliminate the layers and the parts are monolithic You don't see the surface structure You have molecularly smooth surfaces And the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3D printer are notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation with which how you printed it because of the layer-like structure But when you grow objects like this the properties are invariant with the print direction These look like injection-molded parts which is very different than traditional 3D manufacturing In addition we're able to throw the entire polymer chemistry textbook at this and we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties you really want in a 3D-printed object There it is That's great You always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage right But we can have materials with great mechanical properties For the first time we can have elastomers that are high elasticity or high dampening Think about vibration control or great sneakers for example We can make materials that have incredible strength high strength-to-weight ratio really strong materials really great elastomers so throw that in the audience there So great material properties And so the opportunity now if you actually make a part that has the properties to be a final part and you do it in game-changing speeds you can actually transform manufacturing Right now in manufacturing what happens is the so-called digital thread in digital manufacturing We go from a CAD drawing a design to a prototype to manufacturing Often the digital thread is broken right at prototype because you can't go all the way to manufacturing because most parts don't have the properties to be a final part We now can connect the digital thread all the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing and that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things from better fuel-efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties with high strength-to-weight ratio new turbine blades all sorts of wonderful things Think about if you need a stent in an emergency situation instead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf that was just standard sizes having a stent that's designed for you for your own anatomy with your own tributaries printed in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties such that the stent could go away after 18 months: really-game changing Or digital dentistry and making these kinds of structures even while you're in the dentist chair And look at the structures that my students are making at the University of North Carolina These are amazing microscale structures You know the world is really good at nano-fabrication Moore's Law has driven things from 10 microns and below We're really good at that but it's actually very hard to make things from 10 microns to 1，000 microns the mesoscale And subtractive techniques from the silicon industry can't do that very well They can't etch wafers that well But this process is so gentle we can grow these objects up from the bottom using additive manufacturing and make amazing things in tens of seconds opening up new sensor technologies new drug delivery techniques new lab-on-a-chip applications really game-changing stuff So the opportunity of making a part in real time that has the properties to be a final part really opens up 3D manufacturing and for us this is very exciting because this really is owning the intersection between hardware software and molecular science and I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world are going to be able to do with this great tool Thanks for listening How many people here have heard of PMS Everybody right Everyone knows that women go a little crazy right before they get their period that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster of irrationality and irritability There's a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions and that the great majority of women are affected by this Well I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says neither of those assumptions is true I'm here to give you the good news about PMS But first let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS is entrenched in American culture If you examine newspaper or magazine articles you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS In an article in the magazine Redbook titled You: PMS Free readers were informed that between 80 to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS L。A Muscle magazine warned its readers that 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from PMS and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health and a couple of years ago even the Wall Street Journal ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS asking its female readers Do you turn into a witch every month From all these articles you would think there must be a mountain of research verifying the widespread nature of PMS However after five decades of research there's no strong consensus on the definition the cause the treatment or even the existence of PMS As most commonly defined by psychologists PMS involves negative behavioral cognitive and physical symptoms from the time of ovulation to menstruation But here's where it gets tricky Over 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS and here are just a few of those Now I want to be clear here I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms doesn't amount to a mental disorder and when psychologists come up with a disorder that's so vaguely defined the label eventually becomes meaningless With a list of symptoms this long and wide I could have PMS you could have PMS the guy in the third row here could have PMS my dog could have PMS Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms Some said three Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful if they were highly disturbing to you but others said minor symptoms were just as important For many years because there was no standardization in the definition of PMS when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates their estimates ranged from five percent of women to 97 percent of women so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS Overall the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable First many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively looking to the past and relying on memory which is known to inflate reporting of PMS compared to what's called prospective reporting which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms for at least two months in a row Many studies also exclusively focused on white middle-class women which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations Third many studies failed to use control groups If we want to understand the specific characteristics of women who have PMS we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS And finally many different types of questionnaires were used to diagnose PMS focusing on different symptoms symptom duration and severity To do reliable research on any condition scientists must agree on the specific characteristics that make up that condition so they're all talking about the same thing and with PMS this has not been the case However in 1994 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders known as the DSM thankfully -- it's also the manual for mental health professionals -- Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease And according to these new DSM guidelines in most menstrual cycles in the last year at least five of 11 possible symptoms must appear in the week before menstruation starts; the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun; and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended One of these symptoms must come from this list of four: marked mood swings irritability anxiety or depression The other symptoms could come from the first slide or from those on the second slide including symptoms like feeling out of control and changes in sleep or appetite The DSM also required now that the symptoms should be associated with clinically significant distress -- there should be some kind of disturbance in work or school or social relationships -- and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row And finally the DSM required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder So scientifically speaking this is an improvement We now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning that's required and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific Well using this criteria and looking at most recent studies we see that on average three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD Not all women not most women not the majority of women not even a lot of women: three to eight percent For everyone else variables like stressful events or happy occasions or even day of the week are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month and this is the information the scientific community has had since the 1990s In 2002 my colleagues and I published an article describing the PMS and PMDD research and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals The questions is why hasn't this information trickled down to the public Why do these myths persist Well certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive from books TV movies the Internet that everyone gets PMS go a long way in convincing them it must be true Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it Let me tell you what I mean by erroneously You might ask her Do you have PMS and she says yes but then when you have her keep a daily log of psychological symptoms for two months no correlation is found between her symptoms and time of the month Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler have suggested that taking on the label of PMS allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike is one who is happy loving caring for others and taking great satisfaction from that role Well PMS has become a permission slip to be angry complain be irritated without losing the title of good woman We know that the variables in a woman's environment are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones but when she attributes anger to hormones she's absolved of responsibility or criticism Oh that's not who she is It's out of her control And while this can be a useful tool it serves to invalidate women's emotions When people respond to a woman's anger with the thought Oh it's just that time of the month her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited So who else benefits from the myth of PMS Well I can tell you that treating PMS has become a profitable thriving industry Amazon。com currently offers over 1，900 books on PMS treatment A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia of clinics workshops and seminars Reputable Internet sources of medical information like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder It's not a known disorder but they list it And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it like anti-depressants or hormones Interestingly though both websites say that the success of medication in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman Well that doesn't make sense If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause which PMS is supposed to be then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women This has not been the case with these treatments and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective a large portion of the target population should see clinically significant improvement So we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments However the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that PMS is a common mental disorder and is treatable is quite substantial When women are prescribed drugs like anti-depressants or hormones medical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months That's a lot of doctor visits Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication for all of their child-bearing lives Over-the-counter drugs like Midol even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability even though they only contain a diuretic a pain reliever and caffeine Now far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine but I don't think reducing tension is one of them Since 2002 Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents They are aiming at young girls early to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster but wait there's something you can do about it: Take Midol and you will be a human being again In 2013 Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women First it contributes to the medicalization of women's reproductive health The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment and this has come at many costs including excessive Cesarean deliveries hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health Second the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women as irrational and overemotional When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster that turns women into angry beasts it becomes easy to question the competence of all women Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons of fields like government or business and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator someone who has qualities like rationality steadiness competence come to mind and in our culture that sounds more like a man than a woman and the PMS myth contributes to that Psychologists know that the moods of men and women are more similar than different One study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood swings they experienced and the severity of those mood swings were no different And finally the PMS myth keeps women from dealing with the actual issues causing them emotional upset Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty are all strongly related to daily mood Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them So the good news about PMS is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle the great majority don't get a mental disorder They go to work or school take care of their families and function at a normal level We know the emotions and moods of men and women are more similar than different so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning the great majority of women live every day Thank you I cannot forget them Their names were Aslan Alik Andrei and the list is longer For many their existence their humanity has been reduced to statistics coldly recorded as security incidents For me they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '90s They were nurses logisticians shelter experts paralegals interpreters And for this service they were murdered their families torn apart and their story largely forgotten No one was ever sentenced for these crimes I cannot forget them They live in me somehow their memories giving me meaning every day But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind As humanitarian aid workers they made the choice to be at the side of the victim to provide some assistance some comfort some protection but when they needed protection themselves it wasn't there When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria -- aid worker abducted hostage executed -- but who were they Why were they there What motivated them How did we become so indifferent to these crimes This is why I am here today with you We need to find better ways to remember them We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives We also need to demand justice When in '96 I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus I knew some of the risks Five colleagues had been killed three had been seriously injured seven had already been taken hostage So we were careful We were using armored vehicles decoy cars changing patterns of travel changing homes all sorts of security measures Yet on a cold winter night of January '98 it was my turn When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard we were surrounded by armed men They took the guard they put him on the floor they beat him up in front of me tied him dragged him away I was handcuffed blindfolded and forced to kneel as the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck When it happens to you there is no time for thinking no time for praying My brain went on automatic rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me but that someone somewhere had ordered my kidnapping Then a process of dehumanization started that day I was no more than just a commodity I normally don't talk about this but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those 317 days of captivity I was kept in an underground cellar total darkness for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day and then the guards would come normally two They would bring a big piece of bread a bowl of soup and a candle That candle would burn for 15 minutes 15 minutes of precious light and then they would take it away and I returned to darkness I was chained by a metal cable to my bed I could do only four small steps I always dreamt of the fifth one And no TV no radio no newspaper no one to talk to I had no towel no soap no toilet paper just two metal buckets open one for water for one waste Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk We are breaking my nerves very slowly Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe How do you describe nothing There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached in that very thin border between sanity and madness In the darkness sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers I would start with the black play with the white back to the black trying to trick the other side I don't play checkers anymore I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague the guard Edik I didn't know what had happened to him I was trying not to think I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot I tried to pray I tried all sorts of memorization games But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal One part of your brain wants you to resist to shout to cry and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it It's a constant internal debate; there is no one to arbitrate Once a guard came to me very aggressively and he told me Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food I wasn't in a good mood so I insulted him I insulted his mother I insulted his ancestors The consequence was moderate: he threw the food into my waste The day after he came back with the same demand He got the same answer which had the same consequence Four days later the body was full of pain I didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little So when the guards came down I knelt I begged for my food Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle After my kidnapping I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars and upon arrival I was interrogated for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan The routine was always the same: a bit more light 45 minutes He would come down to the cellar he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair and he would turn on the music loud And then he would yell questions He would scream He would beat me I'll spare you the details There are many questions I could not understand and there are some questions I did not want to understand The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape: 15 songs 45 minutes I would always long for the last song On one day one night in that cellar I don't know what it was I heard a child crying above my head a boy maybe two or three years old Footsteps confusion people running So when Ruslan came the day after before he put the first question to me I asked him How is your son today Is he feeling better Ruslan was taken by surprise He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better And we talked about education we talked about families He talked to me about his children I talked to him about my daughters And then he'd talk about guns about cars about women and I had to talk about guns about cars about women And we talked until the last song on the tape Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met He did not touch me anymore He did not ask any other questions I was no longer just a commodity Two days after I was transferred to another place There a guard came to me very close -- it was quite unusual -- and he said with a very soft voice he said I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan What could I possibly reply It was so painful It was like a blade in the belly It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier of fortune he became He was young he was shy I never saw his face He probably meant well But in those 15 seconds he made me question everything we did all the sacrifices He made me think also how they see us Until then I had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing One cannot assume this Well explaining why we do this is not that easy even to our closest relatives We are not perfect we are not superior we are not the world's fire brigade we are not superheroes we don't stop wars we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution Yet we do this because one life matters Sometimes that's the only difference you make -- one individual one family a small group of individuals -- and it matters When you have a tsunami an earthquake or a typhoon you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world searching for survivors for weeks Why Nobody questions this Every life matters or every life should matter This is the same for us when we help refugees people displaced within their country by conflict or stateless persons I know many people when they are confronted by overwhelming suffering they feel powerless and they stop there It's a pity because there are so many ways people can help We don't stop with that feeling We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance some protection some comfort We have to We can't do otherwise It's what makes us feel I don't know simply human That's a picture of me the day of my release Months after my release I met the then-French prime minister The second thing he told me: You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus You don't know how many problems you've created for us It was a short meeting I think helping people in danger is responsible In that war that nobody seriously wanted to stop and we have many of these today bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity it was making a real difference for the people Why could he not understand this We have a responsibility to try You've heard about that concept: Responsibility to Protect Outcomes may depend on various parameters We may even fail but there is worse than failing -- it's not even trying when we can Well if you are met this way if you sign up for this sort of job your life is going to be full of joy and sadness because there are a lot of people we cannot help a lot of people we cannot protect a lot of people we did not save I call them my ghost and by having witnessed their suffering from close you take a bit of that suffering on yourself Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness They are thrown into situations where they are witness but they are powerless to bring any change They have to learn to accept it and gradually turn this into positive energy It's difficult Many don't succeed but for those who do there is no other job like this You can see the difference you make every day Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or in post-conflict environments yet our life our job is becoming increasingly life-threatening and the sanctity of our life is fading Do you know that since the millennium the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled 2013 broke new records: 155 colleagues killed 171 seriously wounded 134 abducted So many broken lives Until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '80s humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages but by and large we were not the target of these attacks This has changed Look at this picture Baghdad August 2003: 24 colleagues were killed Gone are the days when a U。N blue flag or a Red Cross would automatically protect us Criminal groups and some political groups have cross-fertilized over the last 20 years and they've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating Humanitarian principles are tested questioned and often ignored but perhaps more importantly we have abandoned the search for justice There seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian aid workers After my release I was told not to seek any form of justice It won't do you any good that's what I was told Plus you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues It took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated with my kidnapping but this was the exception There was no justice for any of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between '95 and '99 and it's the same all over the world This is unacceptable This is inexcusable Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law Those crimes should not go unpunished We must end this cycle of impunity We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself That makes me furious I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for I don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages Four days before my eventful release four hostages were beheaded a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity Why them Why am I here today No easy answer I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives from colleagues from friends from people I didn't know They have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness Not everyone was treated with the same attention How many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident took their own life I can count nine that I knew personally How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse I've lost that count There is a price for this type of life In Russia all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top It says No one is forgotten nothing is forgotten I do not forget my lost colleagues I cannot forget anything I call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off After my ordeal a lot of colleagues asked me But why do you continue Why do you do this sort of job Why do you have to go back to it My answer was very simple: If I had quit that would have meant my kidnapper had won They would have taken my soul and my humanity Thank you I have a confession to make I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead But recently I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation I'm an ethnographer I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested So along with three co-conspirators I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation We studied 16 men and women located in seven countries across the globe working in 12 different industries In total we spent hundreds of hours on the ground on-site watching these leaders in action We ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did The bottom line If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership Leading innovation is not about creating a vision and inspiring others to execute it But what do we mean by innovation An innovation is anything that is both new and useful It can be a product or service It can be a process or a way of organizing It can be incremental or it can be breakthrough We have a pretty inclusive definition How many of you recognize this man Put your hands up Keep your hands up if you know who this is How about these familiar faces From your show of hands it looks like many of you have seen a Pixar movie but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull the founder and CEO of Pixar -- one of the companies I had the privilege of studying My first visit to Pixar was in 2005 when they were working on Ratatouille that provocative movie about a rat becoming a master chef Computer-generated movies are really mainstream today but it took Ed and his colleagues nearly 20 years to create the first full-length C。G movie In the 20 years hence they've produced 14 movies I was recently at Pixar and I'm here to tell you that number 15 is sure to be a winner When many of us think about innovation though we think about an Einstein having an 'Aha！' moment But we all know that's a myth Innovation is not about solo genius it's about collective genius Let's think for a minute about what it takes to make a Pixar movie: No solo genius no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies On the contrary it takes about 250 people four to five years to make one of those movies To help us understand the process an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture He did so reluctantly because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups Even with all those arrows he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative interrelated and frankly messy their process was Throughout the making of a movie at Pixar the story evolves So think about it Some shots go through quickly They don't all go through in order It depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene So if you think about that scene in Up where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird that 10 seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect The other thing about a Pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps Partway through one production an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side When the director saw that drawing he thought it was great It was beautiful but he said You've got to lose it; it doesn't fit the character Two weeks later the director came back and said Let's put in those few seconds of film Because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story What we know is at the heart of innovation is a paradox You have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness them into a work that is actually useful Innovation is a journey It's a type of collaborative problem solving usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view Innovations rarely get created full-blown As many of you know they're the result usually of trial and error Lots of false starts missteps and mistakes Innovative work can be very exhilarating but it also can be really downright scary So when we look at why it is that Pixar is able to do what it does we have to ask ourselves what's going on here For sure history and certainly Hollywood is full of star-studded teams that have failed Most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks if you will in the kitchen So why is it that Pixar with all of its cooks is able to be so successful time and time again When we studied an Islamic Bank in Dubai or a luxury brand in Korea or a social enterprise in Africa we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities: creative abrasion creative agility and creative resolution Creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse In innovative organizations they amplify differences they don't minimize them Creative abrasion is not about brainstorming where people suspend their judgment No they know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives Individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire they learn how to actively listen but guess what They also learn how to advocate for their point of view They understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit reflection and adjustment It's about discovery-driven learning where you act as opposed to plan your way to the future It's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process It's about running a series of experiments and not a series of pilots Experiments are usually about learning When you get a negative outcome you're still really learning something that you need to know Pilots are often about being right When they don't work someone or something is to blame The final capability is creative resolution This is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations to produce a solution that is new and useful When you look at innovative organizations they never go along to get along They don't compromise They don't let one group or one individual dominate even if it's the boss even if it's the expert Instead they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both/and solutions to arise and not simply either/or solutions These three capabilities are why we see that Pixar is able to do what it does Let me give you another example and that example is the infrastructure group of Google The infrastructure group of Google is the group that has to keep the website up and running 24/7 So when Google was about to introduce Gmail and YouTube they knew that their data storage system wasn't adequate The head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named Bill Coughran Bill and his leadership team who he referred to as his brain trust had to figure out what to do about this situation They thought about it for a while Instead of creating a group to tackle this task they decided to allow groups to emerge spontaneously around different alternatives Two groups coalesced the other became known as Build It From Scratch Big Table proposed that they build on the current system Separately these two teams were allowed to work full-time on their particular approach In engineering reviews Bill described his role as Injecting honesty into the process by driving debate Early on the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach When Build It From Scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the middle of the night if something went wrong with the website they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design As the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data or the evidence began to come in it became pretty clear that the Big Table solution was the right one for the moment So they selected that one But to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the Build it From Scratch team Bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next-generation system This whole process took nearly two years but I was told that they were all working at breakneck speed Early in that process one of the engineers had gone to Bill and said We're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments But as the process unfolded he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions He admitted If you had forced us to all be on one team we might have focused on proving who was right and winning and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for Google Why is it that Pixar and Google are able to innovate time and again It's because they've mastered the capabilities required for that They know how to do collaborative problem solving they know how to do discovery-driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making Some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now We don't know how to do those things in my organization So why do they know how to do those things at Pixar and why do they know how to do those things at Google When many of the people that worked for Bill told us in their opinion that Bill was one of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley we completely agreed; the man is a genius Leadership is the secret sauce But it's a different kind of leadership not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership One of the leaders I met with early on said to me Linda I don't read books on leadership All they do is make me feel bad In the first chapter they say I'm supposed to create a vision But if I'm trying to do something that's truly new I have no answers I don't know what direction we're going in and I'm not even sure I know how to figure out how to get there For sure there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed But if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we must recast our understanding of what leadership is about Leading innovation is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving At this point some of you may be wondering What does that leadership really look like At Pixar they understand that innovation takes a village The leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities How do they define leadership They say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong What kind of world do people want to belong in at Pixar A world where you're living at the frontier What do they focus their time on Not on creating a vision Instead they spend their time thinking about How do we design a studio that has the sensibility of a public square so that people will interact Let's put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film What can we do to make sure that all the disruptors all the minority voices in this organization speak up and are heard And finally let's bestow credit in a very generous way I don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a Pixar movie but the babies born during a production are listed there How did Bill think about what his role was Bill said I lead a volunteer organization Talented people don't want to follow me anywhere They want to cocreate with me the future My job is to nurture the bottom-up and not let it degenerate into chaos How did he see his role I'm a role model I'm a human glue I'm a connector I'm an aggregator of viewpoints I'm never a dictator of viewpoints Advice about how you exercise the role Hire people who argue with you And guess what Sometimes it's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague Some of you may be wondering now what are these people thinking They're thinking I'm not the visionary I'm the social architect I'm creating the space where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions If some of you are worrying now that you don't work at a Pixar or you don't work at a Google I want to tell you there's still hope We've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens We studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers 19 competitors to collaborate and innovate We studied the head of marketing at a German automaker where fundamentally they believed that it was the design engineers not the marketeers who were allowed to be innovative We also studied Vineet Nayar at HCL Technologies an Indian outsourcing company When we met Vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant We watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of I。T innovation At HCL technologies like at many companies the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it What he did is tell them it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do Because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation we saw at Pixar or Google So they began to work on that They stopped giving answers they stopped trying to provide solutions Instead what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid the young sparks the people who were closest to the customers as the source of innovation They began to transfer the organization's growth to that level In Vineet's language this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that was happening every day For sure Vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries For sure they understood that that was not their role So I don't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize Ed Because Ed like Vineet understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage not perform on it If we want to invent a better future and I suspect that's why many of us are here then we need to reimagine our task Our task is to create the space where everybody's slices of genius can be unleashed and harnessed and turned into works of collective genius Thank you We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons especially for young inmates New York state is one of only two in the U。S that automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults This culture of violence takes these young people and puts them in a hostile environment and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on There's not really much for these young people to do to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18 we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people I know firsthand Before I ever turned 18 I spent approximately 400 days on Rikers Island and to add to that I spent almost 300 days in solitary confinement and let me tell you this: Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window it gets tiring Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there you start pacing back and forth in your cell you start talking to yourself your thoughts start running wild and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person not cause him or her to become more angry frustrated and feel more hopeless Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people they pretty much reenter society with nothing And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating But it all starts with the C。O。s It's very easy for some people to look at these correctional officers as the good guys and the inmates as the bad guys or vice versa for some but it's a little more than that See these C。O。s are normal everyday people They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they serve They're just normal people They're not robots and there's nothing special about them They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does The male C。O。s want to talk and flirt with the female C。O。s They play the little high school kid games with each other They politic with one another And the female C。O。s gossip to each other So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C。O。s and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation with another young man in my housing unit and he felt since there was a female officer working on the floor that I violated his shift So he punched me in my chest He kind of knocked the wind out of me I wasn't impulsive I didn't react right away because I know this is their house I have no wins All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately So I just gave him a look in his eyes and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning and he said to me Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble because you're looking like you want to fight So he commenced to taking off his utility belt he took off his shirt and his badge and he said We could fight So I asked him You gonna hold it down Now that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody and you're not going to report it He said Yeah I'm gonna hold it down You gonna hold it down I didn't even respond I just punched him right in his face and we began fighting right then and there Towards the end of the fight he slammed me up against the wall so while we were tussled up he said to me You good as if he got the best of me but in my mind I know I got the best of him so I replied very cocky Oh I'm good you good He said Yeah I'm good I'm good We let go he shook my hand said he gave me my respect gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way Believe it or not you come across some C。O。s on Rikers Island that'll fight you one-on-one They feel that they understand how it is and they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes we can handle it in that manner I walk away from it like a man you walk away from it like a man and that's it Some C。O。s feel that they're jailing with you This is why they have that mentality and that attitude and they go by that concept In some instances we're in it together with the C。O。s However institutions need to give these correctional officers proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population and they also need to give them proper trainings on how to deal with the mental health population as well These C。O。s play a big factor in these young people's lives for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change so once they reenter back into society they're doing something positive A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming When I was on Rikers Island the huge thing was solitary confinement Solitary confinement was originally designed to break a person mentally physically and emotionally That's what it was designed for The U。S Attorney General recently released a report stating that they're going to ban solitary confinement in New York state for teens One thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading I tried to educate myself as much as possible I read any and everything I could get my hands on And aside from that I wrote music and short stories Some programs that I feel would benefit our young people are art therapy programs for the kids that like to draw and have that talent and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined How about a music program for them that actually teaches them how to write and make music Just a thought When adolescents come to Rikers Island C74 RNDC is the building that they're housed in That's nicknamed gladiator school because you have a young individual coming in from the street thinking that they're tough being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals from all of the five boroughs and everybody feels that they're tough So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you or I'm tougher than you you and you But let's be honest: That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people We need to help institutions and these teens realize that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led when they were on the street that they can actually make a change It's sad to report that while I was in prison I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison what type of crimes they're going to commit when they get back in the street The conversations used to sound something like this: Oh when I hit the street my brother got this connection for this that and the third or My man over here got this connection for the low price Let's exchange information and When we hit the town we're going to do it real big I used to hear these conversations and think to myself Wow these dudes are really talking about going back in the street and committing future crimes So I came up with a name for that: I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme because really how long is that going to last You get a retirement plan with that Nice little pension 401 403 You get health insurance Dental But I will tell you this: Being in jail and being in prison I came across some of the most intelligent brilliant and talented people that I would ever meet I've seen individuals take a potato chip bag and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame I've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures that would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it At the age of 21 I was in a maximum-security prison called Elmira Correctional Facility I just came out of the weight shack from working out and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard just looking up at the sky Mind you this older gentlemen was serving a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence in which he already had served 20 years of that sentence So I walk up to him and I said O。G。 what's going on man you good He looked at me and he said Yeah I'm good young blood I'm like So what are you looking up at the sky for man What's so fascinating up there He said You look up and you tell me what you see Clouds He said All right What else do you see At that time it was a plane passing by I said All right I see an airplane He said Exactly and what's on that airplane People Exactly Now where's that plane and those people going I don't know You know Please let me know if you do Then let me get some lottery numbers He said You're missing the big picture young blood That plane with those people is going somewhere while we're here stuck The big picture is this: That plane with those people going somewhere that's life passing us by while we behind these walls stuck Ever since that day that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change Growing up I was always a good smart kid Some people would say I was a little too smart for my own good I had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist Currently I'm working at the Fortune Society which is a reentry program and I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism So I connect them with the services that they need once they're released from jail and prison so they can make a positive transition back into society If I was to see my 15-year-old self today I would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him and I would let him know Listen this is me I'm you This is us We are one Everything that you're about to do I know what you're gonna do before you do it because I already did it and I would encourage him not to hang out with x y and z people I would tell him not to be in such-and-such place I would tell him keep your behind in school man because that's where you need to be because that's what's going to get you somewhere in life This is the message that we should be sharing with our young men and young women We shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence that are nearly impossible for them to escape Thank you Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well After one trillion dollars in African development-related aid in the last 60 years real per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s Aid is not doing too well In response the Bretton Woods institutions -- the IMF and the World Bank -- pushed for free trade not aid yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea Yet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98 and built it into a mobile cellular provider with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004 The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition Consider these two alternative scenarios One: You loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market Or two: You give 100，000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs We invested in the second scenario and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers who have an ownership in the business Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim which requires skill financing local and global partnerships and extraordinary perseverance But why pan-African The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 -- where quite frankly we Africans were not exactly consulted -- -- and many sovereign states with small populations: Liberia four million; Cape Verde 500，000 Pan-Africa gives you one billion people granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us The pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria Nigeria Ghana and anywhere else that will buy our food We hope to help solve food security empower farmers create jobs develop the local economy and we hope to become rich in the process While it's not the sexiest approach and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good as giving a woman 100 dollars to buy a goat on kiva。org perhaps supporting fewer higher-impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa can help change this We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world-class businesses creating indigenous wealth providing jobs that we so desperately need and hopefully helping achieve this Africa shall rise Thank you So Sangu of course this is strong rhetoric You're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all Sangu Delle: I think there is a role Microcredit has been a great innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid But for the problems we face in Africa to revitalize war-torn Europe We need more than just microcredit We need more than just give 200 dollars We need to build big businesses and we need jobs Very good Thank you so much About 12 years ago I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place This involved a journey into national and global advocacy and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world In the process I became a civil society diplomat Civil society diplomats do three things: They voice the concerns of the people are not pinned down by national interests and influence change through citizen networks not only state ones And if you want to change the world we need more of them But many people still ask Can civil society really make a big difference Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy I never thought I would ask myself these questions but here I am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society movements that I've been involved in They are in issues that I'm passionate about: gun control and drug policy And these are issues that matter here Latin America is ground zero for both of them For example Brazil -- this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record We are the number one champion in homicidal violence One in every 10 people killed around the world is a Brazilian This translates into over 56，000 people dying violently each year Most of them are young black boys dying by guns Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs and the War on Drugs has been especially painful here Around 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil are related to the War on Drugs The same is true for about 25 percent of people in jail And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs Virtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble Latin America has nine percent of the world's population but 25 percent of its global violent deaths These are not problems we can run away from I certainly could not So the first campaign I got involved with started here in 2003 to change Brazil's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons In just a few years we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history -- -- but we also suffered some setbacks We lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in 2005 The second initiative was also home-grown but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime I am the executive coordinator of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy The commission is a high-level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane and effective approaches to the issue of drugs Since we started in 2008 the taboo on drugs is broken Across the Americas from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay change is in the air But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements I just want to share with you four key insights I call them lessons to change the world There are certainly many more but these are the ones that stand out to me So the first lesson is: Change and control the narrative It may seem obvious but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative This is something that veteran politicians understand but that civil society groups generally do not do very well In the case of drug policy our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting a War on Drugs to putting people's health and safety first In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market are criminal gangs and cartels So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups we need to change the conversation We need to make illegal drugs legal But before I get you too excited I don't mean drugs should be a free-for-all What I'm talking about and what the Global Commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation As for gun control we were successful in changing but not so much in controlling the narrative And this brings me to my next lesson: Never underestimate your opponents If you want to succeed in changing the world you need to know who you're up against You need to learn their motivations and points of view In the case of gun control we really underestimated our opponents After a very successful gun-collection program we were elated We had support from 80 percent of Brazilians and thought that this could help us win the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians But we were dead wrong During a televised 20-day public debate our opponent used our own arguments against us We ended up losing the popular vote It was really terrible The National Rifle Association -- yes the American NRA -- came to Brazil They inundated our campaign with their propaganda that as you know links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy They simply threw everything at us They used our national flag our independence anthem They invoked women's rights and misused images of Mandela Tiananmen Square and even Hitler They won by playing with people's fears In fact guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign Their focus was on individual rights But I ask you which right is more important the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away We thought people would vote in defense of life but in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship the anti-government message of our opponents resonated and we were not prepared to respond Lesson learned We've been more successful in the case of drug policy If you asked most people 10 years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible they would have laughed After all there are huge military police prisons and financial establishments benefiting from this war But today the international drug control regime is starting to crumble Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches really knew its opposition and rather than fighting them our chair -- former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum from liberals to conservatives This high level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies It was this reasoned informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs The War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever and consumption has risen globally But even worse it also generated massive negative unintended consequences It is true that some people have made these arguments before but we've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change Third lesson: Use data to drive your argument Guns and drugs are emotive issues and as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try Until quite recently we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns Amazingly it was a local soap opera called Mulheres Apaixonadas -- or Women in Love -- that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign In one highly viewed episode a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged and in a case of art imitating life this episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here outside in Copacabana Beach The televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion Within weeks our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years We were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program Here is what I mean: We could prove that in just one year we saved more than 5，000 lives And in the case of drugs in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue we managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se and people are starting to get it My fourth insight is: Don't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows What we've learned in Brazil -- and this doesn't only apply to my country -- is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together If you want to change the world it helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side In both the case of guns and drugs we brought together a wonderful mix of people We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media We gathered the victims human rights champions cultural icons We also assembled the professional classes -- doctors lawyers academia and more What I've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change In the case of drugs and liberal politicians They may not agree on everything; in fact they disagree on almost everything But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view Over a decade ago I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy as you can imagine But I took a chance I changed course and on the way I helped to create social movements that I believe have made some parts of the world safer Each and every one of us has the power to change the world No matter what the issue and no matter how hard the fight civil society is central to the blueprint for change Thank you Twenty-five years ago scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web Since then the Internet has transformed the way we communicate the way we do business and even the way we live In many ways the ideas that gave birth to Google Facebook Twitter and so many others have now really transformed our lives and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society However there are also some downsides to this Today the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online and we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook each time we search on Google and each time we send an email Now many of us probably think well one email there's nothing in there right But if you consider a year's worth of emails or maybe even a lifetime of email collectively this tells a lot It tells where we have been who we have met and in many ways even what we're thinking about And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever so your data can and will outlive you What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy So this year as the web turns 25 it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this We have to really think We've lost privacy yes but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself If you think about it most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the Internet but today there's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online and this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private So we keep going down this road 20 years from now the word 'privacy' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and I So it's time for us to take a moment and think is there anything we can do about this And I believe there is Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today: email Before the invention of email we largely communicated using letters and the process was quite simple You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper then you would place it into a sealed envelope and from there you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it Unfortunately today when we actually send an email we're not sending a letter What you are sending in many ways is actually a postcard and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents So the solution to this has been known for some time and there's many attempts to do it The most basic solution is to use encryption and the idea is quite simple First you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server Then you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself But there's a problem with this and that is the email servers also hold the encryption keys so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it But not only that any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data and this is all without you being aware of it So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy in principle: You give everybody their own keys and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys This seems like common sense right So the question that comes up is why hasn't this been done yet Well if we really think about it we see that the business model of the Internet today really isn't compatible with privacy Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web and you see that advertising plays a huge role In fact this year alone advertising is 137 billion dollars and to optimize the ads that are shown to us companies have to know everything about us They need to know where we live how old we are what we like what we don't like and anything else they can get their hands on And if you think about it the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy If we want to have privacy online what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves For many years when it came to email the only solution was something known as PGP which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech-savvy Here's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages So needless to say this is not a solution for everybody and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication by definition it involves having someone to communicate with So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do for the people out there who can't understand how to use it the option to communicate privately simply does not exist And this is a problem that we need to solve So if we want to have privacy online the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry I think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible So last summer when the Edward Snowden story came out several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen At that time we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider which collides protons by the way We were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project: ProtonMail Many startups these days actually begin in people's garages or people's basements We were a bit different We started out at the CERN cafeteria which actually is great because look you have all the food and water you could ever want But even better than this is that every day between 12 p。m and 2 p。m。 free of charge the CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers and these guys basically know the answers to everything So it was in this environment that we began working What we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this but more importantly we want to do it in a way that you can't even tell that it's happened So to do this we actually need a combination of technology and also design So how do we go about doing something like this Well it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer and we don't generate a single key but actually a pair of keys so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key and these keys are mathematically connected So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate So here we have Bob and Alice who want to communicate privately So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer and one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from Alice Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice and because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to Alice and it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key So we've now accomplished the objective which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on Actually what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this And that's actually the key design challenge: How do we take all this complexity all this software and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it I think with ProtonMail we have gotten pretty close to doing this So let's see how it works in practice Here we've got Bob and Alice again who also want to communicate securely They simply create accounts on ProtonMail which is quite simple and takes a few moments and all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as Bob is creating his account Once his account is created he just clicks compose and now he can write his email like he does today So he fills in his information and then after that all he has to do is click send and just like that without understanding cryptography and without doing anything different from how he writes email today Bob has just sent an encrypted message What we have here is really just the first step but it shows that with improving technology privacy doesn't have to be difficult it doesn't have to be disruptive If we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data we can actually make it accessible Now I know a question on everybody's minds is okay protecting privacy this is a great goal but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you And I think the answer is actually yes because today we've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is and when you have that anything is possible Earlier this year ProtonMail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources and when this happened our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal We can also leverage the world Right now we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for ProtonMail and these people come from everywhere and this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue it's a global issue that impacts all of us It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward So what do we have to do to solve this problem Well first of all we need to support a different business model for the Internet one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth We actually need to build a new Internet where our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost But even more importantly we have to build an Internet where privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default We have done the first step with ProtonMail but this is really just the first step in a very very long journey The good news I can share with you guys today the exciting news is that we're not traveling alone The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum and today there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications also our file storage our online search our online browsing and many other things And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising but they've found support really from the people from private individuals like you and I from all over the world This really matters because ultimately privacy depends on each and every one of us and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros It's actually a lot more than that It's our lives our personal stories our friends our families and in many ways also our hopes and our aspirations We need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this only with people that we want to share this with because without this we simply can't have a free society So now's the time for us to collectively stand up and say yes we do want to live in a world with online privacy and yes we can work together to turn this vision into a reality Thank you In the summer of 2011 as a tourist I visited the rainforests of Borneo for the very first time and as you might imagine it was the overwhelming sounds of the forest that struck me the most There's this constant cacophony of noise Some things actually do stick out For example this here is a big bird a rhinoceros hornbill This buzzing is a cicada This is a family of gibbons It's actually singing to each other over a great distance The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve which is why you can hear so many of them but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time was one that I didn't notice and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it So as I said this was a gibbon reserve They spend most of their time rehabilitating gibbons but they also have to spend a lot of their time protecting their area from illegal logging that takes place on the side And so if we take the sound of the forest and we actually turn down the gibbons the insects and the rest in the background the entire time in recordings you heard was the sound of a chainsaw at great distance They had three full-time guards who were posted around this sanctuary whose job was in fact to guard against illegal logging and one day we went walking again as tourists out into the forest and within five minutes' walk we stumbled upon somebody who was just sawing a tree down five minutes' walk a few hundred meters from the ranger station They hadn't been able to hear the chainsaws because as you heard the forest is very very loud It struck me as quite unacceptable that in this modern time just a few hundred meters away from a ranger station in a sanctuary that in fact nobody could hear it when someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up It sounds impossible but in fact it was quite true So how do we stop illegal logging It's really tempting as an engineer always to come up with a high-tech super-crazy high-tech solution but in fact you're in the rainforest It has to be simple it has to be scalable and so what we also noticed while were there was that everything we needed was already there We could build a system that would allow us to stop this using what's already there Who was there What was already in the forest Well we had people We had this group there that was dedicated three full-time guards that was dedicated to go and stop it but they just needed to know what was happening out in the forest The real surprise this is the big one was that there was connectivity out in the forest There was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere We're talking hundreds of kilometers from the nearest road there's certainly no electricity but they had very good cell phone service these people in the towns were on Facebook all the time they're surfing the web on their phones and this sort of got me thinking that in fact it would be possible to use the sounds of the forest pick up the sounds of chainsaws programmatically because people can't hear them and send an alert But you have to have a device to go up in the trees So if we can use some device to listen to the sounds of the forest connect to the cell phone network that's there and send an alert to people on the ground perhaps we could have a solution to this issue for them But let's take a moment to talk about saving the rainforest because it's something that we've definitely all heard about forever People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids and it seems that the message has never changed: We've got to save the rainforest it's super urgent this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday and yet here we are today about half of the rainforest remains and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change But in fact this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time: Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes trains cars trucks and ships combined It's the second highest contributor to climate change Also according to Interpol as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging like the illegal logging that we saw So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there then in fact we could eat heavily into this 17 percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term It might just be the cheapest fastest way to fight climate change And so here's the system that we imagine It looks super high tech The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging It's no more about going out and finding a tree that's been cut It's not about seeing a tree from a satellite in an area that's been clear cut it's about real-time intervention So I said it was the cheapest and fastest way to do it but in fact actually as you saw they weren't able to do it so it may not be so cheap and fast But if the devices in the trees were actually cell phones it could be pretty cheap Cell phones are thrown away by the hundreds of millions every year hundreds of millions in the U。S alone not counting the rest of the world which of course we should do but in fact cell phones are great They're full of sensors They can listen to the sounds of the forest We do have to protect them We have to put them in this box that you see here and we do have to power them Powering them is one of the greater engineering challenges that we had to deal with because powering a cell phone under a tree canopy any sort of solar power under a tree canopy was an as-yet-unsolved problem and that's this unique solar panel design that you see here which in fact is built also from recycled byproducts of an industrial process These are strips that are cut down So this is me putting it all together in my parents' garage actually Thanks very much to them for allowing me to do that As you can see this is a device up in a tree What you can see from here perhaps is that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance That's important because although they are able to hear chainsaw noises up to a kilometer in the distance allowing them to cover about three square kilometers if someone were to take them it would make the area unprotected So does it actually work Well to test it we took it back to Indonesia not the same place but another place to another gibbon reserve that was threatened daily by illegal logging On the very second day it picked up illegal chainsaw noises We were able to get a real-time alert I got an email on my phone Actually we had just climbed the tree Everyone had just gotten back down All these guys are smoking cigarettes and then I get an email and they all quiet down and in fact you can hear the chainsaw really really faint in the background but no one had noticed it until that moment And so then we took off to actually stop these loggers I was pretty nervous This is the moment where we've actually arrived close to where the loggers are This is the moment where you can see where I'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor I'm not really sure what's on the other side of this hill That guy's much braver than I am But he went so I had to go walking up and in fact he made it over the hill and interrupted the loggers in the act For them it was such a surprise -- they had never ever been interrupted before -- that it was such an impressive event for them that we've heard from our partners they have not been back since They were in fact great guys They showed us how the entire operation works and what they really convinced us on the spot was that if you can show up in real time and stop people it's enough of a deterrent they won't come back So -- Thank you Word of this spread possibly because we told a lot of people and in fact then some really amazing stuff started to happen People from around the world started to send us emails phone calls What we saw was that people throughout Asia people throughout Africa people throughout South America they told us that they could use it too and what's most important what we'd found that we thought might be exceptional in the forest there was pretty good cell phone service That was not exceptional we were told and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat And then something really amazing happened which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground people who are already there who can both improve and use the existing connectivity and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife so to speak And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device So again this didn't come because of any sort of high-tech solution It just came from using what's already there and I'm thoroughly convinced that if it's not phones that there's always going to be enough there that you can build similar solutions that can be very effective in new contexts Thank you very much As a software developer and technologist over the years Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good using technology to solve humanitarian problems This is in 2010 in Uganda working on a solution that allowed local populations to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones for expressing dissent That same technology was deployed later in North Africa for similar purposes to help activists stay connected when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity as a means of population control But over the years as I have thought about these technologies and the things that I work on a question kind of nags in the back of my mind which is what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology and if it sometimes actively hurts the communities that we're intending to help The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions that if we build great things it will positively affect everyone Eventually these innovations will get out and find everyone But that's not always the case I like to call this blind championing of technology trickle-down techonomics to borrow a phrase We tend to think that if we design things for the select few eventually those technologies will reach everyone and that's not always the case Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps there's a big movement to track people's personal health with applications that track the number of calories that you burn or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient and in turn these medical facilities are starting to expect these types of efficiencies As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms and they become digitally ready what happens to the digitally invisible What does the medical experience look like for someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch tracking their every movement Do they now become a burden on the medical system Is their experience changed In the world of finance Bitcoin and crypto-currencies are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world but the challenge with these technologies is the barrier to entry is incredibly high right You need access to the same phones devices connectivity and even where you don't where you can find a proxy agent usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate And so the question that I ask myself is what happens to the last community using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia: I recently went to the public library there and they are facing an existential crisis Public funding is dwindling they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant and so one of the ways they're going about this is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud This is great for most kids Right You can check out books from home you can research on the way to school or from school but these are really two big assumptions that one you have access at home and two that you have access to a mobile phone and in Philadelphia many kids do not So what does their education experience look like in the wake of a completely cloud-based library what used to be considered such a basic part of education How do they stay competitive A final example from across the world in East Africa: there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights for a number of reasons Migrant communities older generations dying off and ultimately poor record-keeping have led to conflicts over who owns what And so there was a big movement to put all this information online to track all the ownership of these plots of land put them in the cloud and give them to the communities But actually the unintended consequence of this has been that venture capitalists investors real estate developers have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land right out from under these communities because they have access to the technologies and the connectivity that makes that possible So that's the common thread that connects these examples the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make As engineers as technologists we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing This needs to change We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live In the late '90s there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking I think in 2014 we're long overdue for a similar movement in the area of tech and technology So I just encourage you as you are all thinking about the next big thing as entrepreneurs as CEOs as engineers as makers that you think about the unintended consequences because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone Thank you I'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap It's called Sturgeon's law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad I have a giraffe here I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing Sir you caught the giraffe I have a playing card in my hand Freely name any card in the deck Audience member: 10 of hearts Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts You could have named any card in the deck but you said the 10 of hearts Ninety percent of everything is crap so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct Sir this is not your show Keep the giraffe for a moment okay Jesus Crazy people Well the truth is why is the majority of everything bad And my answer is: I think we stop thinking too soon I'll give you a clear little example something that people used to do around the turn of the century -- not this century the other one The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand in my case the left hand Something that would look like this By the way you reacted I can see your lack of interest But that's okay I understand why We stop thinking too soon But if we give it a little bit more thought like a paper clip A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting Not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers I use my hand closed into a fist that makes this even a little bit more interesting Not only that but I will impose myself a time limit of one second something that would look like this Now -- no no no Sturgeon may be correct But he doesn't have to be correct forever Things can always change Sir what was the card The 10 of hearts There's this to prove that things can always change -- the 10 of hearts Secrets are important And secrets are valuable And this is the best secret I've ever experienced It starts with a deck of cards onto the table an old man and a claim I will not touch the deck till the end It doesn't matter who the man was all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head: I will not touch the deck till the end Now during all this time he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before I will not touch the deck till the end Now sir you have the giraffe Go ahead throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random Perfect Sir you're going to play my role in this story The old man turned to me and he said You could pick a red card or a black card My answer was 。。 Audience member 2: The black card HG: Indeed It was a black card He said It could be a club or a spade and my answer was 。。 Audience member 2: Spade HG: Indeed It was a spade He said It could be a high spade or a low spade And my answer was 。。 Audience member 2: A high spade HG: Indeed It was a high spade Since it's a high spade it could be a nine a 10 a jack king queen or the ace of spades And my answer was 。。 Audience member 2: The king HG: The king of spades indeed Now sir let's be fair You selected black you selected spade you selected the high spade and you selected -- sorry Audience member 2: King HG: King of spades Did you feel I influenced you in any decision Audience member 2: No I just felt your energy HG: But it was a free choice correct Because if not we could start all over again But it was really fair Audience member 2: Absolutely HG: Now the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question a number between one and 52 And the first number I thought of was 。。 Audience member 2: 17 HG: Indeed It was the 17 The old man only said one more thing: This is the end And I knew exactly what that meant I knew that he was going to touch the deck Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked He took the deck out of the box Nothing in the box He counted One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 The tension was building 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 And on the 17 instead of the king of spades something appeared in the middle of the deck that later I would realize was actually a secret The old man stood up he left I never saw him again But he left his notebook that was there from the beginning And when I picked it up that was the best secret I've ever experienced We are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share And this was his way of sharing a secret with me Crazy shit Now -- I believe that amazing things happen all the time I really do And the reason why we don't see them as often it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things But what if we decided to search for those amazing things for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing So you have the giraffe go ahead throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random Sir I'm going to ask you do you have with you a United States $1 bill Audience member 3: I think so HG: Yes You see a coincidence Let's make sure you have it Do you have it Audience member 3: Yes HG: Yes Perfect Now I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do I have a dollar bill here to explain I want you to take the dollar bill and fold the Washington part inside like this So you get this kind of big square okay Now I want you to take the bill and fold it like this lengthwise so it becomes like a rectangle and then again -- really fold it really crease it -- and when you have it please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it Do you have it Perfect Now I'm going to approach and before we start I want to make sure that we do this in very very serious conditions First of all I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip First of all take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill And this is the reason why: later I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think oh while I was distracted by Helder someone came onstage and swapped the bill So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill Now not only that I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see Is that fair Now you can give me the marker back And just like that very clearly I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it we're going to actually have a camera man onstage Yes perfect so that you can see That's your signature Yes Perfect Now we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this And we're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence Do you mind can you help me with this Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle And do you mind can you take some cards and shuffle You can take some cards and shuffle You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways You can shuffle cards like this You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way something like this You can shuffle cards in the American way As a Portuguese I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it But the important part is after shuffling the cards always remember to cut and complete the cards Do you mind doing that for me sir Please cut and complete And when you have it place the cards up in the air And you too cut and complete and up in the air Up in the air A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one two three four and five people Now very clearly I'm going to gather the deck together And just like that I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone I'm going to try I have some cards that maybe maybe they don't mean anything But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention Because maybe maybe they mean a lot Before we start sir you gave me a dollar bill Is that your signature Audience member 3: Yes it is HG: I want you to see very clearly that I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number Madam can you take the dollar bill In the serial number there is a letter What is the first number after the letter Audience member 4: Seven HG: Seven Seven But that's maybe just one coincidence What is the second number Audience member 4: Nine And after the nine Audience member 4: Two HG: The two And after the two Audience member 4: Three HG: Three and after Audience member 4: Three HG: Three Audience member 4: Seven HG: Seven Audience member 4: Four HG: Four Audience member 4: Two HG: Two and Audience member 4: Q HG: Q like in queen The queen of clubs All the cards in order just for you And that's my show Thank you very much and have a nice night What's the fastest growing threat to Americans' health Cancer Heart attacks Diabetes The answer is actually none of these; it's Alzheimer's disease Every 67 seconds someone in the United States is diagnosed with Alzheimer's As the number of Alzheimer's patients triples by the year 2050 caring for them as well as the rest of the aging population will become an overwhelming societal challenge My family has experienced firsthand the struggles of caring for an Alzheimer's patient Growing up in a family with three generations I've always been very close to my grandfather When I was four years old my grandfather and I were walking in a park in Japan when he suddenly got lost and it was also the first instance that informed us that my grandfather had Alzheimer's disease Over the past 12 years his condition got worse and worse and his wandering in particular caused my family a lot of stress My aunt his primary caregiver really struggled to stay awake at night to keep an eye on him and even then often failed to catch him leaving the bed I became really concerned about my aunt's well-being as well as my grandfather's safety I searched extensively for a solution that could help my family's problems but couldn't find one Then one night about two years ago I was looking after my grandfather and I saw him stepping out of the bed The moment his foot landed on the floor I thought why don't I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot Once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then wirelessly send an audible alert to the caregiver's smartphone That way my aunt could sleep much better at night without having to worry about my grandfather's wandering So now I'd like to perform a demonstration of this sock Could I please have my sock model on the stage Great So once the patient steps onto the floor -- -- an alert is sent to the caregiver's smartphone Thank you Thank you sock model So this is a drawing of my preliminary design My desire to create a sensor-based technology perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love for sensors and technology When I was six years old an elderly family friend fell down in the bathroom and suffered severe injuries I became concerned about my own grandparents and decided to invent a smart bathroom system Motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they fell down in the bathroom Since I was only six years old at the time and I hadn't graduated from kindergarten yet I didn't have the necessary resources and tools to translate my idea into reality but nonetheless my research experience really implanted in me a firm desire to use sensors to help the elderly people I really believe that sensors can improve the quality of life of the elderly When I laid out my plan I realized that I faced three main challenges: first creating a sensor; second designing a circuit; and third coding a smartphone app This made me realize that my project was actually much harder to realize than I initially had thought it to be First I had to create a wearable sensor that was thin and flexible enough to be worn comfortably on the bottom of the patient's foot After extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber which I realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot I decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles Once pressure is applied the connectivity between the particles increases Therefore I could design a circuit that would measure pressure by measuring electrical resistance Next I had to design a wearable wireless circuit but wireless signal transmission consumes lots of power and requires heavy bulky batteries Thankfully I was able to find out about the Bluetooth low energy technology which consumes very little power and can be driven by a coin-sized battery This prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night Lastly I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care-giver's smartphone into a remote monitor For this I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks Integrating these components I was able to successfully create two prototypes one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock and another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now and it's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering Last summer I was able to beta test my device at several residential care facilities in California and I'm currently incorporating the feedback to further improve the device into a marketable product Testing the device on a number of patients made me realize that I needed to invent solutions for people who didn't want to wear socks to sleep at night So sensor data collected on a vast number of patients can be useful for improving patient care and also leading to a cure for the disease possibly For example I'm currently examining correlations between the frequency of a patient's nightly wandering and his or her daily activities and diet One thing I'll never forget is when my device first caught my grandfather's wandering out of bed at night At that moment I was really struck by the power of technology to change lives for the better People living happily and healthfully -- that's the world that I imagine Thank you very much On Mondays and Thursdays I learn how to die I call them my terminal days My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it And I kept thinking one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor who looks at my exams and says Ricardo things don't look very good You have six months or a year to live And you start thinking about what you would do with this time And you say I'm going to spend more time with the kids I'm going to visit these places I'm going to go up and down mountains and places and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time But of course we all know these are very bittersweet memories we're going to have It's very difficult to do You spend a good part of the time crying probably So I said I'm going to do something else Every Monday and Thursday I'm going use my terminal days And I will do during those days whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news When you think about -- when you think about the opposite of work we many times think it's leisure And you say ah I need some leisure time and so forth But the fact is that leisure is a very busy thing You go play golf and tennis and you meet people and you're going for lunch and you're late for the movies It's a very crowded thing that we do The opposite of work is idleness But very few of us know what to do with idleness When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money we have very little time And then when we finally have time we have neither the money nor the health So we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years This is a complicated company with thousands of employees hundreds of millions of dollars of business that makes rocket fuel propellent systems runs 4，000 ATMs in Brazil does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands So this is not a simple business We looked at it and we said let's devolve to these people let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of this is when you arrive this is how you dress this is how you go to meetings this is what you say this is what you don't say and let's see what's left So we started this about 30 years ago and we started dealing with this very issue And so we said look the retirement the whole issue of how we distribute our graph of life Instead of going mountain climbing when you're 82 why don't you do it next week And we'll do it like this we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary So now if you were going to be a violinist which you probably weren't you go and do this on Wednesday And what we found -- we thought these are the older people who are going to be really interested in this program And the average age of the first people who adhered were 29 of course And so we started looking and we said we have to do things in a different way So we started saying things like why do we want to know what time you came to work what time you left etc。 Can't we exchange this for a contract for buying something from you some kind of work Why are we building these headquarters Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid and big and important But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it So we started asking questions one by one We'd say it like this: One: How do we find people We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say look when you come to us we're not going to have two or three interviews and then you're going to be married to us for life That's not how we do the rest of our lives So come have your interviews Anyone who's interested in interviewing you will show up And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that instead of just filling out the little items of whether you're the right person And then come back Spend an afternoon spend a whole day talk to anybody you want Make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads Slowly we went to a process where we'd say things like we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company if they haven't been interviewed and approved by their future subordinates Every six months everyone gets evaluated anonymously as a leader And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position which is many times situational as you know And so if they don't have 70 80 percent of a grade they don't stay which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years And over time we started asking other questions We said things like why can't people set their own salaries What do they need to know There's only three things you need to know: how much people make inside the company how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it So let's give people these three pieces of information So we started having in the cafeteria a computer where you could go in and you could ask what someone spent how much someone makes what they make in benefits what the company makes what the margins are and so forth And this is 25 years ago As this information started coming to people we said things like we don't want to see your expense report we don't want to know how many holidays you're taking we don't want to know where you work We had at one point 14 different offices around town and we'd say go to the one that's closest to your house to the customer that you're going to visit today Don't tell us where you are And more even when we had thousands of people 5，000 people we had two people in the H。R department and thankfully one of them has retired And so the question we were asking was how can we be taking care of people People are the only thing we have We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people So as we started finding that this worked and we'd say we're looking for -- and this is I think the main thing I was looking for in the terminal days and in the company which is how do you set up for wisdom We've come from an age of revolution industrial revolution an age of information an age of knowledge but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom How we design how do we organize for more wisdom So for example many times what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive So we'd say things like let's agree that you're going to sell 57 widgets per week If you sell them by Wednesday please go to the beach Don't create a problem for us for manufacturing for application then we have to buy new companies we have to buy our competitors we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets So go to the beach and start again on Monday So the process is looking for wisdom And in the process of course we wanted people to know everything and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things So our board had two seats open with the same voting rights for the first two people who showed up And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties And the fact is that they kept us honest This process as we started looking at the people who came to us we'd say now wait a second people come to us and they say where am I supposed to sit How am I supposed to work Where am I going to be in 5 years' time And we looked at that and we said we have to start much earlier Where do we start We said oh kindergarten seems like a good place So we set up a foundation which now has for 11 years three schools where we started asking the same questions how do you redesign school for wisdom It is one thing to say we need to recycle the teachers we need the directors to do more But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete The teacher's role is entirely obsolete Going from a math class to biology to 14th-century France is very silly So we started thinking what could it look like And we put together people including people who like education people like Paulo Freire and two ministers of education in Brazil and we said if we were to design a school from scratch what would it look like And so we created this school which is called Lumiar and Lumiar one of them is a public school and Lumiar says the following: Let's divide this role of the teacher into two One guy we'll call a tutor A tutor in the old sense of the Greek paideia: Look after the kid What's happening at home what's their moment in life etc。 But please don't teach because the little you know compared to Google we don't want to know Keep that to yourself Now we'll bring in people who have two things: passion and expertise and it could be their profession or not And we use the senior citizens who are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore So we bring them to school and we say teach these kids whatever you really believe in So we have violinists teaching math We have all kinds of things where we say don't worry about the course material anymore We have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 Things like how do we measure ourselves as humans So there's a place for math and physics and all that there How do we express ourselves So there's a place for music and literature etc。 but also for grammar And then we have things that everyone has forgotten which are probably the most important things in life The very important things in life we know nothing about We know nothing about love we know nothing about death we know nothing about why we're here So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know So that's a big part of what we do So over the years we started going into other things We'd say why do we have to scold the kids and say sit down and come here and do that and so forth We said let's get the kids to do something we call a circle which meets once a week And we'd say you put the rules together and then you decide what you want to do with it So can you all hit yourself on the head Sure for a week try They came up with the very same rules that we had except they're theirs And then they have the power which means they can and do suspend and expel kids so that we're not playing school they really decide And then in this same vein we keep a digital mosaic It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum with 600 tiles of a mosaic which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're 17 And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing and we say you're not interested in this now let's wait a year And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools in general And they have a zero to 100 percent grading which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours Until we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it And so the courses are World Cup Soccer or building a bicycle And people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle Now try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is 3。1416 You can't And try any one of you using 3。1416 for something You don't know anymore So this is lost and that's what we try to do there which is looking for wisdom in that school And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life I accumulated a lot of money when I think about it When you think and you say now is the time to give back -- well if you're giving back you took too much I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day and finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had And he looks and he says what am I going to do with this And he says I'll give it to someone who really needs this I'll give it to Bill Gates And my guy who's my financial advisor in New York he says look you're a silly guy because you would have 4。1 times more money today if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go But I like sharing as you go better I taught MBAs at MIT for a time and I ended up one day at the Mount Auburn Cemetery It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge And I was walking around It was my birthday and I was thinking And the first time around I saw these tombstones and these wonderful people who'd done great things and I thought what do I want to be remembered for And I did another stroll around and the second time another question came to me which did me better which was why do I want to be remembered at all And that I think took me different places When I was 50 my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon we had a big pit with fire and I threw everything I had ever done into that fire This is a book in 38 languages hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs everything there was And that did two things One it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow -- They don't know what I do Which is good And I'm not going to take them somewhere and say one day all of this will be yours The five kids know nothing which is good And the second thing is I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days And some people would say oh so now you have this time these terminal days and so you go out and do everything No we've been to the beaches so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique so that's done I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu I've gone to the magnetic North Pole on a dog sled So we've been busy It's what I'd like to call my empty bucket list And with this rationale I look at these days and I think I'm not retired I don't feel retired at all And so I'm writing a new book We started three new companies in the last two years I'm now working on getting this school system for free out into the world and I've found very interestingly enough that nobody wants it for free And so I've been trying for 10 years to get the public system to take over this school rationale much as the public schools we have which has instead of 43 out of 100 as their rating as their grades has 91 out of 100 But for free nobody wants it So maybe we'll start charging for it and then it will go somewhere But getting this out is one of the things we want to do And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you I think is a little bit like this: We've all learned how to go on Sunday night to email and work from home But very few of us have learned how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon And if we're looking for wisdom we need to learn to do that as well And so what we've done all of these years is very simple is use the little tool which is ask three whys in a row Because the first why you always have a good answer for The second why it starts getting difficult By the third why you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this you will come to the question what for What am I doing this for And hopefully as a result of that and over time I hope that with this and that's what I'm wishing you you'll have a much wiser future Thank you very much So Ricardo you're kind of crazy To many people this seems crazy And yet so deeply wise also The pieces I'm trying to put together are this: Your ideas are so radical How in business for example these ideas have been out for a while probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them is still quite low Are there any times you've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you've gone Yes！ with Richard Branson with his people saying oh I don't want to control your holidays anymore or Netflix does a little bit of this and that I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal but that's a very personal one But the fact is that it takes a leap of faith about losing control And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith It will have to come from kids and other people who are starting companies in a different way So that's the key thing From your point of view the evidence is there in the business point of view this works but people just don't have the courage to -- RS: They don't even have the incentive You're running a company with a 90-day mandate It's a quarterly report If you're not good in 90 days you're out So you say Here's a great program that in less than one generation -- And the guy says Get out of here So this is the problem What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound Everyone is bothered about their country's education system No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world where there's Google and all these technological options So you've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system there's a dramatic increase in performance How do we help you move these ideas forward RS: I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come And I've never been very evangelical about these things We put it out there Suddenly you find people -- there's a group in Japan which scares me very much which is called the Semlerists and they have 120 companies They've invited me I've always been scared to go And there is a group in Holland that has 600 small Dutch companies It's something that will flourish on its own Part of it will be wrong and it doesn't matter This will find its own place And I'm afraid of the other one which says this is so good you've got to do this Let's set up a system and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what So you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life It seems to me that's the fuel that's driven a lot of this Do you have any other questions for us for TED for this group here RS: I always come back to variations of the question that my son asked me when he was three We were sitting in a jacuzzi and he said Dad why do we exist There is no other question Nobody has any other question We have variations of this one question from three onwards So when you spend time in a company in a bureaucracy in an organization and you're saying boy -- how many people do you know who on their death beds said boy I wish I had spent more time at the office So there's a whole thing of having the courage now -- not in a week not in two months not when you find out you have something -- to say no what am I doing this for Stop everything Let me do something else And it will be okay it will be much better than what you're doing if you're stuck in a process So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end this penultimate day of TED Ricardo Semler thank you so much RS: Thank you so much So infectious diseases right Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world Every year millions of people die of diseases such as T。B。 malaria HIV around the world and even in the United States Every year thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu Now of course humans we are creative Right We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against these diseases We have drugs and vaccines And we're conscious -- we learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions We used to think we're alone in this but now we know we're not We're not the only medical doctors Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it too Most famous perhaps chimpanzees Not so much different from us they can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too: elephants porcupines sheep goats you name it And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains can use medication too The problem with infectious diseases as we all know is that pathogens continue to evolve and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy And therefore there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases Now I think that we should look at these animals and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases As a biologist I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years Now monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migrations from the U。S and Canada down to Mexico every year where millions of them come together but it's not why I started studying them I study monarchs because they get sick They get sick like you They get sick like me And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans Now the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful What they do is they produce spores millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that are shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly And this is really detrimental to the monarch It shortens their lifespan it reduces their ability to fly it can even kill them before they're even adults Very detrimental parasite As part of my job I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse growing plants and the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters They only eat milkweed as larvae Luckily there are several species of milkweed that they can use and all these milkweeds have cardenolides in them These are chemicals that are toxic They're toxic to most animals but not to monarchs In fact monarchs can take up the chemicals put it in their own bodies and it makes them toxic against their predators such as birds And what they do then is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange black and white So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse different ones different milkweeds Some were toxic including the tropical milkweed And some were not toxic And then I fed them to monarchs Some of the monarchs were healthy They had no disease But some of the monarchs were sick and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants And when I found this I had this idea and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea but I thought what if monarchs can use this What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine What if they can act as medical doctors So my team and I started doing experiments In the first types of experiments we had caterpillars and gave them a choice: medicinal milkweed versus non-medicinal milkweed And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime And the result as so often in science was boring: Fifty percent of their food was medicinal Fifty percent was not These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare So then we moved on to adult butterflies and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick We have done these experiments now over several years and always get the same results What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage a medicinal plant on one side a non-medicinal plant on the other side and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant And what we find when we do that is always the same What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed In other words what these females are doing is they're laying 68 percent of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed Intriguingly what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they're laying the eggs They cannot prevent this They can also not medicate themselves But what these experiments tell us is that these monarchs these mothers can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick Now this is a really important discovery I think not just because it tells us something cool about nature but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs Now these are animals that are very small and we tend to think of them as very simple They have tiny little brains yet they can do this very sophisticated medication Now we know that even today most of our drugs derive from natural products including plants and in indigenous cultures traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs In this way elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea What I think is important though is to move beyond these large-brained mammals and give these guys more credit these simple animals these insects that we tend to think of as very very simple with tiny little brains The discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues and I think that maybe one day we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies and I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing Thank you so much Some years ago I stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems and like many of these design exercises it kind of seems trivial at first but under deep inspection it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things The exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do which is how to make toast It begins with a clean sheet of paper a felt marker and without using any words you begin to draw how to make toast And most people draw something like this They draw a loaf of bread which is sliced then put into a toaster The toast is then deposited for some time It pops up and then voila After two minutes toast and happiness Now over the years I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts and some of them are very good because they really illustrate the toast-making process quite clearly And then there are some that are well not so good They really suck actually because you don't know what they're trying to say Under close inspection some reveal some aspects of toast-making while hiding others So there's some that are all about the toast and all about the transformation of toast And there's others that are all about the toaster and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this And then there are others that are about people It's about visualizing the experience that people have And then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store It goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation and all the way back to the field and wheat and one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang So it's crazy stuff But I think it's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different they share a common quality and I'm wondering if you can see it Do you see it What's common about these Most drawings have nodes and links So nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people and links represent the connections between the nodes And it's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works So that's the value of these things What's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view So for example Americans make toast with a toaster That seems obvious Whereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan of course and many students make toast with a fire I don't really understand this A lot of MBA students do this So you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes Less than that the drawing seems trivial but it's quick to understand and more than 13 the drawing produces a feeling of map shock It's too complex So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13 So if you want to communicate something visually have between five and 13 nodes in your diagram So though we may not be skilled at drawing the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then bring them back together again So this brings us to our second part of the exercise which is how to make toast but now with sticky notes or with cards So what happens then Well with cards most people tend to draw clear more detailed and more logical nodes You can see the step by step analysis that takes place and as they build up their model they move their nodes around rearranging them like Lego blocks Now though this might seem trivial it's actually really important This rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing is really the only way in which we get clarity It's the essence of the design process And systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model So sticky note systems are not only more fluid they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings The drawings are much richer And this brings us to our third part of the exercise which is to draw how to make toast but this time in a group So what happens then Well here's what happens It starts out messy and then it gets really messy and then it gets messier but as people refine the models the best nodes become more prominent and with each iteration the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other's ideas What emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view so that's a really different outcome from what usually happens in meetings isn't it So these drawings can contain 20 or more nodes but participants don't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves Now what's also really interesting that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it To deal with contradictions for example they add branching patterns and parallel patterns Oh and by the way if they do it in complete silence they do it much better and much more quickly Really interesting -- talking gets in the way So here's some key lessons that can emerge from this First drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships Movable cards produce better systems models because we iterate much more fluidly And then the group notes produce the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view So that's interesting When people work together under the right circumstances group models are much better than individual models So this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing like your organizational vision or customer experience or long-term sustainability There's a visual revolution that's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out And I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge And the practice is really pretty simple You start with a question you collect the nodes you refine the nodes you do it over again you refine and refine and refine and the patterns emerge and the group gets clarity and you answer the question So this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again produces some really remarkable outcomes What's really important to know is that it's the conversations that are the important aspects not just the models themselves And these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes So one example is from an organization called Rodale Big publishing company They lost a bunch of money one year and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice And what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business systems upon systems they reclaimed 50 million dollars of revenue and they also moved from a D rating to an A rating from their customers Why Because there's alignment from the executive team So I'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization and on a site that I've produced called drawtoast。com I've collected a bunch of best practices and so you can learn how to run a workshop here you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem-solving and download examples of various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations So the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear engaged and aligned So next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge remember what design has to teach us Make your ideas visible tangible and consequential It's simple it's fun it's powerful and I believe it's an idea worth celebrating Thank you When I was invited to give this talk a couple of months ago we discussed a number of titles with the organizers and a lot of different items were kicked around and were discussed But nobody suggested this one and the reason for that was two months ago and spreading over wider geographic areas than we had ever seen and the world was terrified concerned and alarmed by this disease in a way we've not seen in recent history But today I can stand here and I can talk to you about beating Ebola because of people whom you've never heard of people like Peter Clement a Liberian doctor who's working in Lofa County a place that many of you have never heard of probably in Liberia The reason that Lofa County is so important is because about five months ago when the epidemic was just starting to escalate Lofa County was right at the center the epicenter of this epidemic At that time MSF and the treatment center there they were seeing dozens of patients every single day and these patients these communities were becoming more and more terrified as time went by with this disease and what it was doing to their families to their communities to their children to their relatives And so Peter Clement was charged with driving that 12-hour-long rough road from Monrovia the capital up to Lofa County to try and help bring control to the escalating epidemic there And what Peter found when he arrived was the terror that I just mentioned to you So he sat down with the local chiefs and he listened And what he heard was heartbreaking He heard about the devastation and the desperation of people affected by this disease He heard the heartbreaking stories about not just the damage that Ebola did to people but what it did to families and what it did to communities And he listened to the local chiefs there and what they told him -- They said When our children are sick when our children are dying we can't hold them at a time when we want to be closest to them When our relatives die we can't take care of them as our tradition demands We are not allowed to wash the bodies to bury them the way our communities and our rituals demand And for this reason they were deeply disturbed deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling in front of them People were turning on the healthcare workers who had come the heroes who had come to try and help save the community to help work with the community and they were unable to access them And what happened then was Peter explained to the leaders The leaders listened They turned the tables And Peter explained what Ebola was He explained what the disease was He explained what it did to their communities Ebola means you can't hold your children the way you would in this situation You can't bury your dead the way that you would You have to trust these people in these space suits to do that for you And ladies and gentlemen what happened then was rather extraordinary: The community and the health workers Peter they sat down together and they put together a new plan for controlling Ebola in Lofa County And the reason that this is such an important story ladies and gentlemen is because today this county which is right at the center of this epidemic you've been watching you've been seeing in the newspapers you've been seeing on the television screens today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks without seeing a single case of Ebola Now this doesn't mean that the job is done obviously There's still a huge risk that there will be additional cases there But what it does teach us is that Ebola can be beaten That's the key thing Even on this scale even with the rapid kind of growth that we saw in this environment here we now know Ebola can be beaten When communities come together with health care workers work together that's when this disease can be stopped But how did Ebola end up in Lofa County in the first place Well for that we have to go back 12 months to the start of this epidemic And as many of you know this virus went undetected it evaded detection for three or four months when it began That's because this is not a disease of West Africa it's a disease of Central Africa half a continent away People hadn't seen the disease before; health workers hadn't seen the disease before They didn't know what they were dealing with and to make it even more complicated the virus itself was causing a symptom a type of a presentation that wasn't classical of the disease So people didn't even recognize the disease people who knew Ebola For that reason it evaded detection for some time But contrary to public belief sometimes these days once the virus was detected there was a rapid surge in of support MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment center as many of you know in the area The World Health Organization and the partners that it works with deployed eventually hundreds of people over the next two months to be able to help track the virus The problem ladies and gentlemen is by then this virus well known now as Ebola had spread too far It had already outstripped what was one of the largest responses that had been mounted so far to an Ebola outbreak By the middle of the year not just Guinea but now Sierra Leone and Liberia were also infected As the virus was spreading geographically the numbers were increasing and at this time not only were hundreds of people infected and dying of the disease but as importantly the front line responders the people who had gone to try and help the health care workers the other responders were also sick and dying by the dozens The presidents of these countries recognized the emergencies They met right around that time they agreed on common action to implement the strategies we talked about But what happened then was something we had never seen before with Ebola What happened then was the virus or someone sick with the virus boarded an airplane flew to another country and for the first time we saw in another distant country the virus pop up again This time it was in Nigeria in the teeming metropolis of Lagos 21 million people Now the virus was in that environment And as you can anticipate there was international alarm international concern on a scale that we hadn't seen in recent years caused by a disease like this The World Health Organization immediately called together an expert panel looked at the situation declared an international emergency And in doing so the expectation would be that there would be a huge outpouring of international assistance to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time But what we saw was something very different There was some great response A number of countries came to assist -- many many NGOs and others as you know but at the same time the opposite happened in many places Alarm escalated and very soon these countries found themselves not receiving the support they needed but increasingly isolated What we saw was commercial airlines started flying into these countries and people who hadn't even been exposed to the virus were no longer allowed to travel This cause not only problems obviously for the countries themselves but also for the response Those organizations that were trying to bring people in to try and help them respond to the outbreak they could not get people on airplanes they could not get them into the countries to be able to respond In that situation ladies and gentleman a virus like Ebola takes advantage And what we saw then was something also we hadn't seen before Not only did this virus continue in the places where they'd already become infected but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here something we'd never seen before on such a scale an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spreading further and deeper into these countries Ladies and gentleman this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen And what happened in these countries then many of you saw again on the television read about in the newspapers we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic We saw the schools begin to close markets no longer started no longer functioned the way that they should in these countries even faster through the communities which became even more alarmed about the situation as they call them who had come to help them And then the situation deteriorated even further The countries had to declare a state of emergency Large populations needed to be quarantined in some areas and then riots broke out It was a very very terrifying situation Around the world many people began to ask can we ever stop Ebola when it starts to spread like this And they started to ask how well do we really know this virus The reality is we don't know Ebola extremely well It's a relatively modern disease in terms of what we know about it We've known the disease only for 40 years since it first popped up in Central Africa in 1976 But despite that we do know many things: We know that this virus probably survives in a type of a bat We know that it probably enters a human population when we come in contact with a wild animal Then we know that the virus spreads from person to person through contaminated body fluids And as you've all seen we know the horrific disease that it then causes in humans where we see this disease cause severe fevers diarrhea vomiting and then unfortunately in 70 percent of the cases or often more death This is a very dangerous debilitating and deadly disease But despite the fact that we've not known this disease for a particularly long time and we don't know everything about it we do know how to stop this disease There are four things that are critical to stopping Ebola First and foremost the communities have got to understand this disease they've got to understand how it spreads and how to stop it And then we've got to be able to have systems that can find every single case every contact of those cases and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission We have to have treatment centers specialized Ebola treatment centers where the workers can be protected as they try to provide support to the people who are infected so that they might survive the disease And then for those who do die we have to ensure there is a safe but at the same time dignified burial process so that there is no spread at that time as well So we do know how to stop Ebola and these strategies work ladies and gentlemen The virus was stopped in Nigeria by these four strategies and the people implementing them obviously It was stopped in Senegal where it had spread and also in the other countries that were affected by this virus in this outbreak So there's no question that these strategies actually work The big question ladies and gentlemen was whether these strategies could work on this scale in this situation with so many countries affected with the kind of exponential growth that you saw That was the big question that we were facing just two or three months ago Today we know the answer to that question And we know that answer because of the extraordinary work of an incredible group of NGOs of governments of local leaders of U。N agencies and many humanitarian and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop Ebola in West Africa But what had to be done there was slightly different These countries took those strategies I just showed you; the community engagement the case finding contact tracing etc。 and they turned them on their head There was so much disease they approached it differently What they decided to do was they would first try and slow down this epidemic by rapidly building as many beds as possible in specialized treatment centers so that they could prevent the disease from spreading from those were infected They would rapidly build out many many burial teams so that they could safely deal with the dead and with that they would try and slow this outbreak to see if it could actually then be controlled using the classic approach of case finding and contact tracing And when I went to West Africa about three months ago when I was there what I saw was extraordinary I saw presidents opening emergency operation centers themselves against Ebola so that they could personally coordinate and oversee and champion this surge of international support to try and stop this disease We saw militaries from within those countries and from far beyond coming in to help build Ebola treatment centers that could be used to isolate those who were sick We saw the Red Cross movement working with its partner agencies on the ground there to help train the communities so that they could actually safely bury their dead in a dignified manner themselves And we saw the U。N agencies the World Food Program build a tremendous air bridge that could get responders to every single corner of these countries rapidly to be able to implement the strategies that we just talked about What we saw ladies and gentlemen which was probably most impressive was this incredible work by the governments by the leaders in these countries with the communities to try to ensure people understood this disease understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop Ebola And as a result ladies and gentlemen we saw something that we did not know only two or three months earlier whether or not it would be possible when we took stock on December 1 What we saw was we could bend that curve so to speak change this exponential growth and bring some hope back to the ability to control this outbreak The big question though that many people are asking even when they saw this curve they said Well hang on a minute -- that's great you can slow it down but can you actually drive it down to zero We already answered that question back at the beginning of this talk when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia We told you the story how Lofa County got to a situation where they have not seen Ebola for eight weeks But there are similar stories from the other countries as well From Gueckedou in Guinea the first area where the first case was actually diagnosed We've seen very very few cases in the last couple of months and here in Kenema in Sierra Leone another area in the epicenter we have not seen the virus for more than a couple of weeks -- way too early to declare victory obviously but evidence ladies and gentlemen not only can the response catch up to the disease but this disease can be driven to zero The challenge now of course is doing this on the scale needed right across these three countries and that is a huge challenge Because when you've been at something for this long on this scale two other big threats come in to join the virus The first of those is complacency the risk that as this disease curve starts to bend the media look elsewhere the world looks elsewhere Complacency always a risk And the other risk of course is when you've been working so hard for so long and slept so few hours over the past months people are tired people become fatigued and these new risks start to creep into the response Ladies and gentlemen I can tell you today I've just come back from West Africa The people of these countries the leaders of these countries they are not complacent They want to drive Ebola to zero in their countries And these people yes they're tired but they are not fatigued They have an energy they have a courage they have the strength to get this finished What they need ladies and gentlemen at this point is the unwavering support of the international community to stand with them to bolster and bring even more support at this time to get the job finished Because finishing Ebola right now means turning the tables on this virus and beginning to hunt it Remember this virus this whole crisis rather started with one case and is going to finish with one case But it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists enough health workers enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases track their contacts and make sure that this disease stops once and for all Ladies and gentleman Ebola can be beaten Now we need you to take this story out to tell it to the people who will listen and educate them on what it means to beat Ebola and more importantly we need you to advocate with the people who can help us bring the resources we need to these countries to beat this disease There are a lot of people out there who will survive and will thrive in part because of what you do to help us beat Ebola Thank you So recently we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest and that's true but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements I've come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them This is not inevitable but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term And the lessons apply in multiple domains Now take Turkey's Gezi Park protests July 2013 which I went back to study in the field Twitter was key to its organizing It was everywhere in the park -- well along with a lot of tear gas It wasn't all high tech But the people in Turkey had already gotten used to the power of Twitter because of an unfortunate incident about a year before when military jets had bombed and killed 34 Kurdish smugglers near the border region and Turkish media completely censored this news Editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do One frustrated journalist could not take this anymore He purchased his own plane ticket and went to the village where this had occurred And he was confronted by this scene: a line of coffins coming down a hill relatives wailing He later he told me how overwhelmed he felt and didn't know what to do so he took out his phone like any one of us might and snapped that picture and tweeted it out And voila that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it So when a year later Turkey's Gezi protests happened it started as a protest about a park being razed but became an anti-authoritarian protest It wasn't surprising that media also censored it but it got a little ridiculous at times When things were so intense when CNN International was broadcasting live from Istanbul CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins Now I love penguin documentaries but that wasn't the news of the day An angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture and that one too went viral and since then people call Turkish media the penguin media But this time people knew what to do They just took out their phones and looked for actual news Better they knew to go to the park and take pictures and participate and share it more on social media Digital connectivity was used for everything from food to donations Everything was organized partially with the help of these new technologies And using Internet to mobilize and publicize protests actually goes back a long way Remember the Zapatistas the peasant uprising in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico led by the masked pipe-smoking charismatic Subcomandante Marcos That was probably the first movement that got global attention thanks to the Internet Or consider Seattle '99 when a multinational grassroots effort brought global attention to what was then an obscure organization the World Trade Organization by also utilizing these digital technologies to help them organize And more recently movement after movement has shaken country after country: the Arab uprisings from Bahrain to Tunisia to Egypt and more; indignados in Spain Italy Greece; the Gezi Park protests; Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong And think of more recent initiatives like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags Nowadays a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign A Facebook page can become the hub of a massive mobilization Amazing But think of the moments I just mentioned The achievements they were able to have their outcomes are not really proportional to the size and energy they inspired The hopes they rightfully raised are not really matched by what they were able to have as a result in the end And this raises a question: As digital technology makes things easier for movements why haven't successful outcomes become more likely as well In embracing digital platforms for activism and politics are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way Now I believe so I believe that the rule of thumb is: Easier to mobilize does not always mean easier to achieve gains Now to be clear technology does empower in multiple ways It's very powerful In Turkey I watched four young college students organize a countrywide citizen journalism network called 140Journos that became the central hub for uncensored news in the country In Egypt I saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals very large operations during massive clashes near Tahrir Square in 2011 And I asked the founder of this effort called Tahrir Supplies how long it took him to go from when he had the idea to when he got started Five minutes he said Five minutes And he had no training or background in logistics Or think of the Occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011 It started with a single email About two months after that first email there were in the United States 600 ongoing occupations and protests Less than one month after the first physical occupation in Zuccotti Park a global protest was held in about 82 countries 950 cities It was one of the largest global protests ever organized Now compare that to what the Civil Rights Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama to protest the racially segregated bus system which they wanted to boycott They'd been preparing for many years and decided it was time to swing into action after Rosa Parks was arrested But how do you get the word out -- tomorrow we're going to start the boycott -- when you don't have Facebook texting Twitter none of that So they had to mimeograph 52，000 leaflets by sneaking into a university duplicating room and working all night secretly They then used the 68 African-American organizations that criss-crossed the city to distribute those leaflets by hand And the logistical tasks were daunting because these were poor people They had to get to work boycott or no so a massive carpool was organized again by meeting No texting no Twitter no Facebook They had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going Today it would be so much easier We could create a database available rides and what rides you need have the database coordinate and use texting We wouldn't have to meet all that much But again consider this: the Civil Rights Movement in the United States navigated a minefield of political dangers faced repression and overcame won major policy concessions navigated and innovated through risks In contrast three years after Occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality the policies that fueled it are still in place Europe was also rocked by anti-austerity protests but the continent didn't shift its direction In embracing these technologies are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained To understand this I went back to Turkey about a year after the Gezi protests and I interviewed a range of people from activists to politicians from both the ruling party and the opposition party and movements I found that the Gezi protesters were despairing They were frustrated and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for This echoed what I'd been hearing around the world from many other protesters that I'm in touch with And I've come to realize that part of the problem is that today's protests have become a bit like climbing Mt Everest with the help of 60 Sherpas and the Internet is our Sherpa What we're doing is taking the fast routes and not replacing the benefits of the slower work Because you see the kind of work that went into organizing all those daunting tedious logistical tasks did not just take care of those tasks they also created the kind of organization that could think together collectively and make hard decisions together create consensus and innovate and maybe even more crucially keep going together through differences So when you see this March on Washington in 1963 when you look at that picture where this is the march where Martin Luther King gave his famous I have a dream speech 1963 you don't just see a march and you don't just hear a powerful speech you also see the painstaking long-term work that can put on that march And if you're in power you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march not just the march but the capacity signaled by that march seriously In contrast when you look at Occupy's global marches that were organized in two weeks you see a lot of discontent but you don't necessarily see teeth that can bite over the long term And crucially the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges They feel a little like startups that got very big without knowing what to do next and they rarely manage to shift tactically because they don't have the depth of capacity to weather such transitions Now I want to be clear: The magic is not in the mimeograph It's in that capacity to work together think together collectively which can only be built over time with a lot of work To understand all this I interviewed a top official from the ruling party in Turkey and I ask him How do you do it They too use digital technology extensively so that's not it So what's the secret Well he told me He said the key is he never took sugar with his tea I said what has that got to do with anything Well he said his party starts getting ready for the next election the day after the last one and he spends all day every day meeting with voters in their homes in their wedding parties circumcision ceremonies and then he meets with his colleagues to compare notes With that many meetings every day with tea offered at every one of them which he could not refuse because that would be rude he could not take even one cube of sugar per cup of tea because that would be many kilos of sugar he can't even calculate how many kilos and at that point I realized why he was speaking so fast We had met in the afternoon and he was already way over-caffeinated But his party won two major elections within a year of the Gezi protests with comfortable margins To be sure governments have different resources to bring to the table It's not the same game but the differences are instructive And like all such stories this is not a story just of technology It's what technology allows us to do converging with what we want to do Today's social movements want to operate informally They do not want institutional leadership They want to stay out of politics because they fear corruption and cooptation They have a point Modern representative democracies are being strangled in many countries by powerful interests But operating this way makes it hard for them to sustain over the long term and exert leverage over the system which leads to frustrated protesters dropping out and even more corrupt politics And politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial Climate change is barreling towards us Inequality is stifling human growth and potential and economies Authoritarianism is choking many countries We need movements to be more effective Now some people have argued that the problem is today's movements are not formed of people who take as many risks as before and that is not true From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere I've seen people put their lives and livelihoods on the line It's also not true as Malcolm Gladwell claimed that today's protesters form weaker virtual ties No they come to these protests just like before with their friends existing networks and sometimes they do make new friends for life I still see the friends that I made in those Zapatista-convened global protests more than a decade ago and the bonds between strangers are not worthless When I got tear-gassed in Gezi people I didn't know helped me and one another instead of running away In Tahrir I saw people protesters working really hard to keep each other safe and protected And digital awareness-raising is great because changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics But movements today have to move beyond participation at great scale very fast and figure out how to think together collectively develop strong policy proposals create consensus figure out the political steps and relate them to leverage because all these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by itself are not going to be enough And there are many efforts In New Zealand a group of young people are developing a platform called Loomio for participatory decision making at scale In Turkey 140Journos are holding hack-a-thons so that they support communities as well as citizen journalism In Argentina an open-source platform called DemocracyOS is bringing participation to parliaments and political parties These are all great and we need more but the answer won't just be better online decision-making because to update democracy we are going to need to innovate at every level from the organizational to the political to the social Because to succeed over the long term sometimes you do need tea without sugar along with your Twitter Thank you Hi Today I'm going to share my personal journey with female genital mutilation FGM Feel free to cry laugh cross your legs or do anything your body feels like doing I was born in Sierra Leone Did anybody watch Blood Diamond If you have any thoughts -- I don't have any diamonds on me by the way If you have heard of Ebola well that's in Sierra Leone as well I don't have Ebola You're all safe Don't rush to the door Be seated You're fine I was checked before I got here My grandfather had three wives Don't ask me why a man needs more than one wife Men do you need more than one wife I don't think so There you go He was looking for a heart attack that's what I say Oh yeah he was When I was three war broke out in Sierra Leone in 1991 I remember literally going to bed one night everything was good The next day I woke up bombs were dropping everywhere and people were trying to kill me and my family We escaped the war and ended up in Gambia in West Africa Ebola is there as well Stay away from it While we were there as refugees we didn't know what was going to become of us My mom applied for refugee status She's a wonderful smart woman that one and we were lucky Australia said we will take you in Good job Aussies Before we were meant to travel my mom came home one day and said We're going on a little holiday a little trip She put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in Gambia In this bush we found two huts An old lady came towards us She was ethnic-looking very old She had a chat with my mom and went back Then she came back and walked away from us into a second hut I'm standing there thinking This is very confusing I don't know what's going on The next thing I knew my mom took me into this hut She took my clothes off and then she pinned me down on the floor I struggled and tried to get her off me but I couldn't Then the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife one of the sharp knives orange-looking has never seen water or sunlight before I thought she was going to slaughter me but she didn't She slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is She took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris she took that rusty knife and started cutting away inch by inch I screamed I cried and asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop but all she did was say Be quiet This old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever and then when she was done she threw that piece of flesh across the floor as if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched They both got off me and left me there bleeding crying and confused as to what just happened We never talked about this again Very soon we found that we were coming to Australia and this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time and people said we were going to the end of the world there was nowhere else to go after Australia Yeah that comforted us a bit It took us three days to get here We went to Senegal then France and then Singapore We went to the bathroom to wash our hands We spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this Then somebody came in slid their hand under and water came out and we thought is this what we're in for Like seriously We got to Adelaide small place where literally they dumped us in Adelaide that's what I would say They dumped us there We were very grateful We settled and we liked it We were like We're home we're here Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall Adelaide has only one mall It's this small place And we saw a lot of Asian people My mom said all of a sudden panicking You brought us to the wrong place You must take us back to Australia Yeah It had to be explained to her that there were a lot of Asians in Australia and we were in the right place So fine it's all good My mom then had this brilliant idea that I should go to a girls school because they were less racist I don't know where she read that publication Never found evidence of it to this day Six hundred white kids and I was the only black child there No I was the only person with a bit of a color on me Let me say that Chocolate color There were no Asians no indigenous All we had was some tan girls girls who felt the need to be under the sun It wasn't the same as my chocolate though Not the same Settling in Australia was quite hard but it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization called Women's Health Statewide and I joined their female genital mutilation program without any awareness of what this program was actually about or that it related to me in any way I spent months educating nurses and doctors about what female genital mutilation was and where it was practiced: Africa the Middle East Asia and now Australia and London and America because as we all know we live in a multicultural society and people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture and sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with but they continue to practice them One day I was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation FGM I will just say FGM for short Type I is when they cut off the hood Type II is when they cut off the whole clitoris and some of your labia majora or your outer lips and Type III is when they cut off the whole clitoris and then they sew you up so you only have a little hole to pee and have your period My eyes went onto Type II Before all of this I pretty much had amnesia I was in so much shock and traumatized by what had happened I didn't remember any of it Yes I was aware something bad happened to me but I had no recollection of what had happened I knew I had a scar down there but I thought everybody had a scar down there This had happened to everybody else But when I looked at Type II it all came back to me I remembered what was done to me I remembered being in that hut with that old lady and my mom holding me down Words cannot express the pain I felt the confusion that I felt because now I realized that what was done to me was a terrible thing that in this society was called barbaric it was called mutilation My mother had said it was called circumcision but here it was mutilation I was thinking I'm mutilated I'm a mutilated person Oh my God And then the anger came I was a black angry woman Oh yeah A little one but angry nevertheless I went home and said to my mom You did something This is not the African thing to do pointing at your mother but hey I was ready for any consequences You did something to me She's like What are you talking about Khadija She's used to me mouthing off I'm like Those years ago You circumcised me You cut away something that belonged to me She said Yes I did I did it for your own good It was in your best interest Your grandmother did it to me and I did it to you It's made you a woman I'm like How She said You're empowered Khadija Do you get itchy down there I'm like No why would I get itchy down there She said Well if you were not circumcised you would get itchy down there Women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time Then they sleep around with everybody You are not going to sleep around with anybody And I thought her definition of empowerment was very strange That was the end of our first conversation I went back to school These were the days when we had Dolly and Girlfriend magazines There was always the sealed section Anybody remember those sealed sections The naughty bits you know Oh yeah I love those Anyway there was always an article about pleasure and relationships and of course sex But it always assumed that you had a clitoris though and I thought this doesn't fit me This doesn't talk about people like me I don't have a clitoris I watched TV and those women would moan like Oh Oh I was like these people and their damned clitoris What is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life That's what I want to know I want to do that too -- Oh Oh and all of that Didn't happen So I came home once again and said to my mom that I should be having orgasms and that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris Apparently white men have a problem finding the clitoris Just saying it wasn't me It was Dolly that said that And I thought to myself I had an inner joke in my head that said I will marry a white man He won't have that problem with me So I said to my mom Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure and do you know what you have taken away from me what you have denied me You have invaded me in the most sacred way I want pleasure I want to get horny dammit as well And she said to me Who is Dolly and Girlfriend Are they your new friends Khadija I was like No they're not That's a magazine mom a magazine She didn't get it We came from two different worlds When she was growing up not having a clitoris was the norm It was celebrated I was an African Australian girl It was all about the damn clitoris And I didn't have one That pissed me off So once I went through this strange phase of anger and pain and confusion I remember booking an appointment with my therapist Yes I'm an African who has a therapist There you go And I said to her I was 13 I was a child I was settling in a new country I was dealing with racism and discrimination English is my third language and then there it was I said to her I feel like I'm not a woman because of what was done to me I feel incomplete Am I going to be asexual Because from what I knew about FGM the whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women It's so that we don't have any sexual desire And I said Am I asexual now Will I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex not enjoying sex She couldn't answer my questions so they went unanswered When I started having my period around the age of 14 I realized I didn't have normal periods because of FGM My periods were heavy they were long and they were very painful Then they told me I had fibroids They're like these little balls sitting there One was covering one of my ovaries And there came then the big news We don't think you can have children Khadija And once again I was an angry black woman I went home and I said to my mom Your act your action no matter what your may defense may be -- because she thought she did it out love -- what you did out of love is harming me and it's hurting me What do you have to say for that She said I did what I had to do as a mother I'm still waiting for an apology by the way Then I got married And once again -- FGM is like the gift that keeps giving You figure that out very soon Sex was very painful It hurt all the time And of course I realized they said You can't have kids I thought Wow is this my existence Is this what life is all about I'm proud to tell you five months ago I was told I was pregnant I am the lucky girl There are so many women out there who have gone through FGM who have infertility I know a nine-year-old girl who has incontinence constant infections pain It's that gift It doesn't stop giving It affects every area of your life and this happened to me because I was born a girl in the wrong place That's why it happened to me I channel all that anger all that pain into advocacy because I needed my pain to be worth something So I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia You heard me right Why No FGM Australia FGM is in Australia Two days ago I had to call Child Protective Services because somewhere in Australia there's a four-year old there's a four-year-old whose mom is planning on performing FGM on her That child is in kindy I'll let that sink in: four years old A couple of months ago I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man Her husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters back to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris And she said Why He said they were dirty And she said Well you married me He said Oh this is my cultural belief They then went into a whole discussion where she said to him Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters But imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was if they never had that conversation Her children would have been flown over to Malaysia and they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives Do you know the millions of dollars it would take us to deal with an issue like that Three children per day in Australia are at risk of having FGM performed on them This is an Australian problem people It's not an African problem It's not a Middle Eastern problem It's not white it's not black it has no color it's everybody's problem FGM is child abuse It's violence against women It's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure It says we don't have a right to our bodies Well I say no to that and you know what Bullshit That's what I have to say to that I am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM What are you going to do There may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM There may be a patient who comes to your hospital who is at risk of FGM But this is the reality that even in our beloved Australia the most wonderful place in the world children are being abused because of a culture Culture should not be a defense for child abuse I want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you Make it personal It could be your daughter your sister your cousin I can't fight FGM alone I could try but I can't So my appeal to you is please join me and type in Khadija my name and it'll come up and sign it The aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them because every child has a right to pleasure Every child has a right to their bodies being left intact and dammit ever child has a right to a clitoris So please join me in ending this act My favorite quote is All it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men and women to do nothing Are you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation to prevail in Australia I don't think so so please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation Thank you On June 12 2014 precisely at 3:33 in a balmy winter afternoon in São Paulo Brazil a typical South American winter afternoon this kid this young man that you see celebrating here like he had scored a goal Juliano Pinto 29 years old accomplished a magnificent deed Despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from mid-chest to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother and produced a complete spinal cord lesion that left Juliano in a wheelchair Juliano rose to the occasion and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed impossible Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick of the 2014 Brazilian World Soccer Cup here just by thinking He could not move his body but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball He was an athlete before the lesion He's a para-athlete right now But what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from Juliano was his ability to dream And dream he did that afternoon for a stadium of about 75，000 people and an audience of close to a billion watching on TV And that kick crowned basically 30 years of basic research studying how the brain how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about 100 billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms what Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories and about 15 years to plan When John Chapin and I 15 years ago proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices no matter how far they are from their own bodies just by imagining what they want to do our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help of the psychiatry variety And despite that a Scot and a Brazilian persevered because that's how we were raised in our respective countries and for 12 15 years we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible And a brain-machine interface is not rocket science it's just brain research It's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord so we projected sensors that can read hundreds and now thousands of these brain cells simultaneously and extract from these electrical signals the motor planning that the brain is generating to actually make us move into space And by doing that we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical electronic or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he she or it wants to make move and the device obeys that brain command By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors as you are going to see in a moment we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted no matter where -- next to the subject next door or across the planet And as this message gave feedback back to the brain the brain realized its goal: to make us move So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago where a monkey without moving its body learned to control the movements of an avatar arm a virtual arm that doesn't exist What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space And to get a reward a drop of orange juice that monkeys love this animal has to detect select one of these objects by touching not by seeing it by touching it because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab and if he does that he gets a reward without moving a muscle The perfect Brazilian lunch: not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice So as we saw this happening we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago We reenacted this paper We got it out of the drawers and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility The idea was that if you suffered -- and that can happen to any one of us Let me tell you it's very sudden It's a millisecond of a collision a car accident that transforms your life completely If you have a complete lesion of the spinal cord you cannot move because your brainstorms cannot reach your muscles However your brainstorms continue to be generated in your head Paraplegic quadriplegic patients dream about moving every night They have that inside their head The problem is how to get that code out of it and make the movement be created again So what we proposed was let's create a new body Let's create a robotic vest And that's exactly why Juliano could kick that ball just by thinking because he was wearing the first brain-controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback That was the original idea 15 years ago What I'm going to show you is how 156 people from 25 countries all over the five continents of this beautiful Earth dropped their lives dropped their patents dropped their dogs wives kids school jobs and congregated to come to Brazil for 18 months to actually get this done Because a couple years after Brazil was awarded the World Cup we heard that the Brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the Germans of course But that's a different talk and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that But what Brazil wanted to do is to showcase a completely different country a country that values science and technology and can give a gift to millions 25 million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury Well we went to the Brazilian government and to FIFA and proposed well let's have the kickoff of the 2014 World Cup be given by a Brazilian paraplegic using a brain-controlled exoskeleton that allows him to kick the ball and to feel the contact of the ball They looked at us thought that we were completely nuts and said Okay let's try We had 18 months to do everything from zero from scratch We had no exoskeleton we had no patients we had nothing done These people came all together and in 18 months we got eight patients in a routine of training and basically built from nothing this guy that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1 The first brain-controlled exoskeleton to be built was named after the most famous Brazilian scientist ever Alberto Santos Dumont who on October 19 1901 created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in Paris for a million people to see Sorry my American friends I live in North Carolina but it was two years before the Wright Brothers flew on the coast of North Carolina Flight control is Brazilian So we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together 15 degrees of freedom hydraulic machine that can be commanded by brain signals recorded by a non-invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls the motors and get it done This exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by Gordon Cheng one of my greatest friends in Munich to allow sensation from the joints moving and the foot touching the ground to be delivered back to the patient through a vest a shirt It is a smart shirt with micro-vibrating elements that basically delivers the feedback and fools the patient's brain by creating a sensation that it is not a machine that is carrying him but it is he who is walking again So we got this going and what you'll see here is the first time one of our patients Bruno actually walked And he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because Bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs to be performed the computer is going to analyze it Bruno is going to certify it and when it is certified the device starts moving under the command of Bruno's brain And he just got it right and now he starts walking After nine years without being able to move he is walking by himself And more than that -- -- more than just walking he is feeling the ground and if the speed of the exo goes up he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head So he walks and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already -- he says You know guys I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself Of course he will have it whenever he wants And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup and couldn't because for some mysterious reason FIFA cut its broadcast in half What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation Basically the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen And in basically 13 seconds Juliano actually did You can see the commands He gets ready the ball is set and he kicks And the most amazing thing is 10 seconds after he did that and looked at us on the pitch he told us celebrating as you saw I felt the ball And that's priceless So where is this going to go I have two minutes to tell you that it's going to the limits of your imagination Brain-actuating technology is here This is the latest: We just published this a year ago the first brain-to-brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental SMS a torpedo a neurophysiological torpedo to the second animal and the second animal performs the act that he needed to perform without ever knowing what the environment was sending as a message because the message came from the first animal's brain So this is the first demo I'm going to be very quick because I want to show you the latest But what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to press the left cage to basically get a reward He goes there and does it And the same time he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn't see any light and the second rat in 70 percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina Well we took this to a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that I showed you before and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine their brains synchronize their brains perfectly to get this virtual arm to move One monkey is controlling the x dimension the other monkey is controlling the y dimension But it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you ask one monkey to control x and y the other monkey to control y and z and the third one to control x and z and you make them all play the game together moving the arm in 3D into a target to get the famous Brazilian orange juice And they actually do The black dot is the average of all these brains working in parallel in real time That is the definition of a biological computer interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal Where is this going We have no idea We're just scientists We are paid to be children to basically go to the edge and discover what is out there But one thing I know: One day in a few decades when our grandchildren surf the Net just by thinking or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see or somebody speaks because of a brain-to-brain bypass some of you will remember that it all started on a winter afternoon in a Brazilian soccer field with an impossible kick Thank you Thank you Miguel thank you for sticking to your time I actually would have given you a couple more minutes because there are a couple of points we want to develop and of course clearly it seems that we need connected brains to figure out where this is going So let's connect all this together So if I'm understanding correctly one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse Miguel Nicolelis: No it's a little different No monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys They are getting a visual feedback in 2D but the task they have to accomplish is 3D They have to move an arm in three dimensions But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls And to get that thing done you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains but the ideal is three So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back so this adjusts dynamically but the global synchrony remains the same Now if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control like this guy is controlling x and y but he should be controlling now y and z instantaneously that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions So what I need to say is that no Turing machine no computer can predict what a brain net will do So we will absorb technology as part of us Technology will never absorb us It's simply impossible How many times have you tested this And how many times have you succeeded versus failed MN: Oh tens of times With the three monkeys Oh several times I wouldn't be able to talk about this here unless I had done it a few times And I forgot to mention because of time that just three weeks ago a European group just demonstrated the first man-to-man brain-to-brain connection And how does that play MN: There was one bit of information -- big ideas start in a humble way -- but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object all non-invasive technology So the first subject got a message like our rats a visual message and transmitted it to the second subject The second subject received a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex or a different pulse two different pulses In one pulse the subject saw something On the other pulse he saw something different And he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the Internet across continents Moderator: Wow Okay that's where we are going That's the next TED Talk at the next conference Miguel Nicolelis thank you MN: Thank you Bruno Thank you My students and I work on very tiny robots Now you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you're all very familiar with: an ant We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things We've all seen a group of ants or some version of that carting off your potato chip at a picnic for example But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants Well first of all how do we get the capabilities of an ant in a robot at the same size scale Well first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion and we need the sensors power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot And finally to make these things really functional we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things So I'll start with mobility Insects move around amazingly well This video is from UC Berkeley It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials which is what we traditionally use to make robots and soft materials Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water for example So one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very very small mechanisms So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side so really tiny The hard material here is silicon and the soft material is silicone rubber And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this store energy in the springs and then release it to jump So there's no motors on board this right now no power This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab graduate student with tweezers So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps So this is Aaron the graduate student in question with the tweezers and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high And it survives bounces on the table it's incredibly robust and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny Ultimately though we want to add motors to this too and we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors to eventually integrate onto small autonomous robots we're cheating and using magnets So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg and you can see the silicone rubber joints and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around by an external magnetic field So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale We have a really good model for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves We all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run But when I'm really small the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass which is what causes that bouncy motion So this guy doesn't work quite yet but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around So this is about a centimeter cubed a centimeter on a side so very tiny and we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second so 10 centimeters per second It's pretty quick for a little small guy and that's really only limited by our test setup But this gives you some idea of how it works right now We can also make 3D-printed versions of this that can climb over obstacles a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot We want sensing power control actuation all together and not everything needs to be bio-inspired So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac And in this case instead of magnets or muscles to move this around we use rockets So this is a micro-fabricated energetic material and we can create tiny pixels of this and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot and this robot then is going to jump when it senses an increase in light So the next video is one of my favorites So you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air And you'll see a big flash at the beginning and the robot tumbling through the air So there was that big flash and you can see the robot jumping up through the air So there's no tethers on this no wires connecting to this to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale Imagine the rubble that you get after a natural disaster like an earthquake Imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for survivors Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe so you don't get collapses like this which happened outside of Minneapolis in 2007 Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood Right Fantastic Voyage Isaac Asimov Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do and they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites in Africa and Australia So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots And we've made some advances so far but there's still a long way to go and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination Thanks very much We can cut violent deaths around the world by 50 percent in the next three decades All we have to do is drop killing by 2。3 percent a year and we'll hit that target You don't believe me Well the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can and so do I but only if we focus on our cities especially the most fragile ones You see I've been thinking about this a lot For the last 20 years I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict violence terrorism or some insidious combination of all I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo I've counted cadavers in Colombia in Haiti in Sri Lanka in Papua New Guinea You don't need to be on the front line though to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control right There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal But I want you to take a closer look and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities: Aleppo Bamako Caracas Erbil Mosul Tripoli Salvador Violence is migrating to the metropole And maybe this is to be expected right After all most people today they live in cities not the countryside Just 600 cities including 30 megacities account for two thirds of global GDP But when it comes to cities the conversation is dominated by the North that is North America Western Europe Australia and Japan where violence is actually at historic lows As a result city enthusiasts they talk about the triumph of the city of the creative classes and the mayors that will rule the world Now I hope that mayors do one day rule the world but you know the fact is we don't hear any conversation really about what is happening in the South And by South I mean Latin America Africa Asia where violence in some cases is accelerating where infrastructure is overstretched and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality Now some diplomats and development experts and specialists they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities and the fight for development whether you define that as eradicating poverty universal healthcare beating back climate change will be won or lost in the shantytowns slums and favelas of our cities I want to talk to you about four megarisks that I think will define fragility in our time and if we can get to grips with these I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem So let me start with some good news Fact is we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all-time low Now Gaza Syria Sudan Ukraine as ghastly as these conflicts are and they are horrific they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a 50-year-long secular decline What's more we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for centuries we've seen this incredible drop in murder especially in the West Most Northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago These two facts -- the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder -- are amongst the most extraordinary if unheralded accomplishments of human history and we should be really excited right Well yeah we should There's just one problem: These two scourges are still with us You see 525，000 people -- men women boys and girls -- die violently every single year Research I've been doing with Keith Krause and others has shown that between 50，000 and 60，000 people are dying in war zones violently The rest almost 500，000 people are dying outside of conflict zones In other words 10 times more people are dying outside of war than inside war What's more violence is moving south to Latin America and the Caribbean to parts of Central and Southern Africa and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia Forty of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in Latin America 13 in Brazil and the most dangerous of all it's San Pedro Sula Honduras' second city with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100，000 people That's 23 times the global average Now if violence is re-concentrating geographically it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography because when it comes to cities the world ain't flat like Thomas Friedman likes to say It's spiky The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history and it all happened so fast You all know the figures right There's 7。3 billion people in the world today; there will be 9。6 billion by 2050 But consider this one fact: In the 1800s one in 30 people lived in cities today it's one in two and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable The vast majority 90 percent will be happening in the South in cities of the South So urban geographers and demographers they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence no Tokyo with 35 million people is one of the largest and some might say safest urban metropolises in the world No it's the speed of urbanization that matters I call this turbo-urbanization and it's one of the key drivers of fragility When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities and you think about turbo-urbanization think about Karachi Karachi was about 500，000 people in 1947 a hustling bustling city Today it's 21 million people and apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia these cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s Now take a look at New York The Big Apple it took 150 years to get to eight million people São Paulo Mexico City took 15 to reach that same interval Now what do these medium large mega- and hypercities look like What is their profile Well for one thing they're young What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge Now this is actually a good news story It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch What it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones In some fragile cities 75 percent of the population is under the age of 30 Think about that: Three in four people are under 30 It's like Palo Alto on steroids in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old Ditto for Dhaka Dili and Kabul And Tokyo It's 46 Same for most Western European cities Now it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence That's one factor among many but youthfulness combined with unemployment lack of education and -- this is the kicker -- being male is a deadly proposition They're statistically correlated all those risk factors with youth and they tend to relate to increases in violence Now for those of you who are parents of teenage sons you know what I'm talking about right Just imagine your boy without any structure with those unruly friends of his out there cavorting about Now take away the parents take away the education limit the education possibilities sprinkle in a little bit of drugs alcohol and guns and sit back and watch the fireworks The implications are disconcerting Right here in Brazil the life expectancy is 73。6 years If you live in Rio I'm sorry shave off two right there But if you're young you're uneducated you lack employment you're black and you're male your life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country Okay so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities After all cities are hubs of innovation dynamism prosperity excitement connectivity They're where the smart people gather And those young people I just mentioned they're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before And this explosion the Internet and mobile technology means that the digital divide separating the North and the South between countries and within them is shrinking But as we've heard so many times these new technologies are dual-edged right Take the case of law enforcement Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens The future crime scenario it's here today and we've got to be careful We have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy But it's not just the cops who are innovating We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in local and global collective action and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution But most worrying of all are criminal gangs who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico where I've been working groups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media They're using it to recruit to sell their products to coerce to intimidate and to kill Violence is going virtual So this is just a partial sketch of a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation I mean there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time not least income inequality poverty climate change impunity But we're facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards If we're going to change course we need to start a conversation the Singapores the Kuala Lumpurs the Dubais the Shanghais We've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices of what works and what doesn't A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members offering tutoring education and in the process are helping incubate cease-fires and truces and we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador once the world's most violent city by 50 percent We can also focus on hot cities but also hot spots Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities Did you know that between one and two percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to 99 percent of violent crime Take the case of São Paulo where I've been working It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest and it did this by doubling down on information collection hot spot mapping and police reform and in the process it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years We also got to focus on those hot people It's tragic but being young unemployed uneducated male increases the risks of being killed and killing We have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children our youngest children and valorize them not stigmatize them There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston Jamaica and right here in Rio which is putting education employment recreation up front for these high-risk groups and as a result we're seeing violence going down in their communities We've also got to make our cities safer more inclusive and livable for all The fact is social cohesion matters Mobility matters in our cities We've got to get away from this model of segregation exclusion and cities with walls My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellín When I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s Medellín was the murder capital of the world but it changed course and it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle-class ones through a network of cable cars of public transport and first-class infrastructure and in the process it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades And finally there's technology Technology has enormous promise but also peril We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation and much of it coming from this room The police are engaging in predictive analytics Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions Even my own group is involved in developing applications to provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens But we need to be careful If I have one single message for you it's this: There is nothing inevitable about lethal violence and we can make our cities safer Folks we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime So I have just one question: What are we waiting for Thank you Let's go south All of you are actually going south This is the direction of south this way and if you go 8，000 kilometers out of the back of this room you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth the Pole itself Now I am not an explorer I'm not an environmentalist I'm actually just a survivor and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles And ladies and gentlemen we need to listen to what these places are telling us and if we don't we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth I have faced head-on these places and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me Antarctica is such a hopeful place It is protected by the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 In 1991 a 50-year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica and this agreement could be altered changed modified or even abandoned starting in the year 2041 Ladies and gentlemen people already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last 10 20 30，000 100，000 years Can they not join the dots and think Why is the ice actually melting the Antarctic and I have worked hard for the last 23 years on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the North does never happen cannot happen in the South Where did this all begin It began for me at the age of 11 Check out that haircut It's a bit odd And at the age of 11 I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles I found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties when I was at university That was a bit more inspiring And after years seven years of fundraising seven years of being told no seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling and psychiatric help eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history In this photograph we are standing in an area the size of the United States of America and we're on our own We have no radio communications no backup Beneath our feet 90 percent of all the world's ice 70 percent of all the world's fresh water We're standing on it This is the power of Antarctica On this journey we faced the danger of crevasses intense cold so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing your teeth can crack water can freeze in your eyes Let's just say it's a bit chilly And after 70 desperate days we arrive at the South Pole We had done it But something happened to me on that 70-day journey in 1986 that brought me here and it hurt My eyes changed color in 70 days through damage Our faces blistered out The skin ripped off and we wondered why And when we got home we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered Ultraviolet rays down hit the ice bounced back fried out the eyes ripped off our faces It was a bit of a shock -- -- and it started me thinking Sixty days every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean It was desperately cold again Here's me coming in from washing naked at -60 Celsius And if anybody ever says to you I am cold -- -- if they look like this they are cold definitely And 1，000 kilometers away from the safety of land disaster strikes The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history and we're 1，000 kilometers from safety The ice is crashing around us grinding and I'm thinking Are we going to die But something clicked in my head on this day as I realized we as a world are in a survival situation and that feeling has never gone away for 25 long years Back then we had to march or die And we're not some TV survivor program When things go wrong for us it's life or death and our brave African-American Daryl who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole his heel dropped off from frostbite 200 klicks out He must keep going he does and after 60 days on the ice we stood at the North Pole We had done it Yes I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles but it was our success And sadly on return home it was not all fun I became very low To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen I was empty lonely financially destroyed I was without hope but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau and he inspired me to take on the 2041 mission Being Jacques he gave me clear instructions: Engage the world leaders talk to industry and business and above all Rob inspire young people because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica For the world leaders we've been to every world Earth Summit all three of them with our brave yacht 2041 twice to Rio once in '92 once in 2012 and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht 13，000 kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about 2041 and about their environment For the last 11 years we have taken over 1，000 people people from industry and business women and men from companies students from all over the world down to Antarctica and during those missions we've managed to pull out over 1，500 tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica That took eight years and I'm so proud of it because we recycled all of it back here in South America I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum Here she is and my mum -- -- my mum is still recycling and as she is in her 100th year isn't that fantastic And when -- I love my mum But when Mum was born the population of our planet was only 1。8 billion people and talking in terms of billions we have taken young people from industry and business from India from China These are game-changing nations and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic Unbelievably we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East often for the first time they've represented their nations in Antarctica Fantastic people so inspired To look after Antarctica you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place form a relationship form a bond form some love It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica I can't tell you I feel so lucky and I've been 35 times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for Antarctica but for local issues back in their own nations Let's go back to where we began: the ice melt of the North and South Poles And it's not good news NASA informed us six months ago that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating Huge areas of ice -- look how big Antarctica is even compared to here -- Huge areas of ice are breaking off from Antarctica the size of small nations And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise it is definite by one meter in the next 100 years the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth It's going to happen and I've realized that the preservation of Antarctica and our survival here on Earth are linked And there is a very simple solution If we are using more renewable energy in the real world if we are being more efficient with the energy here running our energy mix in a cleaner way there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica It won't make financial sense and if we manage our energy better we also may be able to slow down maybe even stop this great ice melt that threatens us It's a big challenge and what is our response to it We've got to go back one last time and at the end of next year we will go back to the South Geographic Pole where we arrived 30 years ago on foot and retrace our steps of 1，600 kilometers but this time only using renewable energy to survive We will walk across those icecaps which far down below are melting hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue This is my son Barney He is coming with me He is committed to walking side by side with his father and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders I'm extremely proud of him Good on him Barney Ladies and gentlemen a survivor -- and I'm good -- a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go Whatever A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat We have 27 years to preserve the Antarctic We all own it We all have responsibility The fact that nobody owns it maybe means that we can succeed Antarctica is a moral line in the snow and on one side of that line we should fight fight hard for this one beautiful pristine place left alone on Earth I know it's possible We are going to do it And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe I've tried to live by them If you can do or dream you can begin it now for boldness has genius power and magic in it Good luck to you all Thank you very much When you grow up in a developing country like India as I did you instantly learn to get more value from limited resources and find creative ways to reuse what you already have Take Mansukh Prajapati a potter in India He has created a fridge made entirely of clay that consumes no electricity He can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days That's a cool invention literally In Africa if you run out of your cell phone battery don't panic You will find some resourceful entrepreneurs who can recharge your cell phone using bicycles And since we are in South America let's go to Lima in Peru a region with high humidity that receives only one inch of rainfall each year An engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard that absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water The Peruvians are amazing For the past seven years I have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in India China Africa and South America and they keep amazing me Many of them did not go to school They don't invent stuff in big R&amp;D labs The street is the lab Why do they do that Because they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted like capital and energy and basic services like healthcare and education are also scarce in those regions When external resources are scarce you have to go within yourself to tap the most abundant resource human ingenuity and use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources In India we call it Jugaad Jugaad is a Hindi word that means an improvised fix a clever solution born in adversity Jugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect but they create more value at lower cost For me the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions are like alchemists They can magically transform adversity into opportunity and turn something of less value into something of high value In other words they mastered the art of doing more with less which is the essence of frugal innovation Frugal innovation is the ability to create more economic and social value using fewer resources Frugal innovation is not about making do; it's about making things better Now I want to show you how across emerging markets entrepreneurs and companies are adopting frugal innovation on a larger scale to cost-effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people who may have little income but very high aspirations Let's first go to China where the country's largest I。T service provider Neusoft has developed a telemedicine solution to help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients in Chinese villages This solution is based on simple-to-use medical devices that less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics China desperately needs these frugal medical solutions because by 2050 it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens Now let's go to Kenya a country where half the population uses M-Pesa a mobile payment solution This is a great solution for the African continent because 80 percent of Africans don't have a bank account but what is exciting is that M-Pesa is now becoming the source of other disruptive business models in sectors like energy Take M-KOPA the home solar solution that comes literally in a box that has a solar rooftop panel three LED lights a solar radio and a cell phone charger The whole kit though costs 200 dollars which is too expensive for most Kenyans and this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable Today you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just 35 dollars and then pay off the rest by making a daily micro-payment of 45 cents using your mobile phone Once you've made 365 micro-payments the system is unlocked and you own the product and you start receiving clean free electricity This is an amazing solution for Kenya where 70 percent of people live off the grid This shows that with frugal innovation what matters is that you take what is most abundant mobile connectivity to deal with what is scarce which is energy With frugal innovation the global South is actually catching up and in some cases even leap-frogging the North Instead of building expensive hospitals China is using telemedicine to cost-effectively treat millions of patients and Africa instead of building banks and electricity grids is going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North I live in Silicon Valley where we keep chasing the next big technology thing Think of the iPhone 5 6 then 7 8 Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&amp;D and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products to differentiate their brands from competition and they charge customers more money for new features So the conventional business model in the West is more for more But sadly this more for more model is running out of gas for three reasons: First a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power can no longer afford these expensive products Second we are running out of natural water and oil In California where I live water scarcity is becoming a big problem And third most importantly because of the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class in the West there is a big disconnect between existing products and services and basic needs of customers Do you know that today there are over 70 million Americans today who are underbanked because existing banking services are not designed to address their basic needs The prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think that they are about to lose the high standard of living and face deprivation I believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West is if we learn to do more with less The good news is that's starting to happen Several Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation to create affordable products for Western consumers Let me give you two examples When I first saw this building I told myself it's some kind of postmodern house Actually it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone a joint venture between Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus and the food multinational Danone to make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh This factory is 10 percent the size of existing Danone factories and cost much less to build I guess you can call it a low-fat factory Now this factory unlike Western factories that are highly automated relies a lot on manual processes in order to generate jobs for local communities Danone was so inspired by this model that combines economic efficiency and social sustainability they are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well Now when you see this example you might be thinking Well frugal innovation is low tech Actually no Frugal innovation is also about making high tech more affordable and more accessible to more people Let me give you an example In China the R&amp;D engineers of Siemens Healthcare have designed a C。T scanner that is easy enough to be used by less qualified health workers like nurses and technicians This device can scan more patients on a daily basis and yet consumes less energy which is great for hospitals but it's also great for patients because it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent This solution was initially designed for the Chinese market but now it's selling like hotcakes in the U。S and Europe where hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost But the frugal innovation revolution in the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs who are coming up with amazing solutions to address basic needs in the U。S and Europe Let me quickly give you three examples of startups that personally inspire me The first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley It's called gThrive They make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers that farmers can stick in different parts of the field and start collecting detailed information like soil conditions This dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy while improving quality of the products and the yields which is a great solution for California which faces major water shortage It pays for itself within one year Second example is Be-Bound also in Silicon Valley that enables you to connect to the Internet even in no-bandwidth areas where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G How do they do that They simply use SMS a basic technology but that happens to be the most reliable and most widely available around the world Three billion people today with cell phones can't access the Internet This solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way And in France there is a startup calle Compte Nickel which is revolutionizing the banking sector It allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store and in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products: an international bank account number and an international debit card They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros That means you can do all banking transactions -- send and receive money pay with your debit card -- all with no additional charge This is what I call low-cost banking without the bank Amazingly 75 percent of the customers using this service are the middle-class French who can't afford high banking fees Now I talked about frugal innovation initially pioneered in the South now being adopted in the North Ultimately we would like to see developed countries and developing countries come together and co-create frugal solutions that benefit the entire humanity The exciting news is that's starting to happen Let's go to Nairobi to find that out Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams When I first saw them I thought Holy cow Literally because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi To ease the situation the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic which initially was designed by the Japanese engineers Unlike in the West Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors which are very expensive to install in Nairobi Instead they process images traffic data collected from a small number of low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets and then they use analytic software to predict congestion points and they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take Granted Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars but it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B at least 20 percent faster And earlier this year UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation which seeks to identify frugal healthcare solutions anywhere in the world that will be at least 20 percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U。S and yet more effective It also tries to bring together innovators from North and South to cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity I gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world but the question is how do you go about adopting frugal innovation Well I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world that I want to share with you that you can apply in your own organization The first principle is: Keep it simple Don't create solutions to impress customers Make them easy enough to use and widely accessible like the C。T scanner we saw in China Second principle: Do not reinvent the wheel Try to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available like using mobile telephony to offer clean energy or Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services Third principle is: Think and act horizontally Companies tend to scale up vertically by centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses but if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity you need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain with smaller manufacturing and distribution units like Grameen Bank has shown The South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity The North is now learning to do more and better with less as it faces resource constraints As an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States my hope is that we transcend this artificial North-South divide so that we can harness the collective ingenuity of innovators from around the world to cocreate frugal solutions that will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world while preserving our precious planet Thank you very much When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about 500 years ago they obviously found this amazing tropical forest And among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before they found one species that caught their attention very quickly This species when you cut the bark you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes The indigenous people called this species pau brasil and that's the reason why this land became land of Brasil and later on Brazil That's the only country in the world that has the name of a tree So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil among other reasons Forest products are all around us the forest is very important for climate regulation In Brazil almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere 20 billion tons of water every day This is more than what the Amazon River which is the largest river in the world puts in the sea per day which is 17 billion tons If we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world So it's a hell of a service for all of us We have in the world about four billion hectares of forests This is more or less China U。S。 Canada and Brazil all together in terms of size to have an idea Three quarters of that is in the temperate zone and just one quarter is in the tropics but this one quarter one billion hectares holds most of the biodiversity and very importantly 50 percent of the living biomass the carbon Now we used to have six billion hectares of forest -- 50 percent more than what we have -- 2，000 years ago We've actually lost two billion hectares in the last 2，000 years But in the last 100 years we lost half of that That was when we shifted from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests So think of this: In 100 years we lost the same amount of forest in the tropics that we lost in 2，000 years in temperate forests That's the speed of the destruction that we are having Now Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle We have the second largest forest in the world just after Russia It means 12 percent of all the world's forests are in Brazil most of that in the Amazon It's the largest piece of forest we have It's a very big large area You can see that you could fit many of the European countries there We still have 80 percent of the forest cover That's the good news But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years So if you go with that speed very soon we will loose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon that regulates our climate at the end of the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s Twenty-seven thousand square kilometers in one year This is 2。7 million hectares It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year So at this moment -- this is 2003 2004 -- I happened to be coming to work in the government And together with other teammates in the National Forest Department we were assigned a task to join a team and find out the causes of deforestation and make a plan to combat that at a national level involving the local governments the civil society business local communities in an effort that could tackle those causes So we came up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas Now I will go through all of them one by one -- no just giving some examples of what we had done in the next few years So the first thing we set up a system with the national space agency that could actually see where deforestation is happening almost in real time So now in Brazil we have this system where every month or every two months we get information on where deforestation is happening so we can actually act when it's happening And all the information is fully transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems This allows us among other things to apprehend 1。4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken Part of that we saw and sell and all the revenue becomes a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities as an endowment fund This also allows us to make a big operation to seize corruption and illegal activities that ended up having 700 people in prison including a lot of public servants Then we made the connection that areas that have been doing illegal deforestation should not get any kind of credit or finance So we cut this through the bank system and then linked this to the end users that buy products from illegal clear-cut areas they also can be liable for the deforestation So making all these connections to help to push the problem down And also we work a lot on land tenure issues It's very important for conflicts Fifty million hectares of protected areas were created which is an area the size of Spain And of those eight million were indigenous lands Now we start to see results So in the last 10 years deforestation came down in Brazil 75 percent So if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade we saved 8。7 million hectares which is the size of Austria But more importantly it avoided the emission This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until today as a positive action One may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease to push down deforestation because you will not have economic activity or something like that But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite In fact in the period when we have the deepest decline of deforestation the economy grew on average double from the previous decade when deforestation was actually going up So it's a good lesson for us Maybe this is completely disconnected as we just learned by having deforestation come down Now this is all good news and it's quite an achievement and we obviously should be very proud about that But it's not even close to sufficient In fact if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013 that was over half a million hectares which means that every minute an area the size of two soccer fields is being cut in the Amazon last year just last year If we sum up the deforestation we have in the other biomes in Brazil we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world It's more or less like we are forest heroes but still deforestation champions So we can't be satisfied not even close to satisfied So the next step I think is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil That's our next step between climate change and forests First because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation so it's a big part of the problem But also forests can be a big part of the solution since that's the best way we know to sink capture and store carbon Now there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in 2008 and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change I went to visit Canada in British Columbia together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them like Canada Russia India China U。S And when we were there we learned about this pine beetle we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in Canada What we see here those brown trees these are really dead trees They are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle What happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter For many years now they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change So I was thinking maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change by floods heat fires and so on So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change find a way to think and understand the challenge and go from there Now the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward The goal is very clear We want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees There are several reasons for that I will not get into that now But in order to get to this limit of two degrees which is possible for us to survive the IPCC the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines that we have a budget of emissions of 1，000 billion tons of CO2 So if we divide this by the number of years what we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year Now what is one ton of CO2 It's more or less what one small car running 20 kilometers a day will emit in one year Or it's one flight one way from São Paulo to Johannesburg or to London one way Two ways two tons So 11 billion tons is twice that Now the emissions today are 50 billion tons and it's growing It's growing and maybe it will be 61 by 2020 Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050 And while this happens the population will grow from seven to nine billion people the economy will grow from 60 trillion dollars in 2010 to 200 trillion dollars You have to choose You take the airplane or you have a car So the question is can we make it And that's the exactly the same question It's such a big problem so complex Can we really do it I think so Think of this: Deforestation means 60 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade Now it's a little bit less than 30 percent In the world 60 percent is energy So if we can tackle directly the energy the same way we could tackle deforestation maybe we can have a chance First we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions We don't need to clear-cut all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy That's what we proved when we decreased deforestation The economy continues to grow Same thing could happen in the energy sector Second we have to move the incentives to the right place Today 500 billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy Third we need to measure and make it transparent where when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so we can have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities Fourth we need to leapfrog the routes of development which means you don't need to go to the landline telephone Same way we don't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy we need to share responsibility between governments business and civil society There is work to do for everybody and we need to have everybody on board I think the future is not like a fate that you have to just go as business as usual goes We need to have the courage to actually change the route think that we can actually change the route I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world Thank you So over the past few centuries microscopes have revolutionized our world They revealed to us a tiny world of objects life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope a microscope for changes It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope to make small objects bigger but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way So what do I mean by color changes Our skin for example changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it That change is incredibly subtle which is why when you look at other people when you look at the person sitting next to you you don't see their skin or their face changing color When we look at this video of Steve here it appears to us like a static picture but once we look at this video through our new special microscope suddenly we see a completely different image What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin magnified 100 times so that they become visible We can actually see a human pulse We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse but also to actually recover our heart rates and measure our heart rates And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera and the heart rate measurement we get is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded We can do it essentially with other videos as well So I just took a short clip from Batman Begins here And you know presumably he's wearing makeup the lighting here is kind of challenging but still just from the video we're able to extract his pulse and show it quite well So how do we do all that We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded at every pixel in the video over time and then we crank up those changes We make them bigger so that we can see them The tricky part is that those signals those changes that we're after are extremely subtle so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them from noise that always exists in videos So we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video and then the way the color changes over time and then we amplify those changes We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos or magnified videos that actually show us those changes But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color but also tiny motions and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras will change not only if the color of the object changes but also if the object moves So this is my daughter when she was about two months old It's a video I recorded about three years ago And as new parents we all want to make sure our babies are healthy that they're breathing that they're alive of course So I too got one of those baby monitors so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor You can see the baby's sleeping but there's not too much information there There's not too much we can see Wouldn't it be better or more informative or more useful if instead we could look at the view like this So here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing Here is a side-by-side comparison So again in the source video in the original video there's not too much we can see but once we magnify the motions the breathing becomes much more visible And it turns out there's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies We can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion And that's actually my eye and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep Even when a person is sitting still there's a lot of information we can extract about their breathing patterns small facial expressions Maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions We can also magnify small mechanical movements like vibrations in engines that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways but measuring those motions is one thing and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole different thing And ever since we discovered this new technology we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it It's very simple to use It can work on your own videos where you can upload your videos and process them online so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples of what others have done with it So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85 I don't know who that user is but he or she used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy It's kind of creepy People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth that was motion-magnified You can also do some art with it So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale She wanted to see if there's any difference in the way her classmates move She made them all stand still and then magnified their motions It's like seeing still pictures come to life And the nice thing with all those examples is that we had nothing to do with them We just provided this new tool a new way to look at the world and then people find other interesting new and creative ways of using it But we didn't stop there This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way it also redefines what we can do and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras So as scientists we started wondering what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound Sound as we all know is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them which is how we hear and how we record sound But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions Those are motions that are not visible to us but are visible to a camera with the right processing So here are two examples This is me demonstrating my great singing skills And I took a high-speed video of my throat while I was humming Again if you stare at that video there's not too much you'll be able to see but once we magnify the motions 100 times we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound That signal is there in that video We also know that singers can break a wine glass if they hit the correct note So here we're going to play a note that's in the resonance frequency of that glass through a loudspeaker that's next to it Once we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound It's not something you're used to seeing every day But this made us think It gave us this crazy idea Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them In this way we can turn everyday objects into microphones So that's exactly what we did So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table and we're going to turn that bag of chips into a microphone by filming it with a video camera and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it So here's the sound that we played in the room And this is a high-speed video we recorded of that bag of chips Again it's playing There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that video I call it -- Thank you I call it the visual microphone We actually extract audio signals from video signals And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer That's one thousandth of a millimeter That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off objects and gets recorded by our cameras We can recover sounds from other objects like plants And we can recover speech as well So here's a person speaking in a room Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow Michael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered just from this video of that same bag of chips Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow MR: We used Mary Had a Little Lamb because those are said to be the first words that Thomas Edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877 It was one of the first sound recording devices in history It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder Here's a demonstration of recording and replaying sound with Edison's phonograph Voice: Testing testing one two three and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go Testing testing one two three Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow MR: And now 137 years later we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality is 15 feet away from the object behind soundproof glass Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow and everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go But it might actually be useful for other things as well Maybe in the future we'll be able to use it for example to recover sound across space because sound can't travel in space but light can We've only just begun exploring other possible uses for this new technology It lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now This is our team Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration with this great group of people you see here and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website try it out yourself and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions Thank you I'm a lexicographer I make dictionaries And my job as a lexicographer is to try to put all the words possible into the dictionary My job is not to decide what a word is; that is your job Everybody who speaks English decides together what's a word and what's not a word Every language is just a group of people who agree to understand each other Now sometimes when people are trying to decide whether a word is good or bad they don't really have a good reason So they say something like Because grammar I don't actually really care about grammar too much -- don't tell anybody But the word grammar actually there are two kinds of grammar There's the kind of grammar that lives inside your brain and if you're a native speaker of a language or a good speaker of a language it's the unconscious rules that you follow when you speak that language And this is what you learn when you learn a language as a child And here's an example: This is a wug right It's a wug Now there is another one There are two of these There are two 。。 Audience: Wugs Erin McKean: Exactly You know how to make the plural of wug That rule lives in your brain You never had to be taught this rule you just understand it This is an experiment that was invented by a professor at Boston University named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958 So we've been talking about this for a long time Now these kinds of natural rules that exist in your brain they're not like traffic laws they're more like laws of nature And nobody has to remind you to obey a law of nature right When you leave the house in the morning your mom doesn't say Hey honey I think it's going to be cold take a hoodie don't forget to obey the law of gravity Nobody says this Now there are other rules that are more about manners than they are about nature So you can think of a word as like a hat Once you know how hats work nobody has to tell you Don't wear hats on your feet What they have to tell you is Can you wear hats inside Who gets to wear a hat What are the kinds of hats you get to wear Those are more of the second kind of grammar which linguists often call usage as opposed to grammar Now sometimes people use this kind of rules-based grammar to discourage people from making up words And I think that is well stupid So for example people are always telling you Be creative make new music do art invent things science and technology But when it comes to words they're like Don't No Creativity stops right here whippersnappers Give it a rest But that makes no sense to me Words are great We should have more of them I want you to make as many new words as possible And I'm going to tell you six ways that you can use to make new words in English The first way is the simplest way Basically steal them from other languages Go rob other people Linguists call this borrowing but we never give the words back so I'm just going to be honest and call it stealing We usually take words for things that we like like delicious food We took kumquat from Chinese we took caramel from French We also take words for cool things like ninja right We took that from Japanese which is kind of a cool trick because ninjas are hard to steal from So another way that you can make words in English is by squishing two other English words together This is called compounding Words in English are like Lego: We do this all the time in English: Words like heartbroken bookworm sandcastle all are compounds So go ahead and make words like duckface just don't make duckface Another way that you can make words in English is kind of like compounding but instead you use so much force when you squish the words together that some parts fall off So these are blend words like brunch is a blend of breakfast and lunch Motel is a blend of motor and hotel Who here knew that motel was a blend word Yeah that word is so old in English that lots of people don't know that there are parts missing Edutainment is a blend of education and entertainment And of course electrocute is a blend of electric and execute You can also make words by changing how they operate This is called functional shift You take a word that acts as one part of speech and you change it into another part of speech Okay who here knew that friend hasn't always been a verb Friend used to be noun and then we verbed it Almost any word in English can be verbed You can also take adjectives and make them into nouns Commercial used to be an adjective and now it's a noun And of course you can green things Another way to make words in English is back-formation You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit So for example in English we had the word editor before we had the word edit Edit was formed from editor Sometimes these back-formations sound a little silly: Bulldozers bulldoze butlers butle and burglers burgle Another way to make words in English is to take the first letters of something and squish them together So National Aeronautics and Space Administration becomes NASA And of course you can do this with anything OMG So it doesn't matter how silly the words are They can be really good words of English Absquatulate is a perfectly good word of English Mugwump is a perfectly good word of English So the words don't have have to sound normal they can sound really silly Why should you make words You should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get your meaning across And new words grab people's attention They get people to focus on what you're saying and that gives you a better chance to get your meaning across A lot of people on this stage today have said In the future you can do this you can help with this you can help us explore you can help us invent You can make a new word right now English has no age limit Go ahead start making words today send them to me and I will put them in my online dictionary Wordnik Thank you so much The power of yet I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate and if they didn't pass a course they got the grade Not Yet And I thought that was fantastic because if you get a failing grade you think I'm nothing I'm nowhere But if you get the grade Not Yet you understand that you're on a learning curve It gives you a path into the future Not Yet also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career a real turning point I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty so I gave 10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way They said things like I love a challenge or You know I was hoping this would be informative They understood that their abilities could be developed They had what I call a growth mindset But other students felt it was tragic catastrophic From their more fixed mindset perspective their intelligence had been up for judgment and they failed Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet they were gripped in the tyranny of now So what do they do next I'll tell you what they do next In one study they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test In another study after a failure they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves And in study after study they have run from difficulty Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error On the left you see the fixed mindset students There's hardly any activity They run from the error They don't engage with it But on the right you have the students with the growth mindset the idea that abilities can be developed They engage deeply Their brain is on fire with yet They engage deeply They process the error They learn from it and they correct it How are we raising our children Are we raising them for now instead of yet Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A's Are we raising kids who don't know how to dream big dreams Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives Maybe because employers are coming to me and saying we have already raised a generation of young workers who can't get through the day So what can we do How can we build that bridge to yet Here are some things we can do First of all we can praise wisely not praising intelligence or talent That has failed Don't do that anymore But praising the process that kids engage in: their effort their strategies their focus their perseverance their improvement creates kids who are hardy and resilient There are other ways to reward yet We recently teamed up with game scientists to create a new online math game that rewarded yet In this game students were rewarded for effort strategy and progress The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now but this game rewarded process And we got more effort more strategies more engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance when they hit really really hard problems Just the words yet or not yet we're finding give kids greater confidence give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence And we can actually change students' mindsets In one study we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult the neurons in their brain can form new stronger connections and over time they can get smarter Look what happened: in this study students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades We have shown this now this kind of improvement with thousands and thousands of kids especially struggling students So let's talk about equality In our country there are groups of students who chronically underperform for example children in inner cities or children on Native American reservations And they've done so poorly for so long that many people think it's inevitable But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet equality happens And here are just a few examples In one year a kindergarten class in Harlem New York scored in the 95th percentile on the National Achievement Test Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school In one year fourth grade students in the South Bronx way behind became the number one fourth grade class in the state of New York on the state math test In a year to a year and a half Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top and that district included affluent sections of Seattle So the native kids outdid the Microsoft kids This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed Before effort and difficulty made them feel dumb made them feel like giving up but now effort and difficulty that's when their neurons are making new connections stronger connections That's when they're getting smarter I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy He said Dear Professor Dweck I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research and that's why I decided to put it into practice I put more effort into my schoolwork into my relationship with my family and into my relationship with kids at school and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas I now realize I've wasted most of my life Let's not waste any more lives because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth it becomes a basic human right for children all children to live in places that create that growth to live in places filled with yet Thank you It used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new you would have to program it requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal then this is going to be a great challenge So this was the challenge faced by this man Arthur Samuel In 1956 he wanted to get this computer lay out in excruciating detail how to be better than you at checkers So he came up with an idea: he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers And indeed it worked and in fact by 1962 this computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion So Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning and I have a great debt to him because I am a machine learning practitioner I was the president of Kaggle a community of over 200，000 machine learning practictioners Kaggle puts up competitions to try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems and it's been successful hundreds of times So from this vantage point I was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past can do today and what it could do in the future Google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm Since that time there have been many commercial successes of machine learning Companies like Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy movies that you might like to watch Sometimes it's almost creepy Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it These are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand This is also how IBM was successful in getting Watson to beat the two world champions at Jeopardy answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in 2003 We don't know how to write those programs by hand but with machine learning this is now possible And in fact this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads So we now know that computers can learn and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves or maybe can do them better than us One of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning happened on a project that I ran at Kaggle where a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton from the University of Toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery all of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community and they did it in two weeks How did they do this They used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning So important was this that in fact the success was covered This is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left-hand side and as a result it's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do the better it gets The New York Times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which I'm going to show you now It shows that computers can listen and understand Richard Rashid: Now the last step that I want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in Chinese Now the key thing there is and produce a text-to-speech system that takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language and we've used that to modulate Again the result's not perfect There are in fact quite a few errors There's much work to be done in this area Jeremy Howard: Well that was at a machine learning conference in China It's not often actually at academic conferences that you do hear spontaneous applause Everything you saw there was happening with deep learning Thank you The transcription in English was deep learning So deep learning is this extraordinary thing In this obscure competition from Germany called the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Not only could it recognize the traffic signs better than any other algorithm the leaderboard actually showed it was better than people about twice as good as people So by 2011 we had the first example of computers that can see better than people Since that time a lot has happened watch YouTube videos and crunched the data on 16，000 computers for a month just by watching the videos This is much like the way that humans learn Humans don't learn by being told what they see but by learning for themselves what these things are Also in 2012 Geoffrey Hinton who we saw earlier won the very popular ImageNet competition what they're pictures of As of 2014 we're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition This is better than people again So machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this and it is now being used in industry For example Google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in France in two hours and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers Imagine how long it would have taken before: dozens of people many years This is also happening in China Baidu is kind of the Chinese Google I guess and what you see here in the top left and found similar images The similar images actually have similar backgrounds similar directions of the faces even some with their tongue out This is not clearly looking at the text of a web page All I uploaded was an image So we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of hundreds of millions of images in real time So what does it mean now that computers can see Well it's not just that computers can see Complex nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms As you can see here this Stanford-based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment Deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things Also deep learning has been used to read Chinese again at about native Chinese speaker level This algorithm developed out of Switzerland by people none of whom speak or understand any Chinese As I say using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this even compared to native human understanding This is a system that we put together at my company which shows putting all this stuff together These are pictures which have no text attached and as I'm typing in here sentences in real time it's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing So you can see it's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures I know that you've seen something like this on Google where you can type in things and it will show you pictures but actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text This is very different from actually understanding the images This is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months and of course we've shown that they can understand what they hear Perhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write Here is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday Each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures This algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar It's seen a man before it's seen black before it's seen a guitar before but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture In tests humans prefer the computer-generated caption one out of four times Now this system is now only two weeks old so probably within the next year the computer algorithm will be well past human performance at the rate things are going So computers can also write So we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities For example in medicine a team in Boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer Very similarly in Stanford a group there announced that looking at tissues under magnification they've developed a machine learning-based system which in fact is better than human pathologists at predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers but they generated new insightful science In the radiology case they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand In this pathology case the computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer are as important as the cancer cells themselves in making a diagnosis This is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades In each of those two cases they were systems developed by a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts but as of last year we're now beyond that too This is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope or about as accurately as human pathologists but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field Similarly here this neuron segmentation We can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine So myself as somebody with no previous background in medicine I seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company which I did I was kind of terrified of doing it but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques And thankfully the feedback has been fantastic not just from the media but from the medical community who have been very supportive The theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible leaving doctors to do what they're best at I want to give you an example It now takes us about 15 minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and I'll show you that in real time now but I've compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out Rather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test I'm going to show you a diagnostic test of car images because that's something we can all understand So here we're starting with about 1。5 million car images and I want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that's being taken So these images are entirely unlabeled so I have to start from scratch With our deep learning algorithm it can automatically identify areas of structure in these images So the human as you can see here is telling the computer about areas of interest Now these deep learning systems actually are in 16，000-dimensional space so you can see here the computer rotating this through that space trying to find new areas of structure And when it does so successfully So here the computer has successfully found areas for example angles So as we go through this process we're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we're looking for You can imagine in a diagnostic test this would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis for example or a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules And sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm In this case it got kind of confused The fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up So here we have to be a bit more careful manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs then telling the computer that this is a type of group that we're interested in So we do that for a while we skip over a little bit and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things and we hope that it's gotten a lot better You can see it's now started to fade some of these pictures out Sometimes of course even at this point it's still difficult to separate out groups In this case even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while are all mixed up together So we can again give the computer some hints using this deep learning algorithm And giving it that hint -- ah okay it's been successful that's separated out these together So you get the idea here but where they're working together of five or six people about seven years and replacing it with something that takes 15 minutes for one person acting alone So this process takes about four or five iterations You can see we now have 62 percent of our 1。5 million images classified correctly grab whole big sections Where there are mistakes we can let the computer know about them And using this kind of process for each of the different groups we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1。5 million images And at this point it's just a case and trying to understand why And using that approach by 15 minutes we get to 97 percent classification rates which is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world The World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x shortage of physicians in the developing world and it would take about 300 years So imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches So I'm very excited about the opportunities I'm also concerned about the problems The problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment What are services These are services These are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do So 80 percent of the world's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do What does that mean Well it'll be fine They'll be replaced by other jobs For example there will be more jobs for data scientists Well not really It doesn't take data scientists very long to build these things For example these four algorithms were all built by the same guy So if you think oh it's all happened before we've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs what are these new jobs going to be It's very hard for us to estimate this because human performance grows at this gradual rate but we now have a system deep learning that we know actually grows in capability exponentially And we're here So currently we see the things around us and we say Oh computers are still pretty dumb Right But in five years' time computers will be off this chart So we need to be starting to think about this capability right now We have seen this once before of course In the Industrial Revolution we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines The thing is though that after a while things flattened out There was social disruption but once engines were used to generate power in all the situations things really settled down The Machine Learning Revolution is going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution because the Machine Learning Revolution it never settles down The better computers get at intellectual activities so this is going to be a kind of change that the world has actually never experienced before so your previous understanding of what's possible is different This is already impacting us In the last 25 years as capital productivity has increased labor productivity has been flat in fact even a little bit down So I want us to start having this discussion now I know that when I often tell people about this situation people can be quite dismissive Well computers can't really think they don't emote they don't understand poetry we don't really understand how they work So what Computers right now can do the things that humans spend most of their time being paid to do so now's the time to start thinking about how we're going to adjust our social structures and economic structures to be aware of this new reality Thank you I was on a long road trip this summer and I was having a wonderful time listening It documents six million black folks fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970 looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up North and it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of African-Americans and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility and all the humiliations It was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men And I said You know this is a little deep I need a break I'm going to turn on the radio I turned it on and there it was: Ferguson Missouri Michael Brown 18-year-old black man unarmed shot by a white police officer laid on the ground dead blood running for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror and I thought here it is again This violence this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries I mean it's the same story It's just different names It could have been Amadou Diallo It could have been Sean Bell It could have been Oscar Grant It could have been Trayvon Martin This violence this brutality is really something that's part of our national psyche It's part of our collective history What are we going to do about it You know that part of us that still crosses the street locks the doors clutches the purses when we see young black men That part I mean I know we're not shooting people down in the street but I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents are in us We've been schooled in them as well I believe that we can stop these types of incidents these Fergusons from happening by looking within and being willing to change ourselves So I have a call to action for you There are three things that I want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop Ferguson from happening again; three things that I think will help us reform our images of young black men; three things that I'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world so that they can thrive Can you imagine that Can you imagine our country embracing young black men seeing them as part of our future giving them that kind of openness that kind of grace we give to people we love How much better would our lives be How much better would our country be Let me just start with number one We gotta get out of denial Stop trying to be good people We need real people You know I do a lot of diversity work and people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop They're like Oh Ms Diversity Lady we're so glad you're here -- -- but we don't have a biased bone in our body And I'm like Really Because I do this work every day and I see all my biases I mean not too long ago I was on a plane and I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P。A system and I was just so excited so thrilled I was like Yes women we are rocking it We are now in the stratosphere It was all good and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy and I was like I hope she can drive I know Right But it's not even like I knew that was a bias until I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving and it's often turbulent and bumpy and I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver The pilot is good Now here's the problem If you ask me explicitly I would say Female pilot: awesome But it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome a little risky I lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had You know fast-moving planes in the sky I want a guy That's my default Men are my default Who is your default Who do you trust Who are you afraid of Who do you implicitly feel connected to Who do you run away from I'm going to tell you what we have learned The implicit association test which measures unconscious bias you can go online and take it Five million people have taken it Turns out our default is white We like white people We prefer white What do I mean by that When people are shown images of black men and white men we are more quickly able to associate that picture with a positive word that white person with a positive word than we are when we are trying to associate positive with a black face and vice versa When we see a black face it is easier for us to connect black with negative than it is white with negative Seventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white Fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white You see we were all outside when the contamination came down What do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates You know one of the things that you probably are thinking about and you're probably like you know what I'm just going to double down on my color blindness Yes I'm going to recommit to that I'm going to suggest to you no We've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color The problem was never that we saw color It was what we did when we saw the color It's a false ideal And while we're busy pretending not to see we are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference is changing people's possibilities that's keeping them from thriving and sometimes it's causing them an early death So in fact what the scientists are telling us is no way Don't even think about color blindness In fact what they're suggesting is stare at awesome black people Look at them directly in their faces and memorize them because when we look at awesome folks who are black it helps to dissociate the association that happens automatically in our brain Why do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me There were so many I had to cut them Okay so here's the thing: I'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are I'm trying to remind you that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and made them better So here's the thing The other possibility in science and it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions but one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious that you know and stick it up next to a person of color a black person who is fabulous then that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell Just stare at them right But these are the things So go looking for your bias Please please just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong Okay so that's number one: number two what I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them It's not the hardest thing to do but it's also one of these things where you have to be conscious and intentional about it You know I was in a Wall Street area one time several years ago when I was with a colleague of mine and she's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color she's Korean And we were outside it was late at night and we were sort of wondering where we were going we were lost And I saw this person across the street and I was thinking Oh great black guy I was going toward him without even thinking about it And she was like Oh that's interesting The guy across the street he was a black guy I think black guys generally know where they're going I don't know why exactly I think that but that's what I think So she was saying Oh you were going 'Yay a black guy' She said I was going 'Ooh a black guy。' Other direction Same need same guy same clothes same time same street different reaction And she said I feel so bad I'm a diversity consultant I did the black guy thing I'm a woman of color Oh my God And I said You know what Please We really need to relax about this I mean you've got to realize I go way back with black guys My dad is a black guy You see what I'm saying I've got a 6'5 black guy son I was married to a black guy My black guy thing is so wide and so deep that I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is and he was my black guy He said Yes ladies I know where you're going I'll take you there You know biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are But how are we going to know who they are when we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them So I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort And I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks I'm saying just do an inventory expand your social and professional circles Who's in your circle Who's missing How many authentic relationships do you have with young black people folks men women Or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll so to speak Because you know what Just look around your periphery There may be somebody at work in your classroom in your house of worship somewhere there's some black young guy there And you're nice You say hi I'm saying go deeper closer further and build the kinds of relationships the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes I know some of you are out there I know because I have some white friends in particular that will say You have no idea how awkward I am Like I don't think this is going to work for me I'm sure I'm going to blow this Okay maybe but this thing is not about perfection It's about connection And you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable I mean you just have to do it And young black men what I'm saying is if someone comes your way genuinely and authentically take the invitation Not everyone is out to get you Go looking for those people who can see your humanity You know it's the empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you Something really powerful and beautiful happens: you start to realize that they are you that they are part of you that they are you in your family and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors we become advocates and we become allies So go away from your comfort into a bigger brighter thing because that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening That's how we create a community where everybody especially young black men can thrive So this last thing is going to be harder and I know it but I'm just going to put it out there anyway When we see something we have to have the courage to say something even to the people we love You know it's holidays and it's going to be a time when we're sitting around the table and having a good time Many of us anyways will be in holidays and you've got to listen to the conversations around the table You start to say things like Grandma's a bigot Uncle Joe is racist And you know we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe We do We know they're good people but what they're saying is wrong And we need to be able to say something because you know who else is at the table The children are at the table And we wonder why these biases don't die and move from generation to generation Because we're not saying anything We've got to be willing to say Grandma we don't call people that anymore Uncle Joe it isn't true that he deserved that No one deserves that And we've got to be willing to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don't have the luxury to do so especially those who have young black sons We've got to take our lovely darlings our future and we've got to tell them we have an amazing country with incredible ideals we have worked incredibly hard and we have made some progress but we are not done We still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations and it is making for despair and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men We still struggle you have to tell them with seeing both the color and the character of young black men but that you and you expect them to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing above all other things to make a society where young black men can be seen for all of who they are So many amazing black men those who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived brave soldiers awesome hardworking laborers These are people who are powerful preachers They are incredible scientists and artists and writers They are dynamic comedians They are doting grandpas caring sons They are strong fathers and they are young men with dreams of their own Thank you The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson Missouri in the wake of the police shooting of Michael Brown underscored the extent to which advanced military weapons and equipment designed for the battlefield are making their way to small-town police departments across the United States Although much tougher to observe this same thing is happening with surveillance equipment NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible Location information can be very sensitive If you drive your car around the United States it can reveal if you go to a therapist attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting if you go to church or if you don't go to church And when that information about you is combined with the same information about everyone else the government can gain a detailed portrait of how private citizens interact This information used to be private Thanks to modern technology the government knows far too much about what happens behind closed doors And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are based on this information is the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader If you haven't seen one it's probably because you didn't know what to look for -- they're everywhere Mounted on roads or on police cars Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing But more than that increasingly local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing but of every plate that passes them by resulting in the collection of mass quantities of data about where Americans have gone Did you know this was happening When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department for information about the plate reader data they had on him this is what they got: in addition to the date time and location the police department had photographs that captured where he was going and often who he was with The second photo from the top is a picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway The government has hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life And if you drive a car in the United States I would bet money that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life Mike hasn't done anything wrong Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information The reason it's happening is because as the cost of storing this data has plummeted the police departments simply hang on to it just in case it could be useful someday The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in isolation or even that multiple police departments are doing it At the same time the federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data and pooling them together into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits showing where Americans have traveled This document from the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this is one of several that reveal the existence of this database Meanwhile in New York City the NYPD has driven police cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is attending The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States In the U。K。 the police department after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a bench and sketch the attendees License plate readers aren't the only mass location tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today Through a technique known as a cell tower dump law enforcement agents can uncover who was using one or more cell towers at a particular time a technique which has been known to reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there And if they don't know which house to target they've been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech surveillance gear Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not there The question is what should we do about this I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat History has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data tracking the movements of innocent people it gets abused maybe for blackmail maybe for political advantage or maybe for simple voyeurism Fortunately there are steps we can take Local police departments can be governed by the city councils which can pass laws requiring the police to dispose of the data about innocent people while allowing the legitimate uses of the technology to go forward Thank you Thank you I have only got 18 minutes so I'd better get started Let's start with a clip from Al Jazeera's Listening Post Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that gets relatively little media coverage Even the elections this past week passed without much drama And that's the Norwegian media in a nutshell: not much drama A few years back Norway's public TV channel NRK decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven-hour train ride -- seven hours of simple footage a train rolling down the tracks Norwegians more than a million of them according to the ratings loved it A new kind of reality TV show was born and it goes against all the rules of TV engagement There is no story line no script no drama no climax and it's called Slow TV For the past two months Norwegians have been watching a cruise ship's journey up the coast and there's a lot of fog on that coast Executives at Norway's National Broadcasting Service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide On the surface it sounds boring because it is but something about this TV experiment has gripped Norwegians to find out what it is but first a warning: Viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing Thomas Hellum: And then follows an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera about some strange TV programs in little Norway Al Jazeera CNN How did we get there We have to go back to 2009 when one of my colleagues got a great idea Where do you get your ideas In the lunchroom So he said why don't we make a radio program marking the day of the German invasion of Norway in 1940 We tell the story at the exact time during the night Wow Brilliant idea except this was just a couple of weeks before the invasion day So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed what other stories can you tell as they evolve What other things take a really long time So one of us came up with a train The Bergen Railway had its 100-year anniversary that year It goes from western Norway to eastern Norway and it takes exactly the same time as it did 40 years ago over seven hours So we caught our commissioning editors in Oslo and we said we want to make a documentary about the Bergen Railway and we want to make it in full length and the answer was Yes but how long will the program be Oh we said full length Yes but we mean the program And back and forth Luckily for us they met us with laughter very very good laughter so one bright day in September we started a program that we thought should be seven hours and four minutes Actually it turned out to be seven hours and 14 minutes due to a signal failure at the last station We had four cameras three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature I'm talking to the guests some information Train announcement: We will arrive at Haugastøl Station TH: And that's about it but of course also the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives Narrator in Norwegian: Then a bit of flirting while the food is digested The last downhill stretch before we reach our destination We pass Mjølfjell Station Then a new tunnel TH: And now we thought yes we have a brilliant program It will fit for the 2，000 train spotters in Norway We brought it on air in November 2009 But no this was far more attractive This is the five biggest TV channels in Norway on a normal Friday and if you look at NRK2 over here look what happened when they put on the Bergen Railway show: 1。2 million Norwegians watched part of this program And another funny thing: when the host on our main channel after they have good news for you she said And on our second channel the train has now nearly reached Myrdal station Thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this This was also a huge success in terms of social media It was so nice to see all the thousands of Facebook and Twitter users discussing the same view talking to each other as if they were on the same train together And especially I like this one It's a 76-year-old man He's watched all the program and at the end station he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage and his head hit the curtain rod and he realized he is in his own living room So that's strong and living TV Four hundred and thirty-six minute by minute on a Friday night and during that first night the first Twitter message came: Why be a chicken Why stop at 436 when you can expand that to 8，040 minute by minute and do the iconic journey in Norway the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten from Bergen to Kirkenes almost 3，000 kilometers covering most of our coast It has 120-year-old very interesting history and literally takes part in life and death along the coast So just a week after the Bergen Railway we called the Hurtigruten company and we started planning for our next show We wanted to do something different The Bergen Railway was a recorded program So when we sat in our editing room we saw this journalist We had called him we had spoken to him and when we left the station he took this picture of us and he waved to the camera and we thought what if more people knew that we were on board that train Would more people show up What would it look like So we decided our next project it should be live We wanted this picture of us on the fjord and on the screen at the same time So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship This is back in 1964 when the technical managers have suits and ties and NRK rolled all its equipment on board a ship and 200 meters out of the shore transmitting the signal back and in the machine room they talked to the machine guy and on the deck they have splendid entertainment So being on a ship it's not the first time But five and a half days in a row and live we wanted some help And we asked our viewers out there what do you want to see What do you want us to film How do you want this to look Do you want us to make a website What do you want on it And we got some answers from you out there and it helped us a very lot to build the program So in June 2011 23 of us went on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship and we set off I have some really strong memories from that week and it's all about people This guy for instance he's head of research at the University in Tromsø And I will show you a piece of cloth this one It's the other strong memory It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program and together with thousands of others along the route they made the program what it became They made all the stories This is Karl He's in the ninth grade It says I will be a little late for school tomorrow He was supposed to be in the school at 8 a。m He came at 9 a。m。 and he didn't get a note from his teacher because the teacher had watched the program How did we do this Yes we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten We turned it into a complete TV control room We made it all work of course and then we took along 11 cameras This is one of them This is my sketch from February and when you give this sketch to professional people in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK you get some cool stuff back And with some very creative solutions Narrator in Norwegian: Run it up and down This is Norway's most important drill right now It regulates the height of a bow camera in NRK's live production one of 11 that capture great shots from the MS Nord-Norge Eight wires keep the camera stable Cameraman: I work on different camera solutions They're just tools used in a different context TH: Another camera is this one It's normally used for sports It made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away like this one People called us and asked how is this man doing He's doing fine Everything went well We also could take pictures of people waving at us people along the route thousands of them and they all had a phone in their hand And when you take a picture of them and they get the message Now we are on TV dad they start waving back This was waving TV for five and a half days and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones It was also a great success on social media On the last day we met Her Majesty the Queen of Norway and Twitter couldn't quite handle it And we also on the web during this week we streamed more than 100 years of video to 148 nations and the websites are still there and they will be forever actually because Hurtigruten was selected to be part of the Norwegian UNESCO list of documents and it's also in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest documentary ever Thank you But it's a long program so some watched part of it like the Prime Minister Some watched a little bit more It says I haven't used my bed for five days And he's 82 years old and he hardly slept He kept watching because something might happen though it probably won't This is the number of viewers along the route You can see the famous Trollfjord and a day after all-time high for NRK2 If you see the four biggest channels in Norway during June 2011 they will look like this and as a TV producer it's a pleasure to put Hurtigruten on top of it It looks like this: 3。2 million Norwegians watched part of this program and we are only five million here Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship -- -- they chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees So we were allowed to be part of people's living room with this strange TV program with music nature people And Slow TV was now a buzzword and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about So we could either take something long and make it a topic like with the railway and the Hurtigruten or we could take a topic and make it long This is the last project It's the peep show It's 14 hours of birdwatching on a TV screen actually 87 days on the web We have made 18 hours of live salmon fishing It actually took three hours before we got the first fish and that's quite slow We have made 12 hours of boat ride into the beautiful Telemark Canal and we have made another train ride with the northern railway just to give the viewer another experience on the way So our next project got us some attention outside Norway This is from the Colbert Report on Comedy Central Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye on a wildly popular program from Norway called National Firewood Night which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace It destroyed the other top Norwegian shows like So You Think You Can Watch Paint Dry and The Amazing Glacier Race And get this almost 20 percent of the Norwegian population tuned in 20 percent TH: So when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting why not knitting So on our next project we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show he liked that Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people on the show are falling asleep and after all that the knitters actually failed to break the world record They did not succeed but remember the old Norwegian saying it's not whether you win or lose that counts In fact nothing counts and death is coming for us all TH: Exactly So why does this stand out This is so completely different to other TV programming We take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there actually being on the train on the boat and knitting together with others and the reason I think why they're doing that is because we don't edit the timeline It's important that we don't edit the timeline and it's also important that what we make Slow TV about is something that we all can relate to that the viewer can relate to and that somehow has a root in our culture This is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks And of course this is a lot of planning this is a lot of logistics So this is the working plan for 150 people last summer but more important is what you don't plan You don't plan what's going to happen You have to just take your cameras with you It's like a sports event You rig them and you see what's happening So this is actually the whole running order for Hurtigruten 134 hours just written on one page We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves and I'll give you an example of that This is from last summer and as a TV producer it's a nice picture but now you can cut to the next one But this is Slow TV so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach and then you keep it a little bit longer and when you keep it that long I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow Some of you have seen the flag Some of you start wondering is the farmer at home Has he left Are you watching the cow And where is that cow going So my point is the longer you keep a picture like this and we kept it for 10 minutes you start making the stories in your own head That's Slow TV So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story and we think that we can continue doing it not too often once or twice a year so we keep the feeling of an event and we also think that the good Slow TV idea that's the idea when people say Oh no you can't put that on TV When people smile it might be a very good slow idea so after all life is best when it's a bit strange Thank you on February 1 this year Independence Square was under siege surrounded by police loyal to the government The protesters who occupied Maidan as the square is known prepared for battle stockpiling homemade weapons and mass-producing improvised body armor The Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013 after the president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych rejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia In response tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance As the months passed I set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street There I photographed the fighters against a black curtain a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop of fire ice and smoke In order to tell the individual human stories here I felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media What I was witnessing was not only news but also history With this realization I was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine with ordinary lives from ordinary towns But the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in were quite extraordinary I say the word costume because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone They were improvised uniforms made up of decommissioned military equipment irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves this outward expression of masculinity the ideal of the warrior I worked slowly using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter The process is old-fashioned It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them in silence while they look back at me Rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on February 20 which became known as Bloody Thursday Snipers loyal to the government started firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street Many were killed in a very short space of time The reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue There were lines of bodies laid in the street And there was blood all over the pavements The following day President Yanukovych fled Ukraine In all three months of protests resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead and many more missing History unfolded quickly but celebration remained elusive in Maidan As the days passed in Kiev's central square streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people Many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead They came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers Sadness enveloped Maidan It was quiet and I could hear the birds singing I hadn't heard that before I stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture Most women cried when I photographed them On the first day my fixer Emine and I cried with almost every woman who visited our studio There had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point And the color of their pastel coats their shiny handbags and the bunches of red carnations white tulips and yellow roses that they carried jarred with the blackened square and the blackened men who were encamped there It is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don't make much sense without the other They are about men and women and the way we are -- not the way we look but the way we are They speak about different gender roles in conflict not only in Maidan and not only in Ukraine Men fight most wars and women mourn them If the men showed the ideal of the warrior then the women showed the implications of such violence When I made these pictures I believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine But now I understand that it is a record of the beginning while hundreds of thousands have been displaced I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago In Maidan the barricades have been dismantled and the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced so that traffic flows freely through the center of the square The fighters the women and the flowers are gone A huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field covers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building and proclaims Glory to Ukraine Glory to heroes Thank you So I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today and I decided to say Colombia And the reason I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil It's a beautiful country with extraordinary people like me and others -- -- and it's populated with incredible fauna flora It's got water; it's got everything to be the perfect place But we have a few problems You may have heard of some of them We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world It's been around for over 50 years which means that in my lifetime I have never lived one day of peace in my country This guerrilla -- and the main group is the FARC guerrillas Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- they have financed their war by kidnapping by extortion by getting into the drug trade by illegal mining There has been terrorism There have been random bombs So it's not good It's not really good And if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years we have had more than 5。7 million displaced population It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world and this conflict has cost over 220，000 lives So it's a little bit like the Bolívar wars again It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily We are now in the middle of peace talks and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully and as part of that we decided to try something completely lateral and different: Christmas lights So Christmas lights and you're saying what the hell is this guy going to talk about I am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic pathways in the jungle covered with Christmas lights These trees helped us demobilize 331 guerrillas roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time These trees were lit up at night and they had a sign beside them that said If Christmas can come to the jungle you can come home Demobilize At Christmas everything is possible So how do we know these trees worked Well we got 331 which is okay but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas So let me take you back four years before the trees Four years before the trees we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle The government had a military strategy it had a legal strategy it had a political strategy but it said We don't really have a communications strategy and it probably would be a good thing to have so we decided to immediately jump into this because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do with the tools that we have But we didn't know very much about it We didn't understand in Colombia if you live in the cities you're very far away from where the war is actually happening so you don't really understand it and we asked the government to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible And we talked to about 60 of them before we felt we fully understood the problem We talked about -- they told us why they had joined the guerrillas why the left the guerrillas what their dreams were what their frustrations were and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage And at the beginning we were so touched by these stories we were so amazed by these stories that we thought that maybe the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories their stories or stories similar to theirs and when they heard them they decided to go out I want to tell you one of these stories This person you see here is Giovanni Andres Giovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture He had been seven years in the guerrilla and he had demobilized very recently His story is the following: He was recruited when he was 17 and sometime later in his squadron if you will this beautiful girl was recruited and they fell in love Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like what their kids' names would be how their life would be when they left the guerrilla But it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla so their romance was discovered and they were separated He was sent very far away and she was left behind She was very familiar with the territory so one night when she was on guard she just left and she went to the army she demobilized and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to and we were really touched by this story so we made a radio spot and it turns out by chance that far away many many kilometers north he heard her on the radio and when he heard her on the radio he said What am I doing here She had the balls to get out I need to do the same thing And he did He walked for two days and two nights and he risked his life and he got out and the only thing he wanted was to see her The only thing that was in his mind was to see her The story was they did meet I know you're wondering if they did meet They did meet She had been recruited when she was 15 and she left when she was 17 so there were a lot of other complications but they did eventually meet I don't know if they're together now but I can find out But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla It was not working with the commanders the people that are more difficult to replace because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders So we thought well we'll use the same strategy We'll have commanders talking to commanders And we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them There is a better life out there I'm doing good This is not worth it etc But as you can all imagine it was very easy to counteract because what was the guerrilla going to say Yeah right if he doesn't do that he's going to get killed So it was easy so we were suddenly left with nothing because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don't do it they're in danger And somebody some brilliant person in our team came back and said You know what I noticed I noticed that around Christmastime there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started And that was incredible because that led us to think that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier We needed to step away from talking from government to army from army to army and we needed to talk about the universal values and we needed to talk about humanity And that was when the Christmas tree happened This picture that I have here you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez Captain Valdez was the first high-ranking official to give us the helicopters and the support we needed to put these Christmas trees up and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget He said I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger makes my men feel stronger And I get very emotional when I remember him because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him but I wanted you all to see him because he was really really important He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the Christmas tree operation and all of that said That's really good Christmas trees are really cool but you know what We really don't walk anymore We use rivers So rivers are the highways of the jungle and this is something we learned and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages So we went to these river villages and we asked the people and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas We asked them Can you send guerrillas a message We collected over 6，000 messages Some of them were notes saying get out Some of them were toys Some of them were candy Even people took off their jewelry their little crosses and religious things and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers so that they could be picked up at night And we sent thousands of these down the rivers and then picked them up later if they weren't But lots of them were picked up This generated on average a demobilization every six hours so this was incredible and it was about: Come home at Christmas Then came the peace process and when the peace process started the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed And it changed because it makes you think Well if there's a peace process this is probably going to be over At some point I'm going to get out And their fears completely changed and their fears were not about Am I going to get killed Their fears were Am I going to be rejected When I get out of this am I going to be rejected So the past Christmas what we did was we asked -- we found 27 mothers of guerrillas and we asked them to give us pictures of their children when they only could recognize themselves so as not to put their lives in danger and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get which is Before you were a guerrilla you were my child so come home I'm waiting for you You can see the pictures here I'll show you a couple Thank you And these pictures were placed in many different places and a lot of them came back and it was really really beautiful And then we decided to work with society So we did mothers around Christmastime Now let's talk about the rest of the people And you may be aware of this or not but there was a World Cup this year and Colombia played really well and it was a unifying moment for Colombia And what we did was tell the guerrillas Come get out of the jungle We're saving a place for you So this was television this was all different types of media saying We are saving a place for you The soldier here in the commercial says I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup Ex-football players radio announcers everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla So since we started this work a little over eight years ago 17，000 guerrillas have demobilized I do not -- Thank you I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision If that is true advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change that we have available And I speak not only my behalf but on behalf of all the colleagues I see here who work in advertising and of all the team that has worked with me to do this that if you want to change the world or if you want to achieve peace please call us We'd love to help Thank you 2014 is a very special year for me: 20 years as a consultant 20 years of marriage and I'm turning 50 in one month That means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany It was a gray November day and I was overdue The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day As a matter of fact 1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany: more than 1。3 million Last year we just hit over 600，000 so half of my number What you can see here is the German age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that's me In red you can see the potential working-age population so people over 15 and under 65 and I'm actually only interested in this red area Now let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years As you can see the peak is moving to the right and I with many other baby boomers will retire in 2030 By the way I don't need any forecasts of birth rates for predicting this red area The red area so the potential working-age population in 2030 is already set in stone today except for much higher migration rates And if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014 it is much much smaller So before I show you the rest of the world what does this mean for Germany So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply so people who provide labor will go down in Germany and will go down significantly Now what about labor demand That's where it gets tricky As you might know the consultant's favorite answer to any question is It depends So I would say it depends We didn't want to forecast the future Highly speculative We did something else We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last 20 years and calculated the following scenario: if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth And this is the green line: labor demand So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly Eight million people are missing which is more than 20 percent of our current workforce so big numbers really big numbers And we calculated several scenarios and the picture always looked like this Now to close the gap Germany has to significantly increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year and all these measures at once If Germany fails here Germany will stagnate We won't grow anymore Why Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth And companies will look for talents somewhere else But where Now we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest 15 economies in the world representing more than 70 percent of world GDP and the overall picture looks like this by 2020 Blue indicates a labor surplus red indicates a labor shortfall and gray are those countries which are borderline So by 2020 we still see a labor surplus in some countries like Italy France the U。S。 but this picture will change dramatically by 2030 By 2030 we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies including three out of the four BRIC countries China with its former one-child policy will be hit as well as Brazil and Russia Now to tell the truth in reality the situation will be even more challenging What you can see here are average numbers We de-averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels and what we found were even higher shortfalls for high-skilled people and a partial surplus for low-skilled workers So on top of an overall labor shortage we will face a big skill mismatch in the future and this means huge challenges in terms of education qualification upskilling for governments and companies Now the next thing we looked into was robots automation technology Will technology change this picture and boost productivity Now the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology A long answer would go like this Let's take Germany again The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity In the '90s I worked in our Boston office for almost two years and when I left an old senior partner told me literally Send me more of these Germans they work like machines That was 1998 Sixteen years later you'd probably say the opposite Send me more of these machines They work like Germans Technology will replace a lot of jobs regular jobs Not only in the production industry but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots artificial intelligence big data or automation So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs but when how fast and to what extent Or in other words will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis Yes and no This is a more sophisticated version of it depends Let's take the automotive industry as an example because there more than 40 percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place In 1980 less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts Today this number is more than 30 percent and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030 And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system In 1980 no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist As a matter of fact the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only changed slightly in the last decades in spite of robots and automation So what does this mean Yes technology will replace a lot of jobs but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch And this kind of de-averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses So people high-skilled people talents will be the big thing in the next decade If they are the scarce resource we have to understand them much better Are they actually willing to work abroad What are their job preferences To find out this year we conducted a global survey among more than 200，000 job seekers from 189 countries Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap at least in the short term so we asked about mobility More than 60 percent of these 200，000 job seekers are willing to work abroad For me a surprisingly high number If you look at the employees aged 21 to 30 this number is even higher If you split this number up by country yes the world is mobile but only partly The least mobile countries are Russia Germany and the U。S Now where would these people like to move Number seven is Australia where 28 percent could imagine moving Then France Switzerland Germany Canada U。K。 and the top choice worldwide is the U。S Now what are the job preferences of these 200，000 people So what are they looking for Out of a list of 26 topics salary is only number eight The top four topics are all around culture Number four having a great relationship with the boss; three enjoying a great work-life balance; two having a great relationship with colleagues; and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work So do I get a thank you Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment but every day And now our global workforce crisis becomes very personal People are looking for recognition Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs Now let me connect the dots We will face a global workforce crisis which consists of an overall labor shortage plus a huge skill mismatch plus a big cultural challenge And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast Right now we are just at the turning point So what can we what can governments what can companies do Every company but also every country needs a people strategy and to act on it immediately and such a people strategy consists of four parts Number one a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills Workforce planning will become more important than financial planning Two a plan for how to attract great people: generation Y women but also retirees Three a plan for how to educate and upskill them There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us And four for how to retain the best people or in other words how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture However one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes Employees are resources are assets not costs not head counts not machines not even the Germans Thank you I would like to start with the story of Mary a woman from an African village Her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by the ruling political party Her brother was murdered by the state-sponsored militia and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party One morning a month before the election Mary's village was called to another intimidation meeting In this meeting there is a man standing in front of them telling them We know who you are we know who you will vote for we're going to take revenge But for Mary this meeting is different She feels different This time she's waiting for this meeting because this time she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress a camera that nobody else can see Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings You risk your life if you do Mary knows that but she also knows that the only way to stop them and to protect herself and her community is to expose their intimidation to make sure they understand somebody is following them to break the impunity they feel Mary and her friends were filming for months undercover the intimidation of the ruling political party Filmed with hidden cameras We are now going to speak about the upcoming elections Nothing can stop us from doing what we want If we hear you are with The Opposition we will not forgive you Militia intimidation rally The Party can torture you at any time The youth can beat you Disruption of political meeting For those who lie saying they are back with The Party your time is running out Party youth militia Some have died because they rebelled Some have lost their homes If you don't work together with The Party you will lead a very bad life Oren Yakobovich: These images were broadcast all over the world but more importantly they have been broadcast back to the community The perpetrators saw them too They understood somebody is following them They got scared Impunity was broken Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election and saved hundreds of lives Mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras My background should have led me to a different direction I was born in Israel to a right-wing family and as long as I remember myself I wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country and prove what I believed was our right for the whole land I joined the Israeli army just after the first intifada the first Palestinian uprising and I served in one of the hard-minded toughest aggressive infantry units and I got the biggest gun in my platoon Quite fast I became an officer and got soldiers under my command and as time passed I started serving in the West Bank and I saw these images I didn't like what I saw It took me a while but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank and had to spend time in jail It was a bit It was not that bad I have to say It was a bit like being in a hotel but with very shitty food In jail I kept thinking that I need people to know I need people to understand what the reality in the West Bank looks like I need them to hear what I heard I need them to see what I saw but I also understood we need the Palestinians themselves the people that are suffering to be able to tell their own stories not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation I joined a human rights organization an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem Together we analyzed the West Bank and picked 100 families that are living in the most risky places: close to checkpoints near army bases side by side with settlers We gave them cameras and training Quite fast we started getting very disturbing images about how the settlers and the soldiers are abusing them I would like to share with you two clips from this project Both of them were broadcast in Israel and it created a massive debate And I have to warn you some of you might find them quite explicit The masked men you will see in the first clips are Jewish settlers Minutes before the camera was turned on they approached a Palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land because this land belongs to the Jewish settlers The Palestinians refused Let's see what happened The masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers They are approaching the Palestinian family This is a demonstration in the West Bank The guy in green is Palestinian He will be arrested in a second Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed In a few seconds he regrets he came to this demonstration He's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet He is okay Not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way We're talking about a tiny minority but they have to be brought to justice These clips and others like them forced the army and the police to start investigations They've been shown in Israel of course and the Israeli public was exposed to them also This project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories and we managed to reduce the number of violent attacks in the West Bank The success of this project got me thinking how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world Now we tend to believe that today with all of the technology the smartphones and the Internet we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world and people are able to tell their story but it's only partly true Still today with all the technology we have less than half of the world's population has access to the Internet and more than three billion people I'm repeating the number three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power More or less around the same time I'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann He's a filmmaker and an activist We understood we were thinking along the same lines and we decided to establish Videre our organization together While building the organization in London we've been traveling undercover to places where a community was suffering from abuses where mass atrocities were happening and there was a lack of reporting We tried to understand how we can help There were four things that I learned The first thing is that we have to engage with communities that are living in rural areas where violations are happening far from the public eye We need to partner with them and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them The second thing I learned is that we have to enable them to film in a safe way Security has to be the priority Where I used to work before in the West Bank one can take a camera out most likely not going to get shot but in places we wanted to work just try to pull a phone out and you're dead literally dead This is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary and use mostly hidden cameras Unfortunately I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today for obvious reasons but these are cameras we used before You can buy them off the shelf Today we're building a custom-made hidden camera like the one that Mary was wearing of the ruling political party It's a camera that nobody can see that blends into the environment into the surroundings Now filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on To keep our partners safe we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it's happened building a backup plan if something goes wrong and making sure we have everything in place before our operations start The third thing I learned is the importance of verification You can have an amazing shot of atrocity but if you can't verify it it's worth nothing Recently like in the ongoing war in Syria or the war in Gaza we've seen images that are staged or brought from a different conflict This misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source and it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources We use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information and we can trust the material It starts with vetting the partners understanding who they are and working with them very intensively How do you film a location You film road signs you film watches you film newspapers We are checking maps looking at maps double-checking the information and looking also at the metadata of the material Now the fourth and the most important thing I learned is how you use images to create a positive change To have an effect the key thing is how you use the material Today we're working with hundreds of activists filming undercover We work with them both to understand the situation on the ground and which images are missing to describe it who are the ones that are influencing the situation and when to release the material to advance the struggle Sometimes it's about putting it in the media mostly local ones to create awareness Sometimes it's working with decision makers to change laws Sometimes it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court But more than often the most effective way to create a social change is to work within the community I want to give you one example Fatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya Women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work They are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside In the next clip Fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work Her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras Fatuma Chiusiku: My name is Fatuma Chiusiku I'm 32 years old a mother And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home Each morning I ride the mini-bus each day begins with fear Come with me now and use my eyes to feel what I feel As I walk I think to myself: Will I be touched Grabbed Violated by this conductor again Even the men inside the way they look at me touch my body rub against me grab me and now as I sit in my seat I only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day my dreams my children at school but instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive and I will be violated again OY: Today there is a new front in the fight for human rights I used to carry a big gun Now I am carrying this This is a much more powerful and much much more effective weapon But we have to use its power wisely By putting the right images in the right hands at the right time we can truly create an impact Thank you Thank you I'm a lifelong traveler Even as a little kid I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California So from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole just to go to school And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly so the very week after I graduated from high school I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my 18th year on a different continent And then almost inevitably I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life Except as you all know one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it You take an angry man to the Himalayas he just starts complaining about the food And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was oddly by going nowhere just by sitting still And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives a break But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past And so to my great surprise I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba And by going nowhere I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season or even as some people do a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions And of course this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us It's an old idea More than 2，000 years ago the Stoics were reminding us it's not our experience that makes our lives it's what we do with it Imagine a hurricane suddenly sweeps through your town and reduces every last thing to rubble One man is traumatized for life But another maybe even his brother almost feels liberated and decides this is a great chance to start his life anew It's exactly the same event but radically different responses There is nothing either good or bad as Shakespeare told us in Hamlet but thinking makes it so And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler Twenty-four years ago I took the most mind-bending trip across North Korea But the trip lasted a few days What I've done with it sitting still going back to it in my head trying to understand it finding a place for it in my thinking that's lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime The trip in other words gave me some amazing sights but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights And I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation that if I really want to change my life I might best begin by changing my mind Again none of this is new; that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago but Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day The Stoics as far as I know were not on Facebook We all know that in our on-demand lives one of the things that's most on demand is ourselves Wherever we are any time of night or day our bosses junk-mailers our parents can get to us Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago but we feel as if we're working more We have more and more time-saving devices but sometimes it seems less and less time We can more and more easily make contact with people on the furthest corners of the planet but sometimes in that process we lose contact with ourselves And one of my biggest surprises as a traveler has been to find that often it's exactly the people who have most enabled us to get anywhere who are intent on going nowhere In other words precisely those beings who have created the technologies that override so many of the limits of old are the ones wisest about the need for limits even when it comes to technology I once went to the Google headquarters and I saw all the things many of you have heard about; the indoor tree houses the trampolines workers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free so that they could just let their imaginations go wandering But what impressed me even more was that as I was waiting for my digital I。D。 one Googler was telling me about the program that he was about to start to teach the many many Googlers who practice yoga to become trainers in it and the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write on the inner search engine and the ways in which science has empirically shown that sitting still or meditation can lead not just to better health or to clearer thinking but even to emotional intelligence I have another friend in Silicon Valley who is really one of the most eloquent spokesmen for the latest technologies and in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine Kevin Kelly And Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home And like many in Silicon Valley he tries really hard to observe what they call an Internet sabbath whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week they go completely offline in order to gather the sense of direction and proportion they'll need when they go online again The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology And when you speak of the sabbath look at the Ten Commandments -- there's only one word there for which the adjective holy is used and that's the Sabbath I pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah -- its longest chapter it's on the Sabbath And we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries the empty space In many a piece of music it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape And I know I as a writer will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe Now in the physical domain of course many people if they have the resources will try to get a place in the country a second home I've never begun to have those resources but I sometimes remember that any time I want I can get a second home in time if not in space just by taking a day off And it's never easy because of course whenever I do I spend much of it worried about all the extra stuff that's going to crash down on me the following day than the chance to check on my emails And every season I do try to take three days off on retreat but a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind and to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails from my bosses and maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party But as soon as I get to a place of real quiet I realize that it's only by going there that I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share with my wife or bosses or friends Otherwise really I'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness which is no blessing at all And so when I was 29 I decided to remake my entire life in the light of going nowhere One evening I was coming back from the office it was after midnight I was in a taxi driving through Times Square and I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much I could never catch up with my life And my life then as it happened was pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy I had really interesting friends and colleagues I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street I had to me a fascinating job writing about world affairs but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think -- or really to understand if I was truly happy And so I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto Japan which was the place that had long exerted a strong really mysterious gravitational pull on me Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it But it's also as you all know a beautiful city encircled by hills filled with more than 2，000 temples and shrines where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more And quite soon after I moved there I ended up where I still am with my wife formerly our kids in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle no car no TV I can understand and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion But I realized that it gives me what I prize most which is days and hours I have never once had to use a cell phone there I almost never have to look at the time and every morning when I wake up really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises as it will more than once when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway I know in my bones that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island I'll always be a traveler -- my livelihood depends on it -- but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world I once got on a plane in Frankfurt Germany and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours She didn't once turn on her video monitor she never pulled out a book she didn't even go to sleep she just sat still and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives Some people go to black-hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival Some people I know just before they go to sleep instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube just turn out the lights and listen to some music and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high dark mountains behind Los Angeles where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of Old Ideas went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world hit the top five in nine others Something in us I think is crying out who take the time and trouble to sit still And I think many of us have the sensation I certainly do that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second and that screen is our lives And it's only by stepping back and then further back and holding still that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture And a few people do that for us by going nowhere So in an age of acceleration nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow And in an age of distraction nothing is so luxurious as paying attention And in an age of constant movement nothing is so urgent as sitting still So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii or New Orleans; I bet you'll have a wonderful time But if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope in love with the world I think you might want to try considering going nowhere Thank you Vision is the most important and prioritized sense that we have We are constantly looking at the world around us and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see Let's just start with an example of that very fact I'm going to show you a photograph of a person just for a second or two and I'd like for you to identify what emotion is on his face Ready Here you go Go with your gut reaction Okay What did you see Well we actually surveyed over 120 individuals and the results were mixed People did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face Maybe you saw discomfort That was the most frequent response that we received But if you asked the person on your left they might have said regret or skepticism and if you asked somebody on your right they might have said something entirely different like hope or empathy So we are all looking at the very same face again We might see something entirely different because perception is subjective What we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind's eye Of course there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind's eye I'm going to give you just a few So dieters for instance see apples as larger than people who are not counting calories Softball players see the ball as smaller if they've just come out of a slump compared to people who had a hot night at the plate And actually our political beliefs also can affect the way we see other people including politicians So my research team and I decided to test this question In 2008 Barack Obama was running for president for the very first time and we surveyed hundreds of Americans one month before the election What we found in this survey was that some people some Americans think photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks Of these people 75 percent voted for Obama in the actual election Other people though thought photographs like these best reflect how Obama really looks 89 percent of these people voted for McCain We presented many photographs of Obama one at a time so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next was whether we had artificially lightened or darkened his skin tone So how is that possible How could it be that when I look at a person an object or an event I see something very different than somebody else does Well the reasons are many but one reason requires that we understand a little bit more about how our eyes work So vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time what we can focus on is actually relatively small What we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy is the equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm Everything else around that is blurry rendering much of what is presented to our eyes as ambiguous But we have to clarify and make sense of what it is that we see and it's our mind that helps us fill in that gap As a result perception is a subjective experience and that's how we end up seeing through our own mind's eye So I'm a social psychologist and it's questions like these that really intrigue me I am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye Why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full and somebody literally sees it as half empty What is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely different way And does that even matter So to begin to tackle these questions my research team and I decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention: our health and fitness Across the world people are struggling to manage their weight and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off For instance we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays but actually the majority of Americans find that their New Year's resolutions are broken by Valentine's Day We talk to ourselves in very encouraging ways telling ourselves this is our year to get back into shape but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight So why Of course there is no simple answer but one reason I argue is that our mind's eye might work against us Some people may literally see exercise as more difficult and some people might literally see exercise as easier So as a first step to testing these questions we gathered objective measurements of individuals' physical fitness We measured the circumference of their waist compared to the circumference of their hips A higher waist-to-hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist-to-hip ratio After gathering these measurements we told our participants that they would walk to a finish line while carrying extra weight in a sort of race But before they did that we asked them to estimate the distance to the finish line We thought that the physical states of their body might change how they perceived the distance So what did we find Well waist-to-hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance People who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape People's states of their own body changed how they perceived the environment But so too can our mind In fact our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us That led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise might actually see the finish line as closer than people who have weaker motivations So to test whether motivations affect our perceptual experiences in this way we conducted a second study Again we gathered objective measurements of people's physical fitness measuring the circumference of their waist and the circumference of their hips and we had them do a few other tests of fitness Based on feedback that we gave them some of our participants told us they're not motivated to exercise any more They felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren't going to do anything else These people were not motivated Other people though based on our feedback told us they were highly motivated to exercise They had a strong goal to make it to the finish line But again before we had them walk to the finish line we had them estimate the distance How far away was the finish line And again like the previous study we found that waist-to-hip ratio predicted perceptions of distance Unfit individuals saw the distance as farther saw the finish line as farther away than people who were in better shape Importantly though this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise On the other hand people who were highly motivated to exercise saw the distance as short Even the most out of shape individuals saw the finish line as just as close if not slightly closer than people who were in better shape So our bodies can change how far away that finish line looks but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier That led us to wonder is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help change their perceptions of the distance help them make exercise look easier So we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do and based on what we read we came up with a strategy that we called Keep your eyes on the prize So this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster It's an actual directive for how to look around your environment People that we trained in this strategy we told them to focus their attention on the finish line to avoid looking around to imagine a spotlight was shining on that goal and that everything around it was blurry and perhaps difficult to see We thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier We compared this group to a baseline group To this group we said just look around the environment as you naturally would You will notice the finish line but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right or the people and the lamp post off to the left We thought that people who used this strategy would see the distance as farther So what did we find When we had them estimate the distance was this strategy successful for changing their perceptual experience Yes People who kept their eyes on the prize saw the finish line as 30 percent closer than people who looked around as they naturally would We thought this was great We were really excited because it meant that this strategy helped make the exercise look easier but the big question was could this help make exercise actually better Could it improve the quality of exercise as well So next we told our participants you are going to walk to the finish line while wearing extra weight We added weights to their ankles that amounted to 15 percent of their body weight We told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly We designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible like most exercises that actually improve our fitness So the big question then: Did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line change their experience of the exercise It did People who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required 17 percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally It changed their subjective experience of the exercise It also changed the objective nature of their exercise People who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved 23 percent faster than people who looked around naturally To put that in perspective a 23 percent increase is like trading in your 1980 Chevy Citation for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing that is easy for people to use regardless of whether they're in shape or struggling to get there had a big effect Keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster Now I know there's more to good health than walking a little bit faster but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle If you're not convinced yet that we all see the world through our own mind's eye let me leave you with one final example Here's a photograph of a beautiful street in Stockholm with two cars The car in the back looks much larger than the car in the front However in reality these cars are the same size but that's not how we see it So does this mean that our eyes have gone haywire and that our brains are a mess No it doesn't mean that at all It's just how our eyes work We might see the world in a different way and sometimes that might not line up with reality but it doesn't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong We all see the world through our mind's eye but we can teach ourselves to see it differently So I can think of days that have gone horribly wrong for me I'm fed up I'm grumpy I'm tired and I'm so behind and there's a big black cloud hanging over my head and on days like these it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too My colleague at work looks annoyed when I ask for an extension on a deadline and my friend looks frustrated when I show up late for lunch because a meeting ran long and at the end of the day my husband looks disappointed because I'd rather go to bed than go to the movies And on days like these when everybody looks upset and angry to me I try to remind myself that there are other ways of seeing them Perhaps my colleague was confused perhaps my friend was concerned and perhaps my husband was feeling empathy instead So we all see the world through our own mind's eye and on some days it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place but it doesn't have to look that way all the time We can teach ourselves to see it differently and when we find a way to make the world look nicer and easier it might actually become so Thank you I haven't told many people this but in my head I've got thousands of secret worlds all going on all at the same time I am also autistic People tend to diagnose autism with really specific check-box descriptions but in reality it's a whole variation as to what we're like For instance my little brother he's very severely autistic He's nonverbal He can't talk at all But I love to talk People often associate autism with liking maths and science and nothing else but I know so many autistic people who love being creative But that is a stereotype and the stereotypes of things are often if not always wrong For instance a lot of people think autism and think Rain Man immediately That's the common belief that every single autistic person is Dustin Hoffman and that's not true But that's not just with autistic people either I've seen it with LGBTQ people with women with POC people People are so afraid of variety that they try to fit everything into a tiny little box with really specific labels This is something that actually happened to me in real life: I googled autistic people are 。。 and it comes up with suggestions as to what you're going to type I googled autistic people are 。。 and the top result was demons That is the first thing that people think when they think autism They know One of the things I can do because I'm autistic it's an ability rather than a disability is I've got a very very vivid imagination Let me explain it to you a bit It's like I'm walking in two worlds most of the time There's the real world the world that we all share and there's the world in my mind and the world in my mind is often so much more real than the real world Like it's very easy for me to let my mind loose because I don't try and fit myself into a tiny little box That's one of the best things about being autistic You don't have the urge to do that You find what you want to do you find a way to do it and you get on with it If I was trying to fit myself into a box I wouldn't be here I wouldn't have achieved half the things that I have now There are problems though There are problems with being autistic and there are problems with having too much imagination School can be a problem in general but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson that adds to your list of problems Also when my imagination takes hold my body takes on a life of its own When something very exciting happens in my inner world I've just got to run I've got to rock backwards and forwards or sometimes scream This gives me so much energy and I've got to have an outlet for all that energy But I've done that ever since I was a child ever since I was a tiny little girl And my parents thought it was cute so they didn't bring it up but when I got into school they didn't really agree that it was cute It can be that people don't want to be friends with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson And this doesn't normally happen in this day and age but it can be that people don't want to be friends with the autistic girl It can be that people don't want to associate with anyone who won't or can't fit themselves into a box that's labeled normal But that's fine with me because it sorts the wheat from the chaff and I can find which people are genuine and true and I can pick these people as my friends But if you think about it what is normal What does it mean Imagine if that was the best compliment you ever received Wow you are really normal But compliments are you are extraordinary or you step outside the box It's you're amazing So if people want to be these things why are so many people striving to be normal Why are people pouring their brilliant individual light into a mold People are so afraid of variety that they try and force everyone even people who don't want to or can't to become normal There are camps for LGBTQ people or autistic people to try and make them this normal and that's terrifying that people would do that in this day and age All in all I wouldn't trade my autism and my imagination for the world Because I am autistic I've presented documentaries to the BBC I'm in the midst of writing a book I'm doing this this is fantastic and one of the best things that I've achieved that I consider to have achieved is I've found ways of communicating with my little brother and sister who as I've said are nonverbal They can't speak And people would often write off someone who's nonverbal but that's silly because my little brother and sister are the best siblings that you could ever hope for They're just the best and I love them so much and I care about them more than anything else I'm going to leave you with one question: If we can't get inside the person's minds no matter if they're autistic or not instead of punishing anything that strays from normal why not celebrate uniqueness and cheer every time someone unleashes their imagination Thank you I want you guys to imagine that you're a soldier running through the battlefield Now you're shot in the leg with a bullet which severs your femoral artery Now this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes Unfortunately by the time that a medic actually gets to you what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more with the application of pressure to stop that type of bleed Now this problem is not only a huge problem for the military but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body So now what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials which are actually materials that will work with the body helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally So now before we do this we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work So now everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells So the cell is the most basic unit of life But not many people know what else But it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix So now the ECM is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place provides structure for your tissues but it also gives the cells a home It allows them to feel what they're doing where they are and tells them how to act and how to behave And it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every single part of the body So the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver and the ECM in different parts of the same organ actually vary so it's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the local extracellular matrix which is exactly what we're trying to do So now for example think of the rainforest You have the canopy you have the understory and you have the forest floor Now all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants and different animals call them home So just like that the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions On top of that the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing so if you imagine cutting the body you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in order to get it to form again and a scar in fact is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix So now behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix So as you see your cells sit in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue the extracellular matrix changes So now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two- dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself So when I was a freshman at NYU what I discovered was you could actually take small pieces of plant-derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me you can actually put our material onto this and just like Lego blocks it'll reassemble into the local tissue So that means if you put it onto liver it turns into something that looks like liver and if you put it onto skin it turns into something that looks just like skin So when you put the gel on it actually reassembles into this local tissue So now this has a whole bunch of applications but basically the idea is wherever you put this product you're able to reassemble into it immediately Now this is a simulated arterial bleed blood warning at twice human artery pressure So now this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic and like I said before would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop Now in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself our material is able to stop that bleed and it's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal so it reassembles into this piece of meat and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening and produces fibrin producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds So now this technology Thank you So now this technology by January will be in the hands of veterinarians and we're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of doctors hopefully within the next year But really once again I want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running through a battlefield Now you get hit in the leg with a bullet and instead of bleeding out in three minutes you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt and with the press of a button you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to recovery Thank you very much Well good afternoon How many of you took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Woo hoo Well I have to tell you from the bottom of our hearts thank you so very very much has raised 125 million dollars Woo hoo It takes me back to the summer of 2011 My family my kids had all grown up We were officially empty nesters and we decided let's go on a family vacation Jenn my daughter and my son-in-law came down from New York My youngest Andrew he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston and my son Pete who had played at Boston College baseball had played baseball professionally in Europe and had now come home and was selling group insurance he also joined us And one night I found myself having a beer with Pete and Pete was looking at me and he just said You know Mom I don't know selling group insurance is just not my passion He said I just don't feel I'm living up to my potential I don't feel this is my mission in life And he said You know oh by the way Mom I have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team that I play for made the playoffs and I have to get back to Boston because I can't let my team down I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball So off Pete went and left the family vacation break a mother's heart and he went and we followed four days later to see the next playoff game We're at the playoff game Pete's at the plate and a fastball's coming in and it hits him on the wrist Oh Pete His wrist went completely limp like this So for the next six months Pete went back to his home in Southie kept working that unpassionate job and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back Six months later in March he called my husband and me and he said Oh Mom and Dad we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me I said Sure we'll come in That morning Pete John and I all got up got dressed got in our cars three separate cars because we were going to go to work We walked into the neurologist's office sat down four doctors walk in and the head neurologist sits down And he says Well Pete we've been looking at all the tests and I have to tell you it's not a sprained wrist it's not a broken wrist it's not nerve damage in the wrist it's not an infection it's not Lyme disease And there was this deliberate elimination going up and I was thinking to myself where is he going with this Then he put his hands on his knees he looked right at my 27-year-old kid and said I don't know how to tell a 27-year-old this: Pete you have ALS ALS I had had a friend whose 80-year-old father had ALS I looked at my husband he looked at me and then we looked at the doctor and we said ALS Okay what treatment Let's go What do we do Let's go And he looked at us and he said Mr and Mrs Frates I'm sorry to tell you this but there's no treatment and there's no cure We were the worst culprits We didn't even understand that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against ALS So we all went home and Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street Andrew came home from Charlestown and Pete went to B。C to pick up his then-girlfriend Julie and brought her home and six hours later after diagnosis we're sitting around having a family dinner and we're having small chat I don't even remember cooking dinner that night But then our leader Pete set the vision and talked to us just like we were his new team He said There will be no wallowing people He goes We're not looking back we're looking forward What an amazing opportunity we have to change the world I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS We're going to move the needle and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates And that was it We were given our directive So in the days and months that followed within a week we had our brothers and sisters and our family come to us that they were already creating Team Frate Train Uncle Dave he was the webmaster; Uncle Artie he was the accountant; Auntie Dana she was the graphic artist; and my youngest son Andrew quit his job left his apartment in Charlestown and says I'm going to take care of Pete and be his caregiver Then all those people classmates teammates coworkers that Pete had inspired throughout his whole life the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another and made Team Frate Train Six months after diagnosis Pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy He got up and gave a very eloquent speech and at the end of the speech there was a panel and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and I'm sitting there and I'm listening to them and most of the content went straight over my head I avoided every science class I ever could But I was watching these people and I was listening to them and they were saying I I do this I do that and there was a real unfamiliarity between them So at the end of their talk the panel they had questions and answers and boom my hand went right up and I get the microphone and I look at them and I say Thank you Thank you so much for working in ALS It means so very much to us I said But I do have to tell you that I'm watching your body language and I'm listening to what you're saying It just doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of collaboration going on here And not only that where's the flip chart with the action items and the follow-up and the accountability What are you going to do after you leave this room And then I turned around and there was about 200 pairs of eyes just staring at me And it was that point that I realized that I had talked about the elephant in the room Thus my mission had begun So over the next couple of years Pete we've had our highs and our lows Pete was put on a compassionate use drug It was hope in a bottle for the whole ALS community It was in a phase III trial Then six months later the data comes back: no efficacy We were supposed to have therapies overseas and the rug was pulled out from under us So for the next two years we just watched my son be taken away from me little by little every day Two and a half years ago Pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields Today Pete's completely paralyzed He can't hold his head up any longer He's confined to a motorized wheelchair He can no longer swallow or eat He has a feeding tube He can't speak He talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device and we're watching his lungs because his diaphragm eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not ALS robs the human of all their physical parts but the brain stays intact So July 4th 2014 75th year of Lou Gehrig's inspirational speech comes and Pete is asked by MLB。com to write an article in the Bleacher Report And it was very significant because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology Twenty days later the ice started to fall On July 27th Pete's roommate in New York City wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt signifying Pat Quinn another ALS patient known in New York and B。C shorts said I'm taking the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge picked up the ice put it over his head And I'm nominating 。。 And he sent it up to Boston And that was on July 27th Over the next couple of days our news feed was full of family and friends If you haven't gone back the nice thing about Facebook is that you have the dates you can go back You've got to see Uncle Artie's human Bloody Mary I'm telling you it's one of the best ones and that was probably in day two By about day four Uncle Dave the webmaster he isn't on Facebook and I get a text from him and it says Nancy what the hell is going on Uncle Dave gets a hit every time Pete's website is gone onto and his phone was blowing up So we all sat down and we realized money is coming in how amazing So we knew awareness would lead to funding we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days So we got together put our best 501s on Pete's website and off we went So week one Boston media Week two national media It was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying I think you people might need food in there Week three celebrities Entertainment Tonight Access Hollywood Did anyone see Lost In Translation My husband did Japanese television It was interesting And those videos the popular ones Paul Bissonnette's glacier video incredible How about the redemption nuns of Dublin Who's seen that one It's absolutely fantastic J。T。 Justin Timberlake That's when we knew that was a real A-list celebrity I go back on my texts and I can see JT JT My sister texting me Angela Merkel the chancellor of Germany Incredible And the ALS patients you know what their favorite ones are and their families' All of them Because this misunderstood and underfunded rare disease they just sat and watched people saying it over and over: ALS ALS It was unbelievable And those naysayers let's just talk a couple of stats shall we Okay so the ALS Association they think by year end it'll be 160 million dollars ALS TDI in Cambridge they raised three million dollars Well guess what They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing It was on a three-year track for funding Two months It's coming out starting in two months And YouTube has reported that over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS And Facebook 2。5 million videos and I had the awesome adventure visiting the Facebook campus last week and I said to them I know what it was like in my house I can't imagine what it was like around here All she said was Jaw-dropping And my family's favorite video Bill Gates Because the night Pete was diagnosed he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates and he did it Goal number one check Now on to the treatment and cure So okay after all of this ice we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that I'd like you to remember The first thing is every morning when you wake up you can choose to live your day in positivity Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers over my head every day No I don't think anybody would blame me but Pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals that's why they got ALS and I was like I don't think so but I had to get away from the negativity The second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental toughness to put themselves out there Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages You'll see the kids they're up there hanging it up Pete is that okay Yup And then they put it right into his stomach Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is and how he's never ever going to give up And the third thing I want to leave you with: If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it Thank you I know that I'm running over but I've got to leave you with this: the gifts that my son has given me I have had 29 years of having the honor of being the mother of Pete Frates Pete Frates has been inspiring and leading his whole life He's thrown out kindness and all that kindness has come back to him He walks the face of the Earth right now and knows why he's here What a gift The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life Now I know why I'm here I'm going to save my son and if it doesn't happen in time for him I'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I'm going through And the third thing and last but not least gift that my son has given me as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August 2014: That girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife and Pete and Julie have given me my granddaughter Lucy Fitzgerald Frates Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early as the exclamation point on August 31st 2014 And so And so let me leave you with Pete's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates coworkers and teammates Be passionate Be genuine Be hardworking And don't forget to be great Thank you Vincent Moon: How can we use computers cameras microphones to represent the world in an alternative way as much as possible How maybe is it possible to use the Internet to create a new form of cinema And actually why do we record Well it is with such simple questions in mind that I started to make films 10 years ago first with a friend Christophe Abric He had a website La Blogothèque dedicated to independent music We were crazy about music We wanted to represent music in a different way as much as possible far from the music industry We started to publish every week sessions on the Internet From Grizzly Bear in the shower to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower From Arcade Fire in an elevator in the Olympiades to Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn From R。E。M in a car to The National around a table at night in the south of France From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night and many many many more unknown or very famous bands We published all those films for free on the Internet and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way We wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new technologies At the time 10 years ago actually there was no such project on the Internet got quite successful reaching millions of viewers After a while I got a bit I wanted to go somewhere else I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music to explore the world going to other corners and actually it was also this idea of nomadic cinema sort of that I had in mind How could the use of new technologies and the road fit together How could I edit my films in a bus crossing the Andes So I went on five-year travels around the globe I started at the time in the digital film and music label collection Petites Planètes which was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker We're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films From the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil Gaby Amarantos to a female ensemble in Chechnya From experimental electronic music in Singapore with One Man Nation to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing on his rooftop in São Paolo From The Bambir the great rock band from Armenia to some traditional songs in a restaurant in Tbilisi Georgia From White Shoes a great retro pop band from Jakarta Indonesia to DakhaBrakha the revolutionary band from Kiev Ukraine From Tomi Lebrero to many other places and musicians around the world My desire was to make it as a trek To do all those films it would have been impossible with a big company behind me with a structure or anything I was traveling alone with a backpack computer camera microphones in it Alone actually but just with local people meeting my team which was absolutely not professional people on the spot there going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek I really believed that cinema could be this very simple thing: I want to make a film and you're going to give me a place to stay for the night I give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha Well or other drinks depending on where you are In Peru they drink pisco sour Well when I arrived in Peru actually I had no idea about what I would do there And I just had one phone number actually of one person Three months later after traveling all around the country I had recorded 33 films only with the help of local people only with the help of people that I was asking all the time the same question: What is important to record here today By living in such a way by working without any structure I was able to react to the moment This is important to record that whole person This is important to create this exchange When I went to Chechnya the first person I met looked at me and was like What are you doing here Are you a journalist NGO Politics What kind of problems are you going to study Well I was there to research on Sufi rituals in Chechnya actually incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya which is absolutely unknown outside of the region As soon as people understood that I would give them those films I would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license but I would also really give them to the people and I would let them do what they want with it I just want to represent them in a beautiful light I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather and they're going to be like Whoa my grandfather is as cool as Beyoncé It's a really important thing It's really important because that's the way people are going to look differently at their own culture at their own land They're going to think about it differently It may be a way to maintain a certain diversity Why you will record Hmm There's a really good quote by American thinker Hakim Bey which says Every recording is a tombstone of a live performance It's a really good sentence to keep in mind nowadays in an era saturated by images What's the point of that Where do we go with it I was researching I was still keeping this idea in mind: What's the point I was researching on music trying to pull trying to get closer to a certain origin of it Where is this all coming from I am French I had no idea about what I would discover which is a very simple thing: Everything was sacred at first and music was spiritual healing How could I use my camera my little tool to get closer and maybe not only capture the trance but find an equivalent a cine-trance maybe something in complete harmony with the people on spirituality on new spirits around the world Maybe a few more extracts now From the Tana Toraja funeral ritual in Indonesia to an Easter ceremony in the north of Ethiopia From jathilan a popular trance ritual on the island of Java to Umbanda in the north of Brazil The Sufi rituals of Chechnya to a mass in the holiest church of Armenia Some Sufi songs in Harar the holy city of Ethiopia to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the Amazon of Peru with the Shipibo Then to my new project the one I'm doing now here in Brazil named Híbridos I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon It's research on the new spiritualities all around the country This is my quest my own little quest of what I call experimental ethnography trying to hybrid all those different genres trying to regain a certain complexity Why do we record I was still there I really believe cinema teaches us to see The way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible terrible job at representing the world: violence extremists only spectacular events only simplifications of everyday life I think we are recording to regain a certain complexity To reinvent life today And it's very simple Muito obrigado Vincent Vincent Vincent Merci We have to prepare for the following performance and I have a question for you and the question is this: You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome You walk into sacred rituals private moments in a village a town a group of people How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens VM: I think you break it with your body more than with your knowledge That's what it taught me to travel to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain The respect is stepping forward not stepping backward and I really think that by engaging your body in the moment in the ceremony in the places people welcome you and understand your energy You told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot You don't do much editing I mean you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length etc Otherwise you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning and so is that the case It's correct VM: My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut in a way as long as we let the viewer watch more and more viewers are going to feel closer are going to get closer to the moment to that moment and to that place I really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer to not cut all the time from one place to another to just let the time go Tell me in a few words about your new project Híbridos here in Brazil Just before coming to TEDGlobal you have actually been traveling around the country for that Tell us a couple of things VM: Híbridos is I really believe Brazil far from the cliches is the greatest religious country in the world the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities And it's a big project I'm doing over this year which is researching in very different regions of Brazil in very different forms of cults and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays The man who is going to appear onstage momentarily and Vincent's going to introduce him is one of the subjects of one of his past videos When did you do a video with him VM: I guess four years ago four years in my first travel So it was one of your first ones in Brazil VM: It was amongst the first ones in Brazil yeah I shot the film in Recife in the place where he is from So let's introduce him Who are we waiting for VM: I'll just make it very short It's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest Brazilian musicians of all time Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos Naná Vasconcelos Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle They told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession that I should be fired have my medical license taken away that I should go back to my own country My email got hacked In a discussion forum for other doctors someone took credit for Twitter-bombing my account Now I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing but then came the response: Too bad it wasn't a real bomb I never thought that I would do something that would provoke this level of anger among other doctors Becoming a doctor was my dream I grew up in China and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week I had this one doctor Dr Sam who always took care of me She was about the same age as my mother She had this wild curly hair and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses She was one of those doctors who if you fell and you broke your arm she would ask you why you weren't laughing See you'd groan but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her Well we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like right Well I wanted to be just like Dr Sam When I was eight my parents and I moved to the U。S。 and ours became the typical immigrant narrative My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream Well eventually I learned enough English and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service But then one day everything changed My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well she had a cough that wouldn't go away she was short of breath and tired Well I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything For her to tell me that something was the matter I knew something had to be really wrong And it was: We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer cancer that by then had spread to her lungs her bones and her brain My mother was brave though and she had hope She went through surgery and radiation and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it but she found something else too On several websites he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her She called me in a panic and I didn't know what to believe Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her but maybe it wasn't It made her scared and it made her doubt When it comes to medicine having that trust is a must and when that trust is gone then all that's left is fear There's another side to this fear As a medical student I was taking care of this 19-year-old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit run over by an SUV He had seven broken ribs shattered hip bones and he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain Now imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle 2，000 miles away to find their son in a coma I mean you'd want to find out what's going on with him right They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan which I thought was a reasonable request and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared The head doctor though said no He gave all kinds of reasons Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions He even said What if they see mistakes and sue us What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear and what I learned was that to become a doctor we have to put on our white coats put up a wall and hide behind it There's a hidden epidemic in medicine Of course patients are scared when they come to the doctor Imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache you go to the hospital you're lying in this strange place you're on this hospital gurney you're wearing this flimsy gown strangers are coming to poke and prod at you You don't know what's going to happen You don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago But it's not just patients who are scared; doctors are scared too We're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about And so what do we do We put on our white coats and we hide behind them Of course the more we hide the more people want to know what it is that we're hiding The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care We don't just have a fear of sickness we have a sickness of fear Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do Can we overcome the sickness of fear Let me ask you differently: If hiding isn't the answer what if we did the opposite What if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients Last fall I conducted a research study to find out what it is that people want to know about their healthcare I didn't just want to study patients in a hospital but everyday people So my two medical students Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns literally took their research to the streets They went to banks coffee shops senior centers Chinese restaurants and train stations What did they find Well when we asked people What do you want to know about your healthcare people responded with what they want to know about their doctors because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors When we asked What do you want to know about your doctors people gave three different answers Some want to know that their doctor is competent and certified to practice medicine Some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science not on who pays them Surprisingly to us many people want to know something else about their doctors Jonathan a 28-year-old law student says he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients and specializes in LGBT health Serena a 32-year-old accountant says that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights Frank a 59-year-old hardware store owner doesn't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first but who is comfortable with alternative treatments One after another our respondents told us that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets they want to first understand their doctor's values Just because doctors have to see every patient doesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice As a result of this I formed a campaign Who's My Doctor that calls for total transparency in medicine Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in but also our conflicts of interest We go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations and we talk about how we're paid Incentives matter If you go to your doctor because of back pain you might want to know he's getting paid 5，000 dollars to perform spine surgery versus 25 dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist or if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends Then we go one step further We add our values when it comes to women's health LGBT health alternative medicine preventive health and end-of-life decisions We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you so you have a right to know who we are We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear I thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't but I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue Within one week of starting Who's My Doctor Medscape's public forum and several online doctors' communities had thousands of posts about this topic Here are a few From a gastroenterologist in Portland: I devoted 12 years of my life to being a slave I have loans and mortgages I depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients Well times may be hard for everyone but try telling your patient making 35，000 dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte: I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from My patients don't disclose their incomes to me But your patients' sources of income don't affect your health From a psychiatrist in New York City: Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs what model of car we drive and what toilet paper we use Well how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle won't affect your patients' health but your views on a woman's right to choose and preventive medicine and end-of-life decisions just might And my favorite from a Kansas City cardiologist: More government-mandated stuff Dr Wen needs to move back to her own country Well two pieces of good news First of all this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory and second of all I'm American and I'm already here Within a month my employers were getting calls asking for me to be fired I received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me My friends and family urged me to quit this campaign After the bomb threat I was done But then I heard from patients Over social media a TweetChat which I'd learned what that was by then generated 4。3 million impressions and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue They wrote with things like If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of they shouldn't be doing it Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions Lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests Why shouldn't doctors And finally many people wrote and said Let us patients decide what's important when we're choosing a doctor In our initial trial over 300 doctors have taken the total transparency pledge What a crazy new idea right But actually this is not that new of a concept at all Remember Dr Sam my doctor in China with the goofy jokes and the wild hair Well she was my doctor but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street I went to the same school as her daughter My parents and I trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for and she had no need to hide from us Just one generation ago this was the norm in the U。S as well You knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys that he quit smoking a few years ago that he says he's a regular churchgoer but you see him twice a year: once at Easter and once when his mother-in-law comes to town You knew what he was about and he had no need to hide from you But the sickness of fear has taken over and patients suffer the consequences I know this firsthand My mother fought her cancer for eight years She was a planner and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die Not only did she sign advance directives she wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough how it was time for her to go One day when I was a resident physician I got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit By the time I got there she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine But this is not what she wants I said and we have documents The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye pointed at my then 16-year-old sister and said Do you remember when you were that age How would you have liked to grow up without your mother Her oncologist was there too and said This is your mother Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her I knew my mother so well I understood what her directives meant so well but I was a physician That was the single hardest decision I ever made to let her die in peace and I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day We can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need We can get there because we've been there before and we know that transparency gets us to that trust Research has shown us that openness also helps doctors that having open medical records being willing to talk about medical errors will increase patient trust improve health outcomes and reduce malpractice That openness that trust is only going to be more important as we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease Bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy but for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices to address issues like smoking cessation blood-pressure management and diabetes control well that requires us to establish trust Here's what other transparent doctors have said Brandon Combs an internist in Denver: This has brought me closer to my patients The type of relationship I've developed that's why I entered medicine Aaron Stupple an internist in Denver: I tell my patients that I am totally open with them I don't hide anything from them This is me Now tell me about you We're in this together May Nguyen a family physician in Houston: My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing They ask me how I could be so brave I said I'm not being brave it's my job I leave you today with a final thought Being totally transparent is scary You feel naked exposed and vulnerable but that vulnerability that humility it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine When doctors are willing to step off our pedestals take off our white coats and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about that's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear That's when we establish trust That's when we change the paradigm of medicine from one of secrecy and hiding to one that is fully open and engaged for our patients Thank you What has the War on Drugs done to the world Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico Central America so many other parts of the planet the global black market estimated at 300 billion dollars a year police and military drawn into an unwinnable war that violates basic rights and ordinary citizens just hope they don't get caught in the crossfire and meanwhile more people using more drugs than ever and Al Capone times 50 Which is why it's particularly galling to me behind this global drug war Ask why so many countries criminalize drugs they'd never heard of why the U。N drug treaties emphasize criminalization over health even why most of the money worldwide for dealing with drug abuse goes not to helping agencies but those that punish Why did we do this Some people especially in Latin America think it's not really about drugs It's just a subterfuge for advancing the realpolitik interests of the U。S But by and large that's not it We don't want gangsters and guerrillas funded with illegal drug money terrorizing and taking over other nations No the fact is America really is crazy when it comes to drugs I mean don't forget we're the ones who thought that we could prohibit alcohol So think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis But here's the good news Now it's the Russians leading the Drug War and not us Most politicians in my country want to roll back the Drug War now put fewer people behind bars not more and I'm proud to say as an American that we now lead the world in reforming marijuana policies It's now legal for medical purposes in almost half our 50 states millions of people can purchase their marijuana their medicine in government- licensed dispensaries and over half my fellow citizens now say it's time to legally regulate and tax marijuana more or less like alcohol That's what Colorado and Washington are doing and Uruguay and others are sure to follow So that's what I do: work to end the Drug War I think it all started growing up in a fairly religious moral family eldest son of a rabbi going off to university where I smoked some marijuana and I liked it And I liked drinking too but it was obvious that alcohol was really the more dangerous of the two but my friends and I could get busted for smoking a joint Now that hypocrisy kept bugging me I talked my way into the State Department I got a security clearance I interviewed hundreds of DEA and other law enforcement agents all around Europe and the Americas and I'd ask them What do you think the answer is Well in Latin America they'd say to me You can't really cut off the supply The answer lies back in the U。S。 in cutting off the demand So then I go back home and I talk to people involved in anti-drug efforts there and they'd say You know Ethan you can't really cut off the demand The answer lies over there You've got to cut off the supply Then I'd go and talk to the guys in customs trying to stop drugs at the borders and they'd say You're not going to stop it here The answer lies over there in cutting off supply and demand And it hit me: Everybody involved in this thought the answer lay in that area about which they knew the least So that's when I started reading everything I could about psychoactive drugs: the history the science the politics all of it and the more one read the more it hit you how a thoughtful enlightened intelligent approach took you over here whereas the politics and laws of my country were taking you over here And that disparity struck me as this incredible intellectual and moral puzzle There's probably never been a drug-free society Virtually every society has ingested psychoactive substances to deal with pain increase our energy socialize even commune with God Our desire to alter our consciousness may be as fundamental as our desires for food companionship and sex So our true challenge is to learn how to live with drugs so they cause the least possible harm and in some cases the greatest possible benefit I'll tell you something else I learned that the reason some drugs are legal and others not has almost nothing to do with science or health or the relative risk of drugs and almost everything to do with who uses and who is perceived to use particular drugs In the late 19th century when most of the drugs that are now illegal were legal the principal consumers of opiates in my country and others were middle-aged white women using them to alleviate aches and pains when few other analgesics were available And nobody thought about criminalizing it back then because nobody wanted to put Grandma behind bars But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese started showing up in my country working hard on the railroads and the mines and then kicking back in the evening just like they had in the old country with a few puffs on that opium pipe that's when you saw the first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves The first cocaine prohibition laws similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society And the first marijuana prohibition laws all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest And what was true in my country is true in so many others as well with both the origins of these laws and their implementation Put it this way and I exaggerate only slightly: If the principal smokers of cocaine were affluent older white men and the principal consumers of Viagra were poor young black men then smokable cocaine would be easy to get with a prescription from your doctor and selling Viagra would get you five to 10 years behind bars I used to be a professor teaching about this Now I'm an activist a human rights activist and what drives me is my shame at living in an otherwise great nation that has less than five percent of the world's population but almost 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population It's the people I meet who have lost someone they love to drug-related violence or prison or overdose or AIDS because our drug policies emphasize criminalization over health It's good people who have lost their jobs their homes their freedom even their children to the state not because they hurt anyone but solely because they chose to use one drug instead of another So is legalization the answer On that I'm torn: three days a week I think yes three days a week I think no and on Sundays I'm agnostic But since today is Tuesday let me just say that legally regulating and taxing most of the drugs that are now criminalized would radically reduce the crime violence corruption and black markets and the problems of adulterated and unregulated drugs and improve public safety and allow taxpayer resources to be developed to more useful purposes I mean look the markets in marijuana cocaine heroin and methamphetamine are global commodities markets just like the global markets in alcohol tobacco coffee sugar and so many other things Where there is a demand there will be a supply Knock out one source and another inevitably emerges People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies Now with marijuana that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol The benefits of doing so are enormous the risks minimal Will more people use marijuana Maybe but it's not going to be young people because it's not going to be legalized for them and quite frankly they already have the best access to marijuana I think it's going to be older people It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long-term marriage And that just might be a net public health benefit As for the other drugs look at Portugal where nobody goes to jail for possessing drugs and the government's made a serious commitment to treating addiction as a health issue Look at Switzerland Germany the Netherlands Denmark England where people who have been addicted to heroin for many years and repeatedly tried to quit and failed can get pharmaceutical heroin and helping services in medical clinics and the results are in: Illegal drug abuse and disease and overdoses and crime and arrests all go down health and well-being improve taxpayers benefit and many drug users even put their addictions behind them Look at New Zealand which recently enacted a law allowing certain recreational drugs to be sold legally provided their safety had been established Look here in Brazil and some other countries where a remarkable psychoactive substance ayahuasca can be legally bought and consumed provided it's done so within a religious context Look in Bolivia and Peru the source of cocaine are sold legally over the counter with no apparent harm to people's public health I mean don't forget Coca-Cola had cocaine in it until 1900 and so far as we know was no more addictive than Coca-Cola is today Conversely think about cigarettes: Nothing can both hook you and kill you like cigarettes When researchers ask heroin addicts what's the toughest drug to quit most say cigarettes Yet in my country and many others half of all the people who were ever addicted to cigarettes have quit or sent to a treatment program by a prosecutor or a judge What did it were higher taxes and time and place restrictions on sale and use and effective anti-smoking campaigns Now could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal Probably But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result So the challenges we face today are twofold The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies even as we need to get better at regulating But the second challenge is tougher because it's about us The obstacles to reform lie not just out there in the power of the prison industrial complex or other vested interests that want to keep things the way they are but within each and every one of us It's our fears and our lack of knowledge and imagination that stands in the way of real reform And ultimately I think that boils down to the kids and to every parent's desire to put our baby in a bubble and the fear that somehow drugs will pierce that bubble and put our young ones at risk In fact sometimes it seems like the entire War on Drugs gets justified as one great big child protection act which any young person can tell you it's not So here's what I say to teenagers First don't do drugs Second don't do drugs Third if you do do drugs there's some things I want you to know because my bottom line as your parent is come home safely at the end of the night and grow up and lead a healthy and good adulthood That's my drug education mantra: Safety first So this is what I've dedicated my life to to building an organization and a movement of people who believe we need to turn our backs on the failed prohibitions of the past and embrace new drug policies grounded in science compassion health and human rights where people who come from across the political spectrum and every other spectrum as well where people who love our drugs people who hate drugs and people who don't give a damn about drugs but every one of us believes that this War on Drugs has got to end Thank you Thank you Thank you Ethan congrats quite the reaction That was a powerful talk Not quite a complete standing O though and I'm guessing that some people here and maybe a few watching online maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend or whatever who got sick maybe died from some drug overdose I'm sure you've had these people approach you before What do you say to them Ethan Nadelmann: Chris the most amazing thing that's happened of late is that I've met a growing number of people who have actually lost a sibling or a child to a drug overdose and 10 years ago those people just wanted to say let's line up all the drug dealers and shoot them and that will solve it And what they've come to understand is that the Drug War did nothing to protect their kids If anything it made it more likely that those kids were put at risk And so they're now becoming part of this drug policy reform movement There's other people who have kids one's addicted to alcohol the other one's addicted to cocaine or heroin and they ask themselves the question: Why does this kid get to take one step at a time and try to get better and that one's got to deal with jail and police and criminals all the time So everybody's understanding the Drug War's not protecting anybody Certainly in the U。S。 you've got political gridlock on most issues Is there any realistic chance of anything actually shifting on this issue in the next five years EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable I'm getting all these calls from journalists now who are saying to me Ethan it seems like the only two issues advancing politically in America right now are marijuana law reform and gay marriage What are you doing right And then you're looking at bipartisanship breaking out with actually Republicans in the Congress with majority Democratic support so we've gone from being sort of the third rail the most fearful issue of American politics to becoming one of the most successful Ethan thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal EN: Chris thanks so much Thank you EN: Thank you On January 4 1934 a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress that 80 years on still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet That young man wasn't a politician he wasn't a businessman a civil rights activist or a faith leader He was that most unlikely of heroes an economist His name was Simon Kuznets and the report that he delivered was called National Income 1929-1932 Now you might think this is a rather dry and dull report And you're absolutely right It's dry as a bone But this report is the foundation of how today we judge the success of countries: what we know best as Gross Domestic Product GDP GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last 80 years And today I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries a different way to define and shape our lives for the next 80 years But first we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives Kuznets' report was delivered at a moment of crisis The U。S economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policy makers were struggling to respond Struggling because they didn't know what was going on They didn't have data and statistics So what Kuznet's report gave them was reliable data on what the U。S economy was producing updated year by year And armed with this information policy makers were eventually able to find a way out of the slump And because Kuznets' invention was found to be so useful it spread around the world And now today every country produces GDP statistics But in that first report Kuznets himself delivered a warning It's in the introductory chapter On page seven he says The welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above It's not the greatest sound bite in the world and it's dressed up in the cautious language of the economist But his message was clear: GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance It's not a measure of our well-being And it shouldn't be a guide to all decision making But we have ignored Kuznets' warning We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy Our politicians boast when GDP goes up Markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down all measured in GDP Our societies have become engines to create more GDP But we know that GDP is flawed It ignores the environment It counts bombs and prisons as progress It can't count happiness or community And it has nothing to say about fairness or justice Is it any surprise that our world marching to the drumbeat of GDP is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict We need a better way to measure our societies a measure based on the real things that matter to real people Do I have enough to eat Can I read and write Am I safe Do I have rights Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against Is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental destruction These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer There have of course been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP But I believe that we're living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution We're ready because we've seen in the financial crisis of 2008 how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray We've seen in the Arab Spring how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars but they were societies that were seething with discontentment We're ready because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets Today I'd like to introduce you to the Social Progress Index It's a measure of the well-being of society completely separate from GDP It's a whole new way of looking at the world The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society based around three dimensions The first is does everyone have the basic needs for survival: food water shelter safety Secondly does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives: education information health and sustainable environment And then third does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles Do they have rights freedom of choice freedom from discrimination and access to the the world's most advanced knowledge Together these 12 components form the Social Progress framework And for each of these 12 components we have indicators to measure how countries are performing Not indicators of effort or intention but real achievement We don't measure how much a country spends on healthcare we measure the length and quality of people's lives We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination we measure whether people experience discrimination But what you want to know is who's top don't you I knew that I knew that I knew that Okay I'm going to show you I'm going to show you on this chart So here we are what I've done here is put on the vertical axis social progress Higher is better And then just for comparison just for fun on the horizontal axis is GDP per capita Further to the right is more So the country in the world with the highest social progress the number one country on social progress is New Zealand Well done Never been; must go The country with the least social progress I'm sorry to say is Chad I've never been; maybe next year Or maybe the year after Now I know what you're thinking You're thinking Aha but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad It's a good point well made But let me show you two other countries Here's the United States considerably richer than New Zealand but with a lower level of social progress And then here's Senegal it's got a higher level of social progress than Chad but the same level of GDP So what's going on Well look Let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world the 132 we've been able to measure each one represented by a dot There we go Lots of dots Now obviously I can't do all of them so a few highlights for you: The highest ranked G7 country is Canada My country the United Kingdom is sort of middling sort of dull but who cares at least we beat the French And then looking at the emerging economies top of the BRICS pleased to say is Brazil Come on cheer Go Brazil Beating South Africa then Russia then China and then India Tucked away on the right-hand side you will see a dot of a country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount of social progress that's Kuwait Just above Brazil is a social progress superpower that's Costa Rica It's got a level of social progress the same as some Western European countries with a much lower GDP Now my slide is getting a little cluttered and I'd like to step back a bit So let me take away these countries and then pop in the regression line So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress The first thing to notice is that there's lots of noise around the trend line And what this shows what this empirically demonstrates is that GDP is not destiny At every level of GDP per capita there are opportunities for more social progress risks of less The second thing to notice is that for poor countries the curve is really steep So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP and if they reinvest that in doctors nurses water supplies sanitation etc。 there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck And that's good news and that's what we've seen over the last 20 30 years with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries But go on a bit further up the curve and then we see it flattening out Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress And with more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development I'll show you an example of Brazil Here's Brazil: social progress of about 70 out of 100 GDP per capita about 14，000 dollars a year And look Brazil's above the line Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress But where does Brazil go next Let's say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade But that is only half a plan It's less than half a plan because where does Brazil want to go on social progress Brazil it's possible to increase your growth increase your GDP while stagnating or going backwards on social progress We don't want Brazil to become like Russia What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its GDP so it becomes more like New Zealand And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it's not just growth alone it's growth with social progress And that's what the Social Progress Index does: It reframes the debate about development not just about GDP alone but inclusive sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people's lives And it's not just about countries Earlier this year with our friends from the Imazon nonprofit here in Brazil we launched the first subnational Social Progress Index We did it for the Amazon region It's an area the size of Europe 24 million people one of the most deprived parts of the country And here are the results and this is broken down into nearly 800 different municipalities And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country Imazon and other partners from government business and civil society can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives while protecting that precious global asset that is the Amazon Rainforest And this is just the beginning You can create a Social Progress Index for any state region city or municipality We all know and love TEDx; this is Social Pogress-x This is a tool for anyone to come and use Contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it GDP was not handed down from God on tablets of stone It's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century to address the challenges of the 20th century In the 21st century we face new challenges: aging obesity climate change and so on To face those challenges we need new tools of measurement new ways of valuing progress Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits charities volunteers civil society organizations really contribute to our society Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution but on their contribution to social progress Imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people's lives Imagine if we could work together government business civil society me you and make this century the century of social progress Thank you The first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford On his day off from work he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden That small scratch became infected Over the next few days his head was swollen with abscesses and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out and by February of 1941 this poor man was on the verge of dying He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford and fortunately for him a small team of doctors had managed to synthesize a very small amount of penicillin a drug that had been discovered 12 years before by Alexander Fleming but had never actually been used to treat a human and indeed no one even knew if the drug would work if it was full of impurities that would kill the patient but Florey and his team figured if they had to use it they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway So they gave Albert Alexander this Oxford policeman the drug and within 24 hours he started getting better His fever went down his appetite came back Second day he was doing much better They were starting to run out of penicillin so what they would do was run with his urine across the road to re-synthesize the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him and that worked Day four well on the way to recovery This was a miracle Day five they ran out of penicillin and the poor man died So that story didn't end that well but fortunately for millions of other people like this child who was treated again in the early 1940s who was again dying of a sepsis and within just six days you can see recovered thanks to this wonder drug penicillin Millions have lived and global health has been transformed Now antibiotics have been used for patients like this but they've also been used rather frivolously in some instances for treating someone with just a cold or the flu which they might not have responded to an antibiotic and they've also been used in large quantities sub-therapeutically which means in small concentrations to make chicken and hogs grow faster Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat we've spent a lot of antibiotics on animals not for treatment not for sick animals but primarily for growth promotion Now what did that lead us to Basically the massive use of antibiotics around the world has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria that resistance is now a problem because we've now selected for just the resistant bacteria And I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers you've seen this in every magazine that you come across but I really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem This is serious The next slide I'm about to show you is of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at this bug And you can see in 1999 this is the pattern of resistance mostly under about 10 percent across the United States Now watch what happens when we play the video So I don't know where you live but wherever it is it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in 1999 and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries and at the heart of it you might say well isn't this really just a medical issue If we taught doctors how not to use antibiotics as much if we taught patients how not to demand antibiotics perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics Now it turns out that there's something fundamental about antibiotics which makes it different from other drugs which is that if I misuse antibiotics or I use antibiotics not only am I affected but others are affected as well in the same way as if I choose to drive to work or take a plane to go somewhere that the costs I impose on others through global climate change go everywhere and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration This is what economists might call a problem of the commons and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case of antibiotics as well: that we don't consider and we including individuals patients hospitals entire health systems do not consider the costs that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used Now that's a problem that's similar to another area that we all know about which is of fuel use and energy and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as leads to local pollution and climate change And typically in the case of energy there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem One is we can make better use of the oil that we have and that's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics and we can do this in a number of ways that we'll talk about in a second but the other option is the drill baby drill option which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibiotics Now these are not separate They're related because if we invest heavily in new oil wells we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that's going to happen for antibiotics The reverse is also going to happen which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately we don't necessarily have to make the investments in new drug development And if you thought that these two were entirely fully balanced between these two options you might consider the fact that this is really a game that we're playing The game is really one of coevolution and coevolution is in this particular picture between cheetahs and gazelles Cheetahs have evolved to run faster because if they didn't run faster they wouldn't get any lunch Gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don't run faster they would be lunch Now this is the game we're playing against the bacteria except we're not the cheetahs we're the gazelles and the bacteria would just in the course of this little talk would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant just by selection and trial and error trying it over and over again Whereas how do we stay ahead of the bacteria We have drug discovery processes screening molecules we have clinical trials and then when we think we have a drug then we have the FDA regulatory process And once we go through all of that then we try to stay one step ahead of the bacteria Now this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well Now if you think about how we deal with energy pricing for instance we consider emissions taxes which means we're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately There are clean energy subsidies which are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much or perhaps don't need fossil fuels Now the analogy here is perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics and if you think about it what are good substitutes for antibiotics Well turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work so that could include improving hospital infection control or vaccinating people particularly against the seasonal influenza And the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use both in this country as well as in many other countries and that could really help A third option might include something like tradeable permits And these seem like faraway scenarios but if you consider the fact that we might not have antibiotics for many people who have infections we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics over others and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need but also on the basis of pricing And certainly consumer education works Very often people overuse antibiotics or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so and feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful both on energy When you tell someone that they're using a lot of energy during peak hour they tend to cut back and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics A hospital in St Louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used in the previous month and this was purely an informational feedback there was no shaming but essentially that provided some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics Now there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well If you look at the price of penicillin the cost per day is about 10 cents It's a fairly cheap drug If you take drugs that have been introduced since then linezolid or daptomycin those are significantly more expensive so to a world that has been used to paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics the idea of paying 180 dollars per day seems like a lot But what is that really telling us That price is telling us that we should no longer take cheap effective antibiotics as a given into the foreseeable future and that price is a signal to us that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation That price is also a signal that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal and an impetus to say the development of electric cars Prices are important signals and we need to pay attention but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics they're nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs which might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient's life forever So this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift and it's also a scary shift because in many parts of this country in many parts of the world the idea of paying 200 dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable So we need to think about that Now there are backstop options which is other alternative technologies that people are working on It includes bacteriophages probiotics quorum sensing synbiotics Now all of these are useful avenues to pursue and they will become even more lucrative when the price of new antibiotics starts going higher and we've seen that the market does actually respond and the government is now considering ways of subsidizing new antibiotics and development But there are challenges here We don't want to just throw money at a problem What we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics and that really is the challenge here Now going back to these technologies dinosaur film Nature will find a way So it's not as if these are permanent solutions We really have to remember that whatever the technology might be that nature will find some way to work around it You might think well this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria but it turns out that we have the exact same identical problem in many other fields as well with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis which is a serious problem in India and South Africa Thousands of patients are dying because the second-line drugs are so expensive and in some instances even those don't work and you have XDR TB Viruses are becoming resistant Agricultural pests Malaria parasites Right now much of the world depends on one drug artemisinin drugs essentially to treat malaria Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged and if this were to become widespread that puts at risk the single drug that we have to treat malaria around the world in a way that's currently safe and efficacious Mosquitos develop resistance If you have kids you probably know about head lice and if you're from New York City I understand that the specialty there is bedbugs So those are also resistant And we have to bring an example from across the pond Turns out that rats are also resistant to poisons Now what's common to all of these things is the idea that we've had these technologies to control nature only for the last 70 80 or 100 years and essentially in a blink we have squandered our ability to control because we have not recognized that natural selection and evolution was going to find a way to get back and we need to completely rethink how we're going to use measures to control biological organisms and rethink how we incentivize the development introduction in the case of antibiotics prescription and use of these valuable resources And we really now need to start thinking about them as natural resources And so we stand at a crossroads An option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business The alternative is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon Thank you Dre Urhahn: This theater is built on Copacabana which is the most famous beach in the world but 25 kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro and roughly 60，000 people live there Vila Cruzeiro from the news and unfortunately news from Vila Cruzeiro often where our story begins Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years ago we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas Now we learned that favelas are informal communities when immigrants from the countryside like cities within the cities known for problems like crime poverty police and the drug gangs these were communities that the people who lived there had built with their own hands without a master plan and like a giant work in progress Where we're from in Holland We even have rules for how to follow the rules DU: So the last day of filming we ended up and we had a drink and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses and most of these houses looked unfinished and they had walls of bare brick which were plastered and painted and suddenly we had this idea: what would it look like if all these houses And then we imagined one big design one big work of art in a place like this So we thought would that even be possible So first we started to count the houses but we soon lost count But somehow the idea stuck JK: We had a friend He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro His name was Nanko and he also liked the idea He said You know everybody here would pretty much love to have their houses It's when a house is finished So he introduced us to the right people and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here We made a few designs and everybody liked this design So we started painting and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue and we thought that looked already pretty good But they hated it The people who lived there really hated it They said What did you do You painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station In a favela that is not a good thing Also the same color as the prison cell So we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy and then we thought we were finished we were really happy but still it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us and they said You know there's a boy flying the kite but where is his kite We said Uh it's art You know you have to imagine the kite And they said No no no we want to see the kite So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill so that you could see the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite So the local news started writing about it which was great and then even The Guardian wrote about it: Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery JK: So encouraged by this success and we stumbled upon this street It was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides and somehow we saw a sort of river in it with koi carp swimming upstream So we decided to paint that river and we invited Rob Admiraal who is a tattoo artist and he specialized in the Japanese style So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor who lived nearby And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that lived on the street Elias told us that we could come and live in his house together with his family which was fantastic Unfortunately during that time and the drug gangs We learned that during those times people in communities really stick together during these times of hardship but we also learned a very important element the importance of barbecues Because when you throw a barbecue so we decided to throw one almost every other week and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood JK: We still had this idea of the hill though DU: Yeah yeah we were talking about the scale of this because this painting was incredibly big and it was insanely detailed and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves But we figured that maybe during this process all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself JK: So after all that time this hill this idea was still there and we started to make sketches models and we figured something out We figured that our ideas our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio which is called Santa Marta it's easier to get people to go along with this And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this And this image somehow went all over the world DU: So then we received an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program if this idea our approach if this would actually work in North Philly which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States So we immediately said yes We had no idea how but it seemed like a very interesting challenge so we did exactly the same as we did in Rio and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing So the project took almost two years to complete and we made individual designs for every single house on the avenue that we painted with the local store owners the building owners and a team of about a dozen young men and women They were hired and then they were trained as painters and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant patchwork of color And at the end the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment JK: So now we had painted a whole street How about we do this whole hill now We started looking for funding but instead we just ran into questions like how many houses are you going to paint How many square meters is that How much paint are you going to use and how many people are you going to employ And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer all those questions but then we thought in order to answer all those questions you have to know exactly what you're going to do before you actually get there and start about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own DU: So what we did is we decided to take this plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art And instead of looking for funding we started a crowdfunding campaign and donated over 100，000 dollars So for us this was an amazing moment because now because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground on up bottom up with no master plan JK: So we went back and we employed Angelo and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro very talented guy and he knows almost everybody there and then we employed Elias our former landlord who invited us into his house and he's a master of construction Together with them we decided where to start We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro and houses are being plastered as we speak And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next They're even printing t-shirts they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody and talking to the press This article about Angelo appeared DU: So while this is happening we are bringing this idea all over the world So like the project we did in Philadelphia we are also invited to do workshops for instance in Curaçao and right now we're planning a huge project in Haiti JK: So the favela was not only the place where this idea started: to work without a master plan because these communities are informal this was the inspiration and in a communal effort together with the people you can almost work like in an orchestra where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony DU: So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way and we are looking at continuing JK: Yeah And so one day pretty soon when the colors start going up on these walls we hope more people will join us and join this big dream and maybe one day the whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted DU: Thank you If there's any power in design that's the power of synthesis The more complex the problem the more the need for simplicity So allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design's power of synthesis Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization and even if counterintuitive it's good news Evidence shows that people are better off in cities But there's a problem that I would call the 3S menace: The scale speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon has no precedence in history For you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty By 2030 out of the five billion people that will be living in cities two billion are going to be under the line of poverty That means that we will have to build a one million-person city per week with 10，000 dollars per family during the next 15 years A one million-person city per week with 10，000 dollars per family If we don't solve this equation it is not that people will stop coming to cities They will come anyhow but they will live in slums favelas and informal settlements So what to do Well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves A clue could be in this question we were asked 10 years ago We were asked to accommodate 100 families that had been occupying illegally using a $10，000 subsidy with which we had to buy the land provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around 40 square meters And by the way they said than what social housing can normally afford Due to the difficulty of the question we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available there in the market Detached houses 30 families could be accommodated Row houses 60 families 100 families The only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height to go on a hunger strike as a solution expand So the conclusion with the families and this is important not our conclusion We had to innovate So what did we do lives reasonably well in around 80 square meters but when there's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house to 40 square meters what if instead of thinking of 40 square meters as a small house why don't we consider it half of a good one When you rephrase the problem instead of a small one the key question is which half do we do And we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won't be able to do individually We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house and we went back to the families to do two things: join forces and split tasks Our design was something in between a building and a house As a building it could pay for expensive well-located land and as a house it could expand to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs So we went from this initial social housing to a middle-class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks This was our first project in Iquique 10 years ago This is our last project in Chile Different designs same principle: You provide the frame and from then on families take over So the purpose of design to the 3S menace scale speed and scarcity is to channel people's own building capacity So with the right design slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution The second case is how design can contribute to sustainability In 2012 we entered the competition the right environment for knowledge creation It is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face-to-face contact it's important and we agreed on that But for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question with the right air So we asked ourselves: Does the typical office building help us in that sense Well how does that building look typically It's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with elevators stairs pipes wires everything and then a glass skin on the outside that due to direct sun radiation creates a huge greenhouse effect inside In addition to that let's say a guy goes every single day through the third floor but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on So we thought well maybe we have to turn this scheme inside out And what we did was let's have an open atrium a hollowed core the same collection of floors so that when the sun hits it's not impacting directly glass but a wall When you have an open atrium inside you are able to see what others are doing from within the building and you have a better way to control light in the perimeter then you are preventing direct sun radiation You may also open those windows and get cross-ventilation as elevated squares the entire height of the building None of this is rocket science You don't require sophisticated programming It's not about technology This is just archaic primitive common sense and by using common sense we went from 120 kilowatts which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year So with the right design of common sense against natural disasters You may know that Chile in 2010 earthquake and tsunami and we were called to work in the southern part of the country We were given 100 days three months to design almost everything from public buildings to public space street grid transportation housing and mainly how to protect the city against future tsunamis This was new in Chilean urban design Forbid installation on ground zero Thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the Japanese this may work but we know that in Chile this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable Second alternative: build a big wall the energy of the waves by big building companies because it meant 42 million dollars in contracts and was also politically preferred because it required no land expropriation But Japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless So this alternative was irresponsible As in the housing process in the way of finding a solution for this and we started a participatory design process In Spanish Loudspeaker: What kind of city do you want Vote for Constitución Go to the Open House and express your options Participate Fisherman: I am a fisherman Twenty-five fishermen work for me Where should I take them To the forest So why can't we have a concrete defense Done well of course I am the history of Constitución And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here My whole family has lived here I raised my children here and my children will also raise their children here and my grandchildren and everyone else will But why are you imposing this on me You You are imposing this on me In danger zone I am not authorized to build He himself is saying that No no no Nieves。。 Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie romantic kind of thing It is actually It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer what is the right question the wrong question So it was pretty obvious after this process that well we chicken out here or we go even further in asking what else is bothering you What other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city will have to be rethought from scratch And what they said was look fine to protect the city against future tsunamis we really appreciate but the next one is going to come in what 20 years But every single year we have problems In addition we are in the middle of the forest region of the country and our public space sucks It's poor and it's scarce And the origin of the city our identity is not really connected to the buildings that fell it is connected to the river but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative and our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers What if in between the city and the sea we have a forest a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature but dissipates it by introducing friction A forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding That may pay the historical debt of public space democratic access to the river So as a conclusion of the participatory design the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost: 48 million dollars in the public investment system and found out that there were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects The sum of them: 52 million dollars So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination By doing so we were able to save is today under construction So be it the force of self construction the force of common sense or the force of nature all these forces need to be translated into form and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement bricks or wood It is life itself Design's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put the force of life Thank you so much Fifty-four percent of the world's population lives in our cities In developing countries one third of that population is living in slums Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption occurs in our cities and 80 percent of gas emissions that cause global warming come from our cities as global problems like climate change the energy crisis or poverty are really in many ways city problems unless people who live in cities actually start doing a better job because right now we are not doing a very good one And that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of city life: first our citizens' willingness to engage with democratic institutions; second our cities' ability to really include all of their residents; and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives When it comes to engagement the data is very clear Voter turnout around the world peaked in the late '80s that we have never seen before and if those numbers are bad at the national level at the level of our cities they are just dismal In the last two years two of the world's most consolidated oldest democracies the U。S and France held nationwide municipal elections In France voter turnout hit a record low Almost 40 percent of voters decided not to show up In the U。S。 the numbers were even scarier In some American cities voter turnout was close to five percent I'll let that sink in for a second We're talking about democratic cities in which 95 percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders The city of L。A。 a city of four million people That was the lowest turnout the city had seen in 100 years Right here in my city of Rio in spite of mandatory voting almost 30 percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections When it comes to inclusiveness our cities are not the best cases of success either and again you don't need to look very far in order to find proof of that The city of Rio is incredibly unequal This is Leblon Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood And this is Complexo do Alemão This is where over 70，000 of the city's poorest residents live Leblon has an HDI a Human Development Index of 。967 That is higher than Norway Switzerland or Sweden Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of 。711 It sits somewhere in between the HDI of Algeria and Gabon So Rio like so many cities across the global South is a place where you can go from northern Europe in the space of 30 minutes If you drive that is If you take public transit it's about two hours cities with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places for human happiness to flourish We like being around people We are social animals Instead countries where urbanization for the past three decades and the main reason is this The American way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many and as a result they have seen a decline of relations of the things that make us happy Many studies show an increase in solitude and a decrease in solidarity honesty and social and civic participation So how do we start building cities that make us care Cities that value their most important asset: the incredible diversity Cities that make us happy what our cities look like then we really have to change the decision-making processes that have given us the results that we have right now We need a participation revolution and we need it fast The idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore People are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it's time to delegate that power to someone else If the protests that swept Brazil in June 2013 have taught us anything to exercise our power outside of an electoral context we are beaten up humiliated or arrested And this needs to change because when it does not only will people re-engage with the structures of representation but also complement these structures with direct effective and collective decision making by its very inclusive nature into better places for us to live But there is a catch obviously: Enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role by making it easier for people to organize communicate and make decisions at the same time Unfortunately for us when it comes to fostering democratic processes our city governments have not used technology to its full potential So far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city: potholes fallen trees or broken lamps They have also to a lesser extent invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice: I had to be in bed by 8 p。m。 but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas That's not participation and in fact governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters the way we allocate our budget the way we occupy our land and the way we manage our natural resources that can actually impact global problems that manifest themselves in our cities The good news is and I do have good news to share with you we don't need to wait for governments to do this I have reason to believe that it's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation Three years ago I cofounded an organization called Meu Rio and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio to organize around causes and places that they care about in their own city every day to a network of 160，000 citizens of Rio About 40 percent of those members are young people aged 20 to 29 That is one in every 15 young people of that age in Rio today Amongst our members is this adorable little girl Bia to your right and Bia was just 11 years old to save her model public school from demolition Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build I kid you not right before the event happened Bia started a campaign and we even watched her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring and many months afterwards the government changed their minds Bia's school stayed in place There's also Jovita She's an amazing woman whose daughter went missing about 10 years ago and since then she has been looking for her daughter In that process she found out that first she was not alone In the last year alone 2013 in the state of Rio Rio had no centralized intelligence system for solving missing persons cases In other Brazilian cities those systems have helped solve up to 80 percent of missing persons cases She started a campaign and after the secretary of security got 16，000 emails from people asking him to do this he responded and started to build a police unit specializing in those cases It was open to the public at the end of last month and Jovita was there giving interviews and being very fancy And then there is Leandro Leandro is an amazing guy in a slum in Rio and he created a recycling project in the slum At the end of last year December 16 he received an eviction order by the Rio de Janeiro state government giving him two weeks to leave the space that he had been using for two years The plan was to hand it over to a developer who planned to turn it into a construction site Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools the Pressure Cooker the same one that Bia and Jovita used and the state government changed their minds before Christmas Eve These stories make me happy but not just because they have happy endings They make me happy because they are happy beginnings The teacher and parent community at Bia's school is looking for other ways they could improve that space even further Leandro has ambitious plans to take his model to other low-income communities in Rio and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit that she helped created Bia Jovita and Leandro are living examples of something that citizens and city governments around the world need to know: We are ready As citizens we are ready to decide on our common destinies because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now With the Our Cities network the Meu Rio team hopes to share what we have learned similar initiatives in their own cities We have already started doing it in São Paulo with incredible results and want to take it to cities around the world through a network of citizen-centric citizen-led organizations that can inspire us challenge us and remind us to demand real participation in our city lives to decide whether we want schools or parking lots or construction sites loneliness or solidarity cars or buses and it is our responsibility to do that now and for the incredible creativity beauty and wonder that make our cities the greatest invention of our time Obrigado Thank you So this is Anna Hazare and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge digital activist in the world today And you wouldn't know it by looking at him Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian anticorruption and social justice activist And in 2011 he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in India a topic that Indian elites love to ignore So as part of this campaign he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good Gandhian organizer would use So he was on a hunger strike and Hazare realized through his hunger that actually maybe this time in the 21st century a hunger strike wouldn't be enough So he started playing around with mobile activism So the first thing he did is he said to people Okay why don't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption So he does this he gives people a short code and about 80，000 people do it Okay that's pretty respectable But then he decides Let me tweak my tactics a little bit He says Why don't you leave me a missed call Now for those of you who have lived in the global South you'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture I see people nodding People leave missed calls all the time: If you're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you're on the way you leave them a missed call If you're dating someone and you just want to say I miss you you leave them a missed call in some cultures if you want to please your lover you call them and hang up So why do people leave missed calls Well the reason of course is that they're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts So when Hazare asked people to leave him a missed call let's have a little guess how many people actually did this Thirty-five million So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history It's remarkable And this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging Indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring But he used that Hazare ended up with this massive CSV file of mobile phone numbers and he used that to deploy real people power on the ground to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi to make a national point of everyday corruption in India It's a really striking story So this is me when I was 12 years old I hope you see the resemblance And I was also an activist and I have been an activist all my life I had this really funny childhood where I traipsed around the world meeting world leaders and Noble prize winners talking about Third World debt as it was then called and demilitarization I was a very very serious child And back then in the early '90s I had a very cutting-edge tech tool of my own: the fax And the fax was the tool of my activism And at that time it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people all at once I'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran It was the eve of the Gulf War and I organized a global campaign to flood the hotel the Intercontinental in Geneva where James Baker and Tariq Aziz were meeting on the eve of the war and I thought if I could flood them with faxes we'll stop the war Well unsurprisingly that campaign was wholly unsuccessful There are lots of reasons for that but there's no doubt that one sputtering fax machine in Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint in terms of the ability to get a message to lots of people And so I went on to discover some better tools I cofounded Avaaz which uses the Internet to mobilize people and now has almost 40 million members and I now run Purpose which is a home for these kinds of technology-powered movements So what's the moral of this story Is the moral of this story you know what the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone This is another story of tech-determinism Well I would argue that there's actually more to it than that I'd argue that in the last 20 years something more fundamental has changed than just new tech I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world You ask any activist how to understand the world and they'll say Look at where the power is who has it how it's shifting And I think we all sense that something big is happening Henry's a fellow movement builder got talking one day and we started to think how can we make sense of this new world How can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful Because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society So I want to introduce you to this framework: Old power meet new power And I want to talk to you about what new power is today New power is the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination these are the two key elements And we see new power all around us This is Beppe Grillo he was a populist Italian blogger who with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools won more than 25 percent of the vote in recent Italian elections This is Airbnb which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate This is Kickstarter which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people Now we're familiar with all of these models But what's striking is the commonalities the structural features of these new models and how they differ from old power Let's look a little bit at this Old power is held like a currency New power works like a current Old power is held by a few New power isn't held by a few it's made by many Old power is all about download and new power uploads And you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace whether it's in media or politics or education So we've talked a little bit about what new power is Let's for a second talk about what new power isn't New power is not your Facebook page I assure you that having a social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad I assure you that his Facebook page has not embraced the power of participation New power is not inherently positive In fact this isn't an normative argument that we're making there are many good things about new power but it can produce bad outcomes More participation more peer coordination sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things like things for example in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near And thirdly new power is not the inevitable victor In fact unsurprisingly as many of these new power models get to scale what you see is this massive pushback from the forces of old power Just look at this really interesting epic struggle going on right now between Edward Snowden and the NSA You'll note that only one of the two people on this slide is currently in exile And so it's not at all clear that new power will be the inevitable victor That said keep one thing in mind: We're at the beginning of a very steep curve So you think about some of these new power models right These were just like someone's garage idea a few years ago and now they're disrupting entire industries And so what's interesting about new power is the way it feeds on itself Once you have an experience of new power you tend to expect and want more of it So let's say you've used a peer-to-peer lending platform like Lending Tree or Prosper then you've figured out that you don't need the bank and who wants the bank right And so that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more aspects of your life And what this gives rise to is a set of values We talked about the models that new power has engendered the Airbnbs the Kickstarters What about the values And this is an early sketch at what new power values look like New power values prize transparency above all else It's almost a religious belief in transparency a belief that if you shine a light on something it will be better And remember that in the 20th century this was not at all true People thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements New power values of informal networked governance New power folks would never have invented the U。N today for better or worse New power values participation and new power is all about do-it-yourself In fact what's interesting about new power is that it eschews some of the professionalization and specialization that was all the rage in the 20th century So what's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations So we've spent a bit of time thinking how can we plot organizations on a two-by-two where essentially we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit We started with a U。S analysis and let me show you some interesting findings So the first is Apple In this framework we actually described Apple as an old power company That's because the ideology the governing ideology of Apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in Cupertino It's absolutely about that beautiful perfect thing descending upon us in perfection And it does not value as a company transparency In fact it's very secretive Now Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world So this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy But one can argue that there's real vulnerabilites in that model I think another interesting comparison is that of the Obama campaign versus the Obama presidency Now I like President Obama but he ran with new power at his back right And he said to people we are the ones we've been waiting for And he used crowdfunding to power a campaign But when he got into office he governed like more or less all the other presidents did And this is a really interesting trend is when new power gets powerful what happens So this is a framework you should look at and think about where your own organization sits on it And think about where it should be in five or 10 years So what do you do if you're old power Well if you're there thinking in old power this won't happen to us Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopædia Britannica Let me tell you it's a very sad read But if you are old power the most important thing you can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you before you are occupied Imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization And ask them would they like what they see and should our model change What about if you're new power Is new power kind of just riding the wave to glory I would argue no I would argue that there are some very real challenges to new power in this nascent phase Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment Occupy was this incredible example of new power the purest example of new power And yet it failed to consolidate So the energy that it created was great for the meme phase but they were so committed to participation that they never got anything done And in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is: how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized One the other end of the spectra is Uber Uber is an amazing highly scalable new power model That network is getting denser and denser by the day But what's really interesting about Uber is it hasn't really adopted new power values This is a real quote from the Uber CEO recently: He says Once we get rid of the dude in the car he means drivers Uber will be cheaper Now new power models live and die by the strength of their networks By whether the drivers and the consumers Because they're not an exercise of top-down perfectionism they are about the network And so the challenge and this is why it's in no way surprising is that Uber's drivers are now unionizing It's extraordinary Uber's drivers are turning on Uber And the challenge for Uber this isn't an easy situation for them is that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture that is really old power They've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets Those markets expect a financial return and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your users and your drivers for more and more value and giving that value to your investors So the big question about the future of new power in my view is: Will that old power just emerge So will new power elites just become old power and squeeze Or will that new power base bite back Will the next big Uber be co-owned by Uber drivers And I think this going to be a very interesting structural question Finally think about new power being more than just an entity that scales things that make us have slightly better consumer experiences My call to action for new power is to not be an island We have major structural problems in the world today that could benefit enormously from the kinds of mass participation and peer coordination that these new power players know so well how to generate And we badly need them to turn their energies and their power to big what economists might call public goods problems that are often beyond markets where investors can easily be found And I think if we can do that we might be able to fundamentally change not only human beings' sense of their own agency and power because I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power is that people feel more powerful but we might also be able to change the way we relate to each other and the way we relate to authority and institutions And to me that's absolutely worth trying for Thank you very much Humanity takes center stage at TED but I would like to add a voice for the animals whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us Some years ago it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver His name is Jimmy Smith and he shared a story with me that is told among his people who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw Once upon a time he told me all animals on Earth were one Even though they look different on the outside inside they're all the same and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity When they arrived they would all take off their skins Raven shed his feathers bear his fur and salmon her scales and then they would dance But one day a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand Embarrassed the animals fled and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities all animals are one has been a powerful inspiration to me I like to get past the fur the feathers and the scales I want to get under the skin No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog my goal is to connect us with them eye to eye You may wonder do I ever photograph people Sure People are always present in my photos no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions You just have to learn how to look past their disguise As a photographer I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing When I use my camera I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are As animals blessed with the power of rational thought we can marvel at the intricacies of life As citizens of a planet in trouble it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life But as humans with hearts we can all rejoice in the unity of life and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave Let's find a way to join the dance Thank you I came here to show you the Fotokite It's a tethered flying camera But before I do that I want to tell you a bit about where it came from what motivated it So I was born in Russia and three years ago in 2011 there were the Russian federal elections There were massive irregularities reported and people came out to protest which was very unlikely for Russia And no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it Now there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby usually photographing things like the Sphinx the Pyramids who happened to be right around the corner and they flew a camera and they took some snapshots some panoramas of this demonstration Just completely independent entity completely random occurrence and the image when I saw it it really struck me Here's one of the panoramas So in a single image you can really see the scale of this event just the number of people the colors the banners You just can't consider this insignificant All in a single image which was really cool to me And I think in the future journalism and many other professions there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there but I think you wait a few months a few years and for many professions it's really going to be a requirement And it make sense It's such a unique perspective Nothing really communicates this scale for example in context in a way that this does But there are a few hurdles and they are quite basic and quite fundamental One is piloting So for this image they flew a camera a five kilogram device with an SLR under it It's quite heavy lots of spinning sharp things It's a bit uncomfortable to fly probably also for the operator In fact you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt it says No questions until landing in Russian and in English because people are curious and they'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen And these guys are great They're professionals; they're really careful in what they do So in the protests maybe you noticed they flew over the river so it was quite safe But this doesn't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions so we really have to make piloting easier The other problem is regulations or rather the lack of good regulation For many good reasons it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras So we already have cameras Everyone here I'm sure has a smartphone with a camera right There are more and more of them You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked You hear about actually a drone pilot a hobbyist was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach Here's some personal input I didn't expect Just yesterday I was attacked by a guy who claimed that I was filming him I was checking my email right here easy way to get input for your talk But I think there are better solutions I think we have to defuse the situation We have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues but still give us that perspective And this is one potential solution So this is the Fotokite Well let me see it's a quadrocopter but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash It's literally a dog leash It's very convenient And the neat thing about it is to fly it there's no joysticks nothing like this You just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly You give it a little twist That's kind of the way you communicate And there it goes So the interaction is super simple It's like a personal flying pet It just always maintains a certain angle to you and if I move around with it it'll actually follow me naturally And of course we can build on top of this So this leash has some additional electronics You can turn it on And now it's like telling your dog to fly lower if you have such a dog So I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily So I just shifted its position And it's really safe I don't know about you guys in the front row but at least in principle you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection Live demos are hard right Things go wrong all the time But no matter what this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you What's more it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device You don't have to look for someone controlling it Now I can tell you that it's easy a lot but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one and launch it And if I can do this on stage live then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices So now we have two eyes in the sky And now the trick is getting them back So my question now to you is well it's a nice solution it's very accessible it's safe What would you use it for What would you use such a camera for in your life Thank you Let me tell you a story about a little girl named Naghma Naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters Every morning her father would wake up in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars The winter was very harsh and unfortunately Naghma's brother died and her mother became very ill In desperation her father went to a neighbor to borrow 2，500 dollars After several months of waiting the neighbor became very impatient and he demanded that he be paid back Unfortunately Naghma's father didn't have the money and so the two men agreed to a jirga So simply put a jirga is a form of mediation that's used in Afghanistan's informal justice system It's usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan where there's deep-seated resentment against the formal system At the jirga the men sat together and they decided that the best way to satisfy the debt would be if Naghma married the neighbor's 21-year-old son She was six Now stories like Naghma's unfortunately are all too common and from the comforts of our home we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women's rights And if you watched Afghanistan on the news you may have this view that it's a failed state However Afghanistan does have a legal system and while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs even in jirgas laws are supposed to be followed and it goes without saying that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral it's illegal In 2008 I went to Afghanistan for a justice funded program and I went there originally on this nine-month program to train Afghan lawyers In that nine months I went around the country and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up and I talked to many businesses that were also operating in Afghanistan And within these conversations I started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused And so this put me on a quest for justness and what justness means to me is using laws for their intended purpose which is to protect The role of laws is to protect So as a result I decided to open up a private practice and I became the first foreigner to litigate in Afghan courts Throughout this time I also studied many laws I talked to many people I read up on many cases and I found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in Afghanistan but it's a global problem And while I originally shied away from representing human rights cases because I was really concerned about how it would affect me both professionally and personally I decided that the need for justness was so great that I couldn't continue to ignore it And so I started representing people like Naghma pro bono also Now since I've been in Afghanistan and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years I've represented from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma and with much success And the reason for my success is very simple: I work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used I find that achieving justness in places like Afghanistan is difficult and there's three reasons The first reason is that simply put people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were and I find that this is a global problem The second issue is that even with laws on the books it's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs like in the first jirga that sold Naghma off And the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good existing laws on the books there aren't people or lawyers that are willing to fight for those laws And that's what I do: I use existing laws often unused laws and I work those to the benefits of my clients We all need to create a global culture of human rights and be investors in a global human rights economy and by working in this mindset we can significantly improve justice globally Now let's get back to Naghma Several people heard about this story and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $2，500 debt And it's not just that simple; you can't just throw money at this problem and think that it's going to disappear That's not how it works in Afghanistan So I told them I'd get involved but in order to get involved what needed to happen is a second jirga needed to be called a jirga of appeals And so in order for that to happen we needed to get the village elders together we needed to get the tribal leaders together the religious leaders Naghma's father needed to agree the neighbor needed to agree and also his son needed to agree And I thought if I'm going to get involved in this thing then they also need to agree that I preside over it So after hours of talking and tracking them down and about 30 cups of tea they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga and we did And what was different about the second jirga is this time we put the law at the center of it and it was very important for me that they all understood that Naghma had a right to be protected And at the end of this jirga it was ordered by the judge that the first decision was erased and that the $2，500 debt was satisfied and we all signed a written order where all the men acknowledged that what they did was illegal and if they did it again that they would go to prison Thanks And most importantly the engagement was terminated and Naghma was free Protecting Naghma and her right to be free protects us Now with my job there's above-average amount of risks that are involved I've been temporarily detained I've been accused of running a brothel accused of being a spy I've had a grenade thrown at my office It didn't go off though But I find that with my job that the rewards far outweigh the risks and as many risks as I take my clients take far greater risks because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard or worse if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer With every case that I take I realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients that they're also standing behind me and that's what keeps me going Law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us Journalists are very vital in making sure that that information is given to the public Too often we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given This picture is a picture of the British press corps in Afghanistan It was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill According to the Committee to Protect Journalists since 2010 there have been thousands of journalists who have been threatened injured killed detained Too often when we get this information we forget who it affects or how that information is given to us What many journalists do both foreign and domestic is very remarkable especially in places like Afghanistan and it's important that we never forget that because what they're protecting is not only our right to receive that information but also the freedom of the press which is vital to a democratic society Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan He works for The New York Times and unfortunately a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government As a result he was temporarily detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country I represent Matt and after dealing with the government I was able to get legal acknowledgment that in fact he was illegally exiled and that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan and there's consequences if that's not followed And I'm happy to say that as of a few days ago the Afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him If you censor one journalist then it intimidates others and soon nations are silenced It's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent Protecting journalists and our right to receive information protects us Our world is changing We live in a different world now and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us Two weeks ago Afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected president Ashraf Ghani which is huge and I'm very optimistic about him and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan the changes that it needs especially within the legal sector We live in a different world We live in a world where my eight-year-old daughter only knows a black president There's a great possibility that our next president will be a woman and as she gets older she may question can a white guy be president Our world is changing and we need to change with it and what were once individual problems are problems for all of us According to UNICEF there are currently over 280 million boys and girls who are married under the age of 15 Two hundred and eighty million Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle of poverty poor health lack of education At the age of 12 Sahar was married She was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother When she went to her in-laws' house they forced her into prostitution Because she refused she was tortured She was severely beaten with metal rods They burned her body They tied her up in a basement and starved her They used pliers to take out her fingernails At one point she managed to escape from this torture chamber to a neighbor's house and when she went there instead of protecting her they dragged her back to her husband's house and she was tortured even worse When I met first Sahar thankfully Women for Afghan Women gave her a safe haven to go to As a lawyer I try to be very strong for all my clients because that's very important to me but seeing her how broken and very weak as she was was very difficult It took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her when she was in that house but finally she started opening up to me and when she opened up what I heard was she didn't know what her rights were but she did know she had a certain level of protection by her government that failed her and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were And so we decided to take this case to the Supreme Court Now this is extremely significant because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer a law that's been on the books for years and years but until Sahar had never been used In addition to this we also decided to sue for civil damages again using a law that's never been used but we used it for her case So there we were at the Supreme Court arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices me as an American female lawyer and Sahar a young woman who when I met her couldn't speak above a whisper She stood up she found her voice and my girl told them that she wanted justice and she got it At the end of it all the court unanimously agreed that her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack existing bad practices by using the laws in the ways that they're intended to be used and by protecting Sahar we are protecting ourselves After having worked in Afghanistan for over six years now a lot of my family and friends think that what I do looks like this But in all actuality what I do looks like this Now we can all do something I'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy We can create a culture of transparency and accountability to the laws and make governments more accountable to us as we are to them A few months ago a South African lawyer visited me in my office and he said I wanted to meet you I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like The laws are ours and no matter what your ethnicity nationality gender race they belong to us Businesses also need to get with the program A corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses and whether you're a business an NGO or a private citizen rule of law benefits all of us And by working together with a concerted mindset through the people public and private sector we can create a global human rights economy and all become global investors in human rights And by doing this we can achieve justness together Thank you George and Charlotte Blonsky who were invented something This device consists of a large round table and some machinery she lies on her back she is strapped

the answer to that is because their brains are packaged inside their skulls in a way different from the way our brains we being human beings true have our brains packaged will peck they will bang their head And as far as anyone knows Their brain is packed in very tightly at least for blows coming right from the front Not too many people paid attention to this research until the last few years when in this country especially people are becoming curious about what happens to the brains of football players who bang their heads repeatedly And the woodpecker maybe relates to that There was a paper published in the medical journal The Lancet in England a few years ago called received this patient and didn't really know what to do about it The man had cut his finger he worked processing chickens So bad that when he got in a room with the doctors and the nurses they couldn't stand being in the room with him It was intolerable They tried every drug every other treatment they could think of After a year he still smelled putrid After two years still smelled putrid Three years four years still smelled putrid After five years it went away on its own It's a mystery In New Zealand Dr Lianne Parkin and her team tested an old tradition in her city They live in a city that has huge hills San Francisco-grade hills And in the winter there it gets very cold and very icy There are lots of injuries The tradition that they tested they tested by asking people to stop and try something out Try one of two conditions The tradition is that in the winter in that city you wear your socks on the outside of your boots and it was quite graphic when they saw it was that it's true you're much more likely to survive and not slip and fall Now I hope you will agree with me that these things I've just described to you each of them deserves some kind of prize And that's what they got each of them got an Ig Nobel prize In 1991 I together with bunch of other people started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony It's that you've done something that makes people laugh and then think What you've done makes people laugh and then think Whatever it is there's something about it their only possible reaction is to laugh And then a week later it's still rattling around in their heads and all they want to do is tell their friends about it That's the quality we look for Every year we get in the neighborhood of 9，000 new nominations for the Ig Nobel prize and 20 percent of those nominations are people who nominate themselves Those self-nominees almost never win It's very difficult numerically to win a prize if you want to Even if you don't want to it's very difficult numerically to win an Ig Nobel prize We offer them the chance to decline decides to accept What do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize Well you get several things You get an Ig Nobel prize The design is different every year You're looking at a picture of the prize we gave last year 2013 Most prizes in the world also give their winners some cash some money We don't have any money so we can't give them In fact the winners have to pay their own way to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony which most of them do received from us 10 trillion dollars A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe You may remember that Zimbabwe had a little adventure for a few years there of inflation They ended up printing bills that were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars The man responsible who runs the national bank there by the way won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics The other thing you win is an invitation to come to the ceremony which happens at Harvard University you come to Harvard's biggest meeting place and classroom It fits 1，100 people it's jammed to the gills and up on the stage waiting to shake your hand are a bunch of Nobel prize winners That's the heart of the ceremony I am going to tell you about just a very few of the other medical-related prizes we've given Keep in mind we've given 230 prizes There are lots of these people who walk among you Maybe you have one A paper was published about 30 years ago It was written by Dr Peter Barss who is Canadian Dr Barss came to the ceremony and explained that as a young doctor he wanted to see the world So he went to Papua New Guinea what kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital He looked through the records and he discovered that a surprisingly large number of people in that hospital were there because of injuries due to falling coconuts One typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands where there are not many coconut trees down to visit their relatives on the coast where there are lots And they'll think that a coconut tree A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall and has coconuts that weigh two pounds that can drop off at any time one way or another Or in some cases one way and another They in these papers how to minimize the chance Dr Emmanuel Ben-Soussan one of the authors that in the 1950s people were figuring out how to do it well And there were some difficulties at first The basic problem I'm sure you're familiar with They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly Now it's rare that patients will explode The final thing that I want to tell you about is a prize that in an emergency One to save your life one to save the life of some lucky bystander Why would someone do this you might wonder and she explained that she grew up in Ukraine And they later discovered that a lot of the worst medical problems came from the particles people breathed in So she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens Years later she moved to America She had a baby One day she looked and on the floor her infant son had picked up her bra and had her bra on his face And that's where the idea came from with the first prototype of the bra Paul Krugman Nobel laureate in economics Wolfgang Ketterle Nobel laureate in physics I myself own an emergency bra It's my favorite bra but I would be happy to share it with any of you should the need arise Thank you I have a confession to make I am addicted to adventure and as a young boy I would rather look outside the window at the birds in the trees and the sky than looking at that two-dimensional chalky blackboard where time stands still and even sometimes dies My teachers thought there was something wrong with me because I wasn't paying attention in class They didn't find anything specifically wrong with me other than being slightly dyslexic because I'm a lefty But they didn't test for curiosity Curiosity to me is about our connection with the world with the universe It's about seeing what's around that next coral head or what's around that next tree and learning more not only about our environment but about ourselves Now my dream of dreams I want to go explore the oceans of Mars but until we can go there I think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets As a matter of fact if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is and dissect it into a living space the ocean represents over 3。4 billion cubic kilometers of volume within which we've explored less than five percent And I look at this and I go well there are tools to go deeper longer and further: submarines ROVs even Scuba diving But if we're going to explore the final frontier on this planet we need to live there We need to build a log cabin if you will at the bottom of the sea And so there was a great curiosity in my soul when I went to go visit a TED Prize winner by the name of Dr Sylvia Earle Maybe you've heard of her Two years ago she was staked out at the last undersea marine laboratory to try and save it to try and petition for us not to scrap it and bring it back on land We've only had about a dozen or so scientific labs at the bottom of the sea There's only one left in the world: it's nine miles offshore and 65 feet down It's called Aquarius Aquarius in some fashion is a dinosaur an ancient robot chained to the bottom this Leviathan In other ways it's a legacy And so with that visit I realized that my time is short if I wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut When we swam towards this after many moons of torture and two years of preparation this habitat waiting to invite us was like a new home And the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside It wasn't about living at something the size of a school bus It was about giving us the luxury of time outside to wander to explore to understand more about this oceanic final frontier We had megafauna come and visit us This spotted eagle ray is a fairly common sight in the oceans But why this is so important why this picture is up is because this particular animal brought his friends around and instead of being the pelagic animals that they were they started getting curious about us these new strangers that were moving into the neighborhood doing things with plankton We were studying all sorts of animals and critters and they got closer and closer to us and because of the luxury of time these animals these residents of the coral reef were starting to get used to us and these pelagics that normal travel through stopped This particular animal actually circled for 31 full days during our mission So mission 31 wasn't so much about breaking records It was about that human-ocean connection Because of the luxury of time we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we've never seen before It's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys Of course just like any neighbor after a while if they get tired the goliath grouper barks at us and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second For us it's just telling us to go back into the habitat and leave them alone Now this wasn't just about adventure There was actually a serious note to it We did a lot of science and again because of the luxury of time in 31 days In this particular case we were using a PAM or let me just see if I can get this straight a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer And our scientists from FIU MIT and from Northeastern were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do when we're not around The Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer or PAM gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools such as this sonde or what I like to call the sponge proctologist whereby the sonde itself tests for metabolism rates in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge or the redwoods of the ocean And this gives us a much better gauge of what's happening underwater with regard to climate change-related issues and how the dynamics of that affect us here on land And finally we looked at predator-prey behavior And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing because as we take away some of the predators on these coral reefs around the world the prey or the forage fish act very differently What we realized is not only do they stop taking care of the reef darting in grabbing a little bit of algae and going back into their homes they start spreading out and disappearing from those particular coral reefs Well within that 31 days we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers on each one of these topics But the point of adventure is not only to learn it's to be able to share that knowledge with the world and with that thanks to a couple of engineers at MIT we were able to use a prototype camera called the Edgertronic to capture slow-motion video up to 20，000 frames per second in a little box that's worth 3，000 dollars It's available to every one of us And that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye Let me show you a quick video of what this camera does You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for 31 days and never normally would have paid attention to such as hermit crabs Now using a cutting-edge piece of technology that's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy We sometimes had to put the camera upside down cordon it back to the lab and actually man the trigger from the lab itself But what this gives us is the foresight to look at and analyze in scientific and engineering terms some of the most amazing behavior that the human eye just can't pick up such as this manta shrimp trying to catch its prey within about 。3 seconds That punch is as strong as a 。22 caliber bullet and if you ever try to catch a bullet in mid-flight with your eye impossible But now we can see things such as these Christmas tree worms pulling in and fanning out in a way that the eye just can't capture or in this case a fish throwing up grains of sand This is an actual sailfin goby and if you look at it in real time it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion because it's so quick One of the most precious gifts that we had underwater is that we had WiFi and for 31 days straight we were able to connect with the world in real time from the bottom of the sea and share all of these experiences Quite literally right there I am Skyping in the classroom with one of the six continents and some of the 70，000 students that we connected every single day to some of these experiences As a matter of fact I'm showing a picture that I took with my smartphone from underwater of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom We had never seen that before And I dream of the day that we have underwater cities and maybe just maybe if we push the boundaries of adventure and knowledge and we share that knowledge with others out there we can solve all sorts of problems My grandfather used to say People protect what they love My father How can people protect what they don't understand And I've thought about this my whole life Nothing is impossible We need to dream we need to be creative and we all need to have an adventure in order to create miracles in the darkest of times And whether it's about climate change or eradicating poverty or giving back to future generations what we've taken for granted it's about adventure And who knows maybe there will be underwater cities and maybe some of you will become the future aquanauts Thank you very much Technology has brought us so much: the moon landing the Internet the ability to sequence the human genome But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears and about 30 years ago the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called Amusing Ourselves to Death which lays this out really brilliantly And here's what he said of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley He said Orwell feared we would become Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture Orwell feared the truth would be in a sea of irrelevance Big Brother watching you and you watching Big Brother But it doesn't have to be this way We are not passive consumers of data and technology We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it but to do that we have to pay as much attention to how we think as how we code We have to ask questions and hard questions to move past counting things to understanding them We're constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it size isn't everything There's also the speed at which it moves and the many varieties of data types and here are just a few examples: images text video audio And what unites this disparate types of data is that they're created by people and they require context Now there's a group of data scientists and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory and they've been working with the Centers for Disease Control to better understand how people talk about quitting smoking how they talk about electronic cigarettes and what they can do collectively to help them quit The interesting thing is if you want to understand how people talk about smoking first you have to understand what they mean when they say smoking And on Twitter there are four main categories: number one smoking cigarettes; number two smoking marijuana; number three smoking ribs; and number four smoking hot women So then you have to think about well how do people talk about electronic cigarettes And there are so many different ways it's a complex kind of a query language is created by people and people are messy and we're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this 24/7 in many many languages and then as soon as we figure it out we change it up So did these ads that the CDC put on these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing did they actually have an impact on whether people quit And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data but they were able to conclude that those advertisements and you may have seen them that they had the effect of jolting people into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior And what I admire and appreciate about this project aside from the fact including the fact that it's based on real human need is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance And so it's not just big data that causes challenges of interpretation because let's face it we human beings have a very rich history of taking any amount of data no matter how small So many years ago you may remember that former President Ronald Reagan was very criticized for making a statement that facts are stupid things And it was a slip of the tongue let's be fair He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials But I actually think there's because facts are stubborn things but sometimes they're stupid too I want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me I need to take a breath My son Isaac when he was two was diagnosed with autism and he was this happy hilarious loving affectionate little guy but the metrics on his developmental evaluations which looked at things like the number of words at that point none communicative gestures and minimal eye contact put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby And the diagnosis was factually correct but it didn't tell the whole story And about a year and a half later when he was almost four I found him in front of the computer one day running a Google image search on women And I did what any obsessed parent would do which is immediately started hitting the back button to see what else he'd been searching for And they were in order: men school bus and computer And I was stunned because we didn't know that he could spell much less read and so I asked him Isaac how did you do this And he looked at me very seriously and said Typed in the box He was teaching himself to communicate but we were looking in the wrong place and this is what happens when assessments and analytics overvalue one metric in this case verbal communication and undervalue others such as creative problem-solving Communication was hard for Isaac and so he found a workaround to find out what he needed to know And when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex process but he could get himself a lot of the way there by putting a word in a search box And so this little moment had a really profound impact on me and our family because it helped us change our frame of reference for what was going on with him and worry a little bit less and appreciate his resourcefulness more And they're vulnerable to misuse willful or otherwise I have a friend Emily Willingham who's a scientist It's quite a list The Internet blamed for everything right And of course mothers because And actually wait there's more there's a whole bunch in the mother category here And you can see it's a pretty rich and interesting list The final one is interesting because the term refrigerator mother for the cause of autism and that meant somebody who was cold and unloving And at this point you might be thinking Okay Susan we get it you can take data you can make it mean anything And this is true it's absolutely true but the challenge is that to try to make meaning out of it ourselves because frankly data doesn't create meaning We do So as businesspeople as consumers as patients as citizens we have a responsibility I think to spend more time focusing on our critical thinking skills Why many times over we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly efficiently and with far greater impact than we did in the past Great right And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology and the social sciences rhetoric philosophy ethics because they give us context that is so important for big data and because they help us become better critical thinkers Because after all if I can spot a problem in an argument it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers And this means teaching ourselves to find those confirmation biases and false correlations and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal from 30 yards because something that happens after something doesn't mean it happened because of it necessarily and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second the Romans called this post hoc ergo propter hoc after which therefore because of which Why Because they're based on assumptions about who we all are based on our gender and our age and where we live as opposed to data on what we actually think and do And since we have this data we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls and consumer opt-in and beyond that we need to be clear about our hypotheses and our confidence in the result As my high school algebra teacher used to say show your math because if I don't know what steps you took I don't know what steps you didn't take and if I don't know what questions you asked I don't know what questions you didn't ask And it means asking ourselves really the hardest question of all: Did the data really show us this or does the result make us feel more successful and more comfortable So the Health Media Collaboratory at the end of their project they were able to find that 87 percent of tweets that they actually made people stop smoking No It's science not magic So if we are to unlock the power of data we don't have to go blindly into Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future or Huxley's vision of a trivial one or some horrible cocktail of both What we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect like the Health Media Collaboratory and as they say in the superhero movies let's use our powers for good Thank you I know a man who soars above the city every night In his dreams he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the Earth Everything has motion he claims even a body as paralyzed as his own This man is my father Three years ago when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute and found him lying deathly still tethered to a breathing machine Paralysis had closed over his body slowly beginning in his toes then legs torso fingers and arms It made its way up his neck cutting off his ability to breathe and stopped just beneath the eyes He never lost consciousness Rather he watched from within as his body shut down limb by limb muscle by muscle In that ICU room I walked up to my father's body and with a quivering voice and through tears I began reciting the alphabet A B C D E F G H I J K At K he blinked his eyes I began again A B C D E F G H I He blinked again at the letter I then at T then at R and Kitra He said Kitra my beauty don't cry This is a blessing There was no audible voice but my father called out my name powerfully Just 72 hours after his stroke he had already embraced the totality of his condition Despite his extreme physical state he was completely present with me guiding nurturing and being my father as much if not more than ever before Locked-in syndrome is many people's worst nightmare In French it's sometimes called maladie de l'emmuré vivant Literally walled-in-alive disease For many people perhaps most paralysis is an unspeakable horror but my father's experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped but rather of turning the psyche inwards dimming down the external chatter facing the recesses of his own mind and in that place falling in love with life and body anew As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body life and death the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine Paradise is in this body It's in this world he said I slept by my father's side for the first four months tending as much as I could to his every discomfort understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help My mother sisters brother and I we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing We became his mouthpiece spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye His room it became our temple of healing His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel and through us my father was able to speak and uplift letter by letter blink by blink Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din drama and death of the hospital ward faded into the background I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke He composed a letter addressing his synagogue congregation and ended it with the following lines: When my nape exploded I entered another dimension: inchoate sub-planetary protozoan Universes are opened and closed continually There are many when low who stop growing Last week I was brought so low but I felt the hand of my father around me and my father brought me back When we weren't his voice we were his legs and arms I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face bending each joint to keep it soft and limber I'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion to watch from within as the finger curled and extended and to move along with it in his mind Then one day from the corner of my eye I saw his body slither like a snake an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs At first I thought it was my own hallucination having spent so much time tending to this one body so desperate to see anything react on its own But he told me he felt tingles sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin The following week he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance Connections were being made Body was slowly and gently reawakening limb by limb muscle by muscle twitch by twitch As a documentary photographer I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn I photographed him taking his first unaided breath the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine I wasn't able to portray his story from within and so I began to search for a new visual language one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience Finally I want to share with you that tries to express the slow in-between existence that my father has experienced As he began to regain his ability to breathe I started recording his thoughts and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe you're paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic I don't In my mind and in my dreams every night I Chagall-man float over the city twirl and swirl with my toes kissing the floor I know nothing about the statement of man without motion Everything has motion The heart pumps The body heaves The mouth moves We never stagnate Life triumphs up and down Kitra Cahana: For most of us our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths and dreams about crawling back home So begins life at 57 he says A toddler has no attitude in its being but a man insists on his world every day Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable but my father insists that there are no dead ends Instead he invites me into his space of co-healing to give the very best of myself and for him to give the very best of himself to me Paralysis was an opening for him It was an opportunity to emerge to rekindle life force to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation Today my father is no longer locked in He moves his neck with ease has had his feeding peg removed breathes with his own lungs speaks slowly with his own quiet voice and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body But the work will never be finished As he says I'm living in a broken world and there is holy work to do Thank you So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference and making a difference starts with telling their stories So when I meet refugees I always ask them questions Who bombed your house Who killed your son Did the rest of your family make it out alive How are you coping in your life in exile But there's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing and that is: What did you take What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town and the armed gangs were approaching your house A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger He took his high school diploma and later he told me why He said I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it And he would risk his life to get that diploma On his way to school he would dodge snipers His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling and his mother told me Every day I would say to him every morning 'Honey please don't go to school。' And when he insisted she said I would hug him as if it were for the last time But he said to his mother We're all afraid but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear But one day the family got terrible news Hany's aunt his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house Their throats were slit It was time to flee They left that day right away in their car Hany hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers And they would cross the border into Lebanon where they would find peace But they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field and this is Hany's brother Ashraf who plays outside And that day they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world in a country Lebanon that is tiny It only has four million citizens and there are one million Syrian refugees living there that is not host to Syrian refugees This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable Think about it this way proportionately It would be as if the entire population of Germany 80 million people would flee to the United States in just three years Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted most of them inside the country Six and a half million people have fled for their lives Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries and only a small proportion as you see have moved on to Europe What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children I took this picture of this little girl It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan And most troubling of all is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon And yet Syrian refugee children all refugee children tell us rather than the nightmare of their past I'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq and I met this girl and I thought She's beautiful and I went up to her and asked her Can I take your picture And she said yes but she refused to smile I think she couldn't because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children a generation isolated and frustrated And yet look at what they fled: utter destruction buildings industries schools roads homes Hany's home was also destroyed This will need to be rebuilt by architects by engineers by electricians Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge Shouldn't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake the societies in exile the refugees Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state Well far from it is 17 years Hany was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently and we conducted our entire conversation in English which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown's novels and from listening to American rap We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf But I'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day He said to me If I am not a student I am nothing Hany is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced So while we're making sweeping progress in human health in technology in education and design we are doing dangerously little to help the victims and we are doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes And there are more and more victims Every day on average by the end of this day 32，000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes 32，000 people They flee across borders like this one We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan and this is a typical day Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats risking their lives in this case just to reach safety in Europe This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized most of the people drowned and he told us Syrians are just looking for a quiet place where nobody hurts you where nobody humiliates you Well I think that should be the minimum How about a place of healing of learning and even opportunity Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally that 86 percent the vast majority of refugees are living in the developing world in countries struggling with their own insecurity with their own issues of helping their own populations and poverty So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees And all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border Thank you But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive We can help them thrive We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end Rather as centers of excellence where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation It makes so much sense that has been raging on for 22 years And imagine living in this camp I visited this camp It's in Djibouti neighboring Somalia and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there It was dusty and it was terribly hot And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children and then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter and I went up and talked to her And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids like What is your favorite subject and What do you want to be when you grow up And this is when her face turned blank and she said to me I have no future My schooling days are over And I thought there must be some misunderstanding so I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp And how I wished at that moment that I could say to her We will build you a school And I also thought what a waste She should be and she is the future of Somalia A boy named Jacob Atem terribly tragedy He watched this is in Sudan burned to the ground and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family were killed that day Only his cousin survived and the two of them walked for seven months this is boys like him chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs where they found safety and he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States and he found love in a foster family and he was able to go to school and he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university I spoke to him on Skype the other day and he was in his new university in Florida pursuing his Ph。D in public health enough funds from the American public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home So I want to take you back to Hany When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me He wrote: I miss myself my friends times of reading novels or writing poems birds and tea in the morning My room my books myself and everything that was making me smile Oh oh I had so many dreams that were about to be realized So here is my point: Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity Leave them abandoned and they risk exploitation and abuse and leave them unskilled and uneducated and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence Hany is at a tipping point We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life: tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets food rations and a bit of medicine University is a luxury and he will become a member of a lost generation Hany's story is a tragedy but it doesn't have to end that way Thank you Almost a year ago my aunt started suffering back pains She went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost 30 years They recommended that she do some therapy but after a while she wasn't feeling better so the doctors decided to do further tests They did an x-ray and discovered an injury in her lungs and at the time they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs but after a few weeks of treatment So finally they decided to do a biopsy the results of the biopsy came back It was stage 3 lung cancer Her lifestyle was almost free of risk She never smoked a cigarette she never drank alcohol and she had been playing sports for almost half her life Perhaps that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed My story might be unfortunately familiar to most of you One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer and one out of four will die because of it Not only did that cancer diagnosis change the life of our family but that process of going back and forth with new tests different doctors describing symptoms discarding diseases over and over was stressful and frustrating especially for my aunt And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done since the beginning of history We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer but we still have 20th-century procedures and processes for diagnosis if any Today most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is wrong Today the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it We know that we can change this in our lifetime and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and monitoring the appropriate response at the molecular level easier cheaper smarter and more accessible than ever before The context of course is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates and the biological realm is no exception It is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers But progress in biotech is not only being accelerated it is also being democratized Just as personal computers or the Internet or smartphones leveled the playing field for entrepreneurship politics or education recent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches We are a team of scientists and technologists from Chile Panama Mexico Israel and Greece and based on recent scientific discoveries we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer I need to start with proteins because when cancer is present in our body protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells As you might know proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA but before a protein is expressed or produced relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression Unlike DNA which is mainly fixed microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer because as you know cancer is a disease of altered gene expression It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique specific pattern for each type of cancer even at the early stages reflecting the progression of the disease and whether it's responding to medication or in remission making microRNAs a perfect highly sensitive biomarker However the problem with microRNAs is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology to detect them in a reliable way because they are very short sequences of nucleotides much smaller than DNA And also all microRNAs are very similar to each other with just tiny differences So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules extremely similar extremely small Let me do a demonstration Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test a lab technician extracts a total RNA which is quite simple today and puts it in a standard 96-well plate like this one Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign that is looking for a specific microRNA acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample and when it does it will shine with green color To run the reaction you put the plate inside a device like this one and then you can put your smartphone on top of it If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera good enough for our purpose The smartphone is taking pictures and when the reaction is over it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation This entire process lasts around 60 minutes but when the process is over wells that shine are matched with the specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine And then when this entire process is over this is what happens This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time Then if we take this specific pattern of microRNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microRNA patterns with a specific presence of a disease this is how pancreatic cancer looks like This inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information If we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer we need to stop treating them as acute isolated episodes and consider and measure everything that affects our health on a permanent basis This entire platform is a working prototype It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology a low-cost 3D-printed device and data science to try to tackle one of humanity's toughest challenges Since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized this entire solution costs at least 50 times less than current available methods and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more so we're making the design of the device open-source Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages but so far we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer lung cancer breast cancer and hepatic cancer And currently we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer This is the single non-invasive accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for You don't need to have any symptoms You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools Today cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear That is at stage 3 or 4 and I believe that is too late It is too expensive for our families It is too expensive for humanity We cannot lose the war against cancer It not only costs us billions of dollars but it also costs us the people we love Today my aunt she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude However I want fights like this to become very rare I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages and I'm certain that in the very near future because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences the way we see cancer will radically change understanding it better and finding a cure Thank you very much Sleep It's something we spend about a third of our lives doing but do any of us really understand what it's all about Two thousand years ago Galen one of the most prominent medical researchers of the ancient world proposed that while we're awake our brain's motive force its juice would flow out to all the other parts of the body animating them but leaving the brain all dried up and he thought that when we sleep all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back rehydrating the brain and refreshing the mind Now that sounds completely ridiculous to us now but Galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that we all deal with every day See we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep it clears your mind and when you don't sleep it leaves your mind murky But while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when Galen was around we still haven't understood why it is that sleep of all of our activities has this incredible restorative function for the mind So today I want to tell you about some recent research that may shed new light on this question We've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution to some of the brain's most basic needs a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body So almost all the biology that we observe can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body In the brain that is especially critical; its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body's entire energy supply even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body's mass So the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body You can actually see it in this video here Here we're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse The blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume They start at the surface of the brain and then they dive down into the tissue itself and as they spread out they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain Now just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it every cell also produces waste as a byproduct and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system which has evolved to meet this need It's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body It takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells it collects them and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of But if you look really closely at this diagram you'll see something that doesn't make a lot of sense So if we were to zoom into this guy's head one of the things that you would see there is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain But that doesn't make a lot of sense does it I mean the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared And yet it lacks lymphatic vessels which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste won't work in the brain So how then does the brain solve its waste clearance problem Well that seemingly mundane question is where our group first jumped into this story and what we found as we dove down into the brain down among the neurons and the blood vessels was that the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance it was really unexpected It was ingenious but it was also beautiful Let me tell you about what we found So the brain has this large pool of clean clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid We call it the CSF The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain and wastes from inside the brain make their way out to the CSF which gets dumped along with the waste into the blood So in that way it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system doesn't it But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain they don't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of CSF Instead there is a specialized network of plumbing that organizes and facilitates this process You can see that in these videos Here we're again imaging into the brain of living mice The frame on your left shows what's happening at the brain's surface and the frame on your right shows what's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself We've labeled the blood vessels in red and the CSF that's surrounding the brain will be in green Now what was surprising to us was that the fluid on the outside of the brain it didn't stay on the outside Instead the CSF was pumped back into and through the brain along the outsides of the blood vessels and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels it was actually helping to clear away to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain's cells If you think about it using the outsides of these blood vessels like this is a really clever design solution because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it's packed full of cells so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system Yet the blood vessels they extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain which means that fluid that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume so it's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels the blood vessels to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels the lymphatic vessels to make it so you don't need them And what's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain But our most surprising finding was that all of this everything I just told you about with all this fluid rushing through the brain it's only happening in the sleeping brain Here the video on the left shows how much of the CSF is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake It's almost nothing Yet in the same animal if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep what we see is that the CSF is rushing through the brain and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep the brain cells themselves seem to shrink opening up spaces in between them allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out So it seems that Galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on Our own research now it's 2，000 years later suggests that what's happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later and then when it goes to sleep and doesn't have to be as busy it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its cells the waste that's accumulated throughout the day So it's actually a little bit like how you or I we put off our household chores during the work week when we don't have time to get to it and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around Now I've just talked a lot about waste clearance but I haven't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy The waste product that these recent studies focused most on is amyloid-beta My brain's making amyloid-beta right now and so is yours But in patients with Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain's cells instead of being cleared away like it's supposed to be and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta that's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared from the brain when it's awake versus when it's asleep and we found that indeed the clearance of amyloid-beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain So if sleep then is part of the brain's solution to the problem of waste clearance then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep amyloid-beta and Alzheimer's disease A series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid-beta building up in the brain and while it's important to point out that these studies don't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause Alzheimer's disease to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta may contribute to the development of conditions like Alzheimer's So what this new research tells us then is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep that even Galen understood about sleep that it refreshes and clears the mind may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about See you and I we go to sleep every single night but our brains they never rest While our body is still and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work this unimaginably complex machine Like our housework it's a dirty and a thankless job but it's also important for a month your home will become completely unlivable very quickly But in the brain the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty countertops because when it comes to cleaning the brain it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that's at stake which is why understanding these may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow Thank you There is an entire genre of YouTube videos devoted to an experience which It entails an individual who thinking they're alone some mild sexual activity only to discover that in fact they are not alone the discovery of which causes them to immediately cease what they were doing in horror The sense of shame and humiliation in their face is palpable It's the sense of This is the crux of the work on which I have been singularly focused for the last 16 months the question of why privacy matters a question that has arisen in the context of a global debate enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden that the United States and its partners unbeknownst to the entire world has converted the Internet once heralded as an unprecedented tool of liberation and democratization into an unprecedented zone of mass indiscriminate surveillance There is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance which says that there is no real harm that comes from this large-scale invasion and to care about their privacy This worldview is implicitly grounded good people and bad people Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks or who engage in violent criminality and therefore have reasons to want to hide what they're doing But by contrast good people or to plan their kids' Little League games and those people are doing nothing wrong and therefore have nothing to hide and no reason to fear the government monitoring them The people who are actually saying that are engaged in a very extreme act of self-deprecation I have agreed to make myself such a harmless and unthreatening This mindset has found what I think is its purest expression in a 2009 interview with the longtime CEO of Google Eric Schmidt who is causing invasions of privacy said this: He said If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know Now there's all kinds of things to say about that mentality who say that privacy isn't really important they don't actually believe it and the way you know that they don't actually believe it with their actions they take all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy They put passwords on their email and their social media accounts they put locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors all steps designed to prevent other people from entering what they consider their private realm The very same Eric Schmidt the CEO of Google Internet magazine CNET about Eric Schmidt which it obtained exclusively through Google searches and using other Google products with the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg pronounced that privacy is no longer a social norm Last year Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife purchased not only their own house but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto for a total of 30 million dollars that prevented other people from monitoring what they do in their personal lives Over the last 16 months as I've debated this issue around the world every single time somebody has said to me I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide I always say the same thing to them I get out a pen I write down my email address I say Here's my email address What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts but all of them because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online After all if you're not a bad person if you're doing nothing wrong you should have nothing to hide I check and I check that email account religiously all the time It's a very desolate place And there's a reason for that even those of us who in words instinctively understand the profound importance of it It is true that as human beings we're social animals which means we have a need for other people to know what we're doing and saying and thinking But equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go There's a reason why we seek that out and our reason is that all of us not just terrorists and criminals all of us have things to hide There are all sorts of things that we do and think or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse or our best friend that we would be mortified for the rest of the world to learn We make judgments every single day that we're willing to have other people know that we don't want anyone else to know about People can very easily in words claim that they don't value their privacy but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief Now there's a reason why privacy is so craved universally and instinctively It isn't just a reflexive movement like breathing air or drinking water The reason is that when we're in a state where we can be monitored where we can be watched our behavior changes dramatically The range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we're being watched severely reduce This is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion There are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant as is the desire to avoid it and that's the reason why people but that are about the expectations that others have of them or the mandates of societal orthodoxy This realization was exploited most powerfully who set out to resolve an important problem ushered in by the industrial age where for the first time institutions had become so large and centralized that they were no longer able to monitor and therefore control each one of their individual members and the solution that he devised was an architectural design originally intended to be implemented in prisons that he called the panopticon the primary attribute of which was the construction of an enormous tower in the center of the institution where whoever controlled the institution could at any moment watch any of the inmates And crucial to this design was that the inmates could not actually see into the panopticon into the tower and so they never knew if they were being watched or even when And what made him so excited about this discovery at any given moment which would be the ultimate enforcer for obedience and compliance The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault realized that that model could be used that seeks to control human behavior: schools hospitals factories workplaces And what he said was that this mindset this framework discovered by Bentham was the key means of societal control for modern Western societies which no longer need the overt weapons of tyranny punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party because mass surveillance creates a prison in the mind that is a much more subtle though much more effective means of fostering compliance with social norms or with social orthodoxy much more effective The most iconic work of literature about surveillance and privacy is the George Orwell novel 1984 which we all learn in school and therefore it's almost become a cliche In fact whenever you bring it up in a debate about surveillance people instantaneously dismiss it as inapplicable and what they say is Oh well in '1984，' there were monitors in people's homes they were being watched at every given moment and that has nothing to do with the surveillance state that we face of the warnings that Orwell issued in 1984 The warning that he was issuing was about a surveillance state be monitored at any given moment Here is how Orwell's narrator Winston Smith described the surveillance system that they faced: There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment He went on to say At any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to You had to live did live from habit that became instinct every movement scrutinized The Abrahamic religions similarly posit that there's an invisible all-knowing authority who because of its omniscience always watches whatever you're doing the ultimate enforcer for obedience to its dictates What all of these seemingly disparate works is that a society in which people can be monitored at all times is a society that breeds conformity and obedience and submission craves that system Conversely even more importantly it is a realm of privacy the ability to go somewhere where we can think and reason and interact and speak without the judgmental eyes of others being cast upon us in which creativity and exploration and dissent exclusively reside when we allow a society to exist in which we're subject to constant monitoring we allow the essence of human freedom to be severely crippled the idea that only people who are doing something wrong have things to hide and therefore reasons to care about privacy is that it entrenches two very destructive messages two destructive lessons the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy the only people who will seek out privacy are by definition bad people This is a conclusion that we should have all kinds of reasons for avoiding somebody who is doing bad things or engaging in violent criminality a much narrower conception when they say doing bad things For them doing bad things typically means doing something that poses meaningful challenges to the exercise of our own power The other really destructive and I think even more insidious lesson that comes from accepting this mindset is there's an implicit bargain that people who accept this mindset have accepted and that bargain is this: If you're willing to render yourself sufficiently harmless sufficiently unthreatening to those who wield political power then and only then can you be free of the dangers of surveillance It's only those who are dissidents who challenge power who have something to worry about Even if you're somebody who decides that you never want to the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve Equally critical is that the measure of how free a society is but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways It renders off-limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it's happened The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg once said He who does not move does not notice his chains We can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable Thank you very much Thank you Thank you Glenn thank you The case is rather convincing I have to say but I want to bring you back to the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden for a few questions if you don't mind The first one is personal to you We have all read about the arrest of your partner David Miranda in London and other difficulties but I assume that in terms of personal engagement and risk that the pressure on you is not that easy Tell us a little bit about that Glenn Greenwald: You know I think one of the things that happens is that people's courage in this regard gets contagious were certainly aware of the risk disclose thousands of their secrets on the Internet at will seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old ordinary person who grew up in a very ordinary environment exercise the degree of principled courage that Edward Snowden risked knowing that he was going to go to prison for the rest of his life inspired me and inspired other journalists including future whistleblowers I'm curious about your relationship with Ed Snowden because you have spoken with him a lot and you certainly continue doing so but in your book you never call him Edward nor Ed you say Snowden How come GG: You know I'm sure that's something for a team of psychologists to examine one of the important objectives that he actually had one of his I think most important tactics was that he knew that one of the ways to distract attention from the substance of the revelations would be to try and personalize the focus on him He tried not to ever have his personal life subject to examination and so I think calling him Snowden rather than trying to personalize him in a way that might distract attention from the substance Moderator: So his revelations your analysis the work of other journalists have really developed the debate and many governments for example have reacted including in Brazil with projects and programs to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet etc There are a lot of things going on in that sense But I'm wondering for you personally what is the endgame At what point will you think well actually we've succeeded in moving the dial GG: Well I mean the endgame for me as a journalist is very simple which is to make sure that every single document that's newsworthy and that ought to be disclosed ends up being disclosed end up uncovered To me that's the essence of journalism As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more I mean I look at this as work that will never end until governments around the world are no longer able to subject entire populations to monitoring and surveillance unless they convince some court or some entity that the person they've targeted has actually done something wrong To me that's the way that privacy can be rejuvenated So Snowden is very as we've seen at TED is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself as a defender of democratic values and democratic principles They find it difficult to believe that there was no money involved even to China and to Russia which are clearly not the best friends of the United States right now are wondering the same question GG: No I consider that absurd and idiotic If you wanted to but if you wanted to sell secrets to another country which he could have done and become extremely rich doing so the last thing you would do is take those secrets because it makes those secrets worthless People who want to enrich themselves do it secretly by selling secrets to the government but I think there's one important point worth making which is that accusation comes from people in the U。S government from people in the media who are loyalists to these various governments and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people Oh he can't really be doing this for principled reasons he must have some corrupt nefarious reason they're saying a lot more about themselves than they are the target of their accusations because they themselves never act for any reason other than corrupt reasons so they assume that everybody else is plagued by the same disease of soullessness as they are and so that's the assumption Glenn thank you very much GG: Thank you very much Glenn Greenwald I live in Washington D。C。 but I grew up in Sindhekela a village in Orissa in India My father was a government worker My mother could not read or write but she would say to me A king is worshipped only in his own kingdom A poet is respected everywhere So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up But I almost didn't go to college until an aunt offered financial help I went to study in Sambalpur the largest town in the region where already in college I saw a television for the first time I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies When the opportunity came I crossed two oceans with borrowed money for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket In the U。S。 I worked in a research center part-time while taking graduate classes in economics And with the little I earned I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father My story is not unique There are millions of people who migrate each year With the help of the family they cross oceans they cross deserts they cross rivers they cross mountains They risk their lives to realize a dream and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family which has helped them before There are 232 million international migrants in the world These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth only international migrants that would be larger in population That would be larger in its size of the economy than France Some 180 million of them from poor countries send money home regularly Those sums of money are called remittances Here is a fact that might surprise you: 413 billion dollars 413 billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries Migrants from developing countries 413 billion dollars That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money And yet you and I my colleagues in Washington we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid while we ignore remittances as small change True people send 200 dollars per month on average But repeated month after month by millions of people these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency So India last year received 72 billion dollars larger than its IT exports In Egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the Suez Canal In Tajikistan remittances are 42 percent of GDP And in poorer countries smaller countries fragile countries conflict-afflicted countries remittances are a lifeline as in Somalia or in Haiti No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people Remittances unlike private investment money they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country They actually act like an insurance When the family is in trouble facing hardship facing hard times remittances increase they act like an insurance Migrants send more money then Unlike development aid money that must go through official agencies through governments remittances directly reach the poor reach the family and often with business advice So in Nepal the share of poor people was 42 percent in 1995 the share of poor people in the population By 2005 a decade later at a time of political crisis economic crisis the share of poor people went down to 31 percent That decline in poverty most of it about half of it is believed to be another poor country In El Salvador the school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances In Mexico and Sri Lanka the birth weight of children is higher among families that receive remittances Remittances are dollars wrapped with care Migrants send money home for food for buying necessities for building houses healthcare for the elderly for business investments for friends and family Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery or a wedding And migrants also send money perhaps far too many times they cannot attend Much as these flows do all that good flows of remittances these 400 billion dollars of remittances Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home Money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor They will say Up to 500 dollars 30 dollars fixed If you are poor and if you have only 200 dollars to send you have to pay that $30 fee money is eight percent That means you send 100 dollars the family on the other side receives only 92 dollars the cost is even higher: 12 percent To send money within Africa the cost is even higher: over 20 percent For example sending money from Benin to Nigeria And then there is the case of Venezuela where because of exchange controls you send 100 dollars and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even 10 dollars Of course nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel It all goes in suitcases Whereever costs are high money goes underground And what is worse many developing countries actually out of the country Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific countries So is it that there are no options no better options cheaper options to send money There are M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only 60 cents per transaction U。S Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction And yet these faster cheaper better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering even though there is little data to support any connection any significant connection between money laundering and these small remittance transactions Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses especially those serving Somalia Somalia a country where the per capita income is only 250 dollars per year Monthly remittances on average to Somalia is larger than that amount Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia And yet this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood to that economy through regulations Then there is the case of poor people from villages like me In the villages the only place where you can get money is through the post office Most of the governments in the world have allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies So if I have to send money to my father in the village I must send money through that particular money transfer company even if the cost is high I cannot go to a cheaper option This has to go So what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home First relax regulations on small remittances under 1，000 dollars Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering Second governments should abolish exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money transfer company For that matter between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor In fact they should promote competition open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did like they did in the telecommunications industry You have seen what has happened there Third large nonprofit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis They should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies so that they can send money at a low cost while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to one percent from the current eight percent If we reduce costs to one percent that would release a saving of 30 billion dollars per year Thirty billion dollars that's larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year That is larger than or almost similar to the total aid budget of the United States government the largest donor on the planet Actually the savings would be larger than that 30 billion because remittance channels are also used for aid trade and investment purposes Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment pay to laborers who found them the job I was in Dubai a few years ago I visited a camp for workers It was 8 in the evening dark hot humid Workers were coming back from their grueling day of work and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker money home he has been sending money home for a few months now and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent to the labor agent who found him that job And in my mind I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance The remittance arrives She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent while the children are looking on This has to stop It is not only construction workers from Bangladesh it is all the workers There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem A construction worker from Bangladesh on an average pays about 4，000 dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only 2，000 dollars per year in income That means that for the two years or three years of his life he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees The family doesn't get to see any of it It is not only Dubai it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers it is workers from all over the world It is not only men Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize through innovation diaspora saving and diaspora giving Migrants send money home but they also save a large amount of money where they live Annually migrant savings are estimated to be 500 billion dollars Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate or four percent interest rate and then say that the money would be used for building schools roads airports train systems in the country of origin a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to migrants on a monthly basis to send remittances that's when you can actually sell it to them You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving bullet train system in India and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most Remittances empower people We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper And it can be done As for myself I have been away from India for two decades now My wife is a Venezuelan My children are Americans Increasingly I feel like a global citizen And yet I am growing nostalgic about my country of birth I want to be in India and in the U。S at the same time My parents are not there anymore My brothers and sisters have moved on There is no real urgency for me to send money home And yet from time to time I send money home to friends to relatives to the village to be there to stay engaged that's part of my identity And I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants of the cycle of poverty Thank you I have the feeling that we can all agree that we're moving towards a new model of the state and society But we're absolutely clueless as to what this is or what it should be It seems like we need to have a conversation about democracy in our day and age Let's think about it this way: We are 21st-century citizens doing our very very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions that are based on an information technology of the 15th century Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system First of all it's designed for an information technology that's over 500 years old And the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many And the many get to vote once every couple of years In the second place the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high You either have to have a fair bit of money and influence or you have to devote your entire life to politics You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe one day you'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made And last but not least the language of the system it's incredibly cryptic It's done for lawyers by lawyers and no one else can understand So it's a system where we can choose our authorities but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their decisions So in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can more than ever before express our desires and our concerns Our political system remains the same for the past 200 years and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients of a monologue So it's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results: silence or noise Silence in terms of citizens not engaging simply not wanting to participate There's this commonplace idea that I truly truly dislike and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic That we shun commitment But can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever Conflict is bound to happen between a system and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves And then we find noise: Chile Argentina Brazil Mexico Italy France Spain the United States they're all democracies Their citizens have access to the ballot boxes But they still feel the need they need to take to the streets in order to be heard To me it seems like the 18th-century slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies No taxation without representation can now be updated to No representation without a conversation We want our seat at the table And rightly so But in order to be part of this conversation we need to know what we want to do next because political action is being able to move from agitation to construction My generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests protests that were able to successfully impose agendas roll back extremely pernicious legislation and even overthrow authoritarian governments And we should be immensely proud of this But we also must admit that we haven't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen And so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes But our democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years But it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets So the question I'd like to raise here and I do believe it's the most important question we need to answer is this one: If Internet is the new printing press then what is democracy for the Internet era What institutions do we want to build for the 21st-century society I don't have the answer just in case I don't think anyone does But I truly believe we can't afford to ignore this question anymore So I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation Two years ago with a group of friends from Argentina we started thinking how can we get our representatives our elected representatives to represent us Marshall McLuhan once said that politics is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools So the question that motivated us was can we try and solve some of today's problems Our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called DemocracyOS DemocracyOS is an open-source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for us to participate from our everyday lives So first of all you can get informed so every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information but from doing something with it So better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we're going to do next and DemocracyOS allows for that Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other but that our healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values So DemocracyOS is about persuading and being persuaded It's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement And finally you can vote how you would like your elected representative to vote And if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue you can always delegate your vote to someone else allowing for a dynamic and emerging social leadership It suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress But it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick What we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it to make better and more fair decisions We said Look here you have a platform that you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies And yes we failed We failed big time We were sent to play outside like little kids Amongst other things we were called naive And I must be honest: I think in hindsight we were Because the challenges that we face they're not technological they're cultural Political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions So it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea we needed to do it ourselves And so we took quite a leap of faith our own political party El Partido de la Red or the Net Party in the city of Buenos Aires And taking an even bigger leap of faith we ran for elections in October last year with this idea: if we want a seat in Congress our candidate our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on DemocracyOS Every single project that got introduced in Congress we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform It was our way of hacking the political system We understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation to have a seat at the table we needed to become valid stakeholders and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules But we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions For the first time we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions It was a very very bold move for a two-month-old party in the city of Buenos Aires But it got attention We got 22，000 votes that's 1。2 percent of the votes and we came in second for the local options So even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress it was enough for us to become part of the conversation to the extent that next month Congress as an institution is launching for the first time in Argentina's history a DemocracyOS to discuss with the citizens three pieces of legislation: two on urban transportation and one on the use of public space Of course our elected representatives are not saying Yes we're going to vote according to what citizens decide but they're willing to try They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they'll be willing to listen as well Our political system can be transformed and not by subverting it by destroying it but by rewiring it with the tools that Internet affords us now But a real challenge is to find to design to create to empower those connectors that are able to innovate to transform noise and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies to the 21st century I'm not saying it's easy But in our experience we actually stand a chance of making it work And in my heart it's most definitely worth trying Thank you It's very nice to be here tonight So I've been working on the history of income and wealth distribution for the past 15 years and one of the interesting lessons coming from this historical evidence is indeed that in the long run there is a tendency for the rate of return of capital to exceed the economy's growth rate and this tends to lead to high concentration of wealth Not infinite concentration of wealth the higher the level of inequality of wealth towards which society tends to converge So this is a key force that I'm going to talk about today but let me say right away that this is not the only important force in the dynamics of income and wealth distribution and there are many other forces that play an important role in the long-run dynamics of income and wealth distribution Also there is a lot of data that still needs to be collected We know a little bit more today than we used to know but we still know too little and certainly there are many different processes economic social political that need to be studied more And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force but that doesn't mean that other important forces do not exist So most of the data I'm going to present comes from this database that's available online: the World Top Incomes Database So this is the largest existing historical database on inequality and this comes from the effort of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries coming from this database and then we'll return to r bigger than g So fact number one is that there has been a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality between the United States and Europe over the past century So back in 1900 1910 income inequality was actually much higher in Europe than in the United States whereas today it is a lot higher in the United States So let me be very clear: The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g It has more to do with changing supply and demand for skill the race between education and technology globalization probably more unequal access to skills in the U。S。 where you have very good very top universities but where the bottom part of the educational system is not as good so very unequal access to skills and also an unprecedented rise of top managerial compensation of the United States which is difficult to account for just on the basis of education So there is more going on here but I'm not going to talk too much about this today because I want to focus on wealth inequality So let me just show you a very simple indicator about the income inequality part So this is the share of total income going to the top 10 percent So you can see that one century ago it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe and a little bit above 40 percent in the U。S。 so there was more inequality in Europe Then there was a sharp decline during the first half of the 20th century and in the recent decade you can see that the U。S has become more unequal than Europe and this is the first fact I just talked about Now the second fact is more about wealth inequality and here the central fact is that wealth inequality is always a lot higher than income inequality and also that wealth inequality although it has also increased in recent decades is still less extreme today than what it was a century ago although the total quantity of wealth relative to income has now recovered from the very large shocks caused by World War I the Great Depression World War II So let me show you two graphs illustrating fact number two and fact number three So first if you look at the level of wealth inequality this is the share of total wealth going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders so you can see the same kind of reversal between the U。S and Europe that we had before for income inequality So wealth concentration was higher in Europe than in the U。S a century ago and now it is the opposite But you can also show two things: First the general level of wealth inequality is always higher than income inequality So remember for income inequality the share going to the top 10 percent was between 30 and 50 percent of total income whereas for wealth the share is always between 60 and 90 percent Okay so that's fact number one and that's very important for what follows Wealth concentration is always a lot higher than income concentration Fact number two is that the rise in wealth inequality in recent decades is still not enough to get us back to 1910 So the big difference today wealth inequality is still very large with 60 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10 but the good news is that it's actually better than one century ago where you had 90 percent in Europe going to the top 10 So today what you have is what I call the middle 40 percent the people who are not in the top 10 and who are not in the bottom 50 and what you can view as the wealth middle class that owns 20 to 30 percent whereas they used to be poor a century ago when there was basically no wealth middle class So this is an important change and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels although the total quantity of wealth has recovered Okay So this is the total value of wealth relative to income and you can see that in particular in Europe we are almost back to the pre-World War I level So there are really two different parts of the story here One has to do with the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate and there is nothing bad per se of course in accumulating a lot of wealth and in particular if it is more diffuse and less concentrated So what we really want to focus on is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality and what's going to happen in the future How can we account for the fact that until World War I wealth inequality was so high and if anything was rising to even higher levels and how can we think about the future So let me come to some of the explanations and speculations about the future Let me first say that probably the best model to explain why wealth is so much more concentrated than income is a dynamic dynastic model where individuals have a long horizon and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons If people were accumulating wealth only for life cycle reasons you know to be able to consume when they are old then the level of wealth inequality should be more or less in line with the level of income inequality But it will be very difficult to explain why you have so much more wealth inequality than income inequality with a pure life cycle model so you need a story where people also care about wealth accumulation for other reasons So typically they want to transmit wealth to the next generation to their children or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth because of the prestige the power that goes with wealth So there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the data Now in a large class of dynamic models of wealth accumulation with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth you will have all sorts of random multiplicative shocks So for instance some families have a very large number of children so the wealth will be divided Some families have fewer children You also have shocks to rates of return Some families make huge capital gains Some made bad investments So you will always have some mobility in the wealth process Some people will move up some people will move down The important point is that in any such model for a given variance of such shocks the equilibrium level of wealth inequality will be a steeply rising function of r minus g And intuitively the reason why the difference between the rate of return to wealth and the growth rate is important is that initial wealth inequalities will be amplified at a faster pace with a bigger r minus g So take a simple example with r equals five percent and g equals one percent wealth holders only need to reinvest one fifth of their capital income to ensure that their wealth rises as fast as the size of the economy So this makes it easier to build and perpetuate large fortunes because you can consume four fifths assuming zero tax and you can just reinvest one fifth So of course some families will consume more than that some will consume less so there will be some mobility in the distribution but on average they only need to reinvest one fifth so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained Now you should not be surprised by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever because in fact this is what happened during most of the history of mankind And this was in a way very obvious to everybody for a simple reason which is that growth was close to zero percent during most of the history of mankind Growth was maybe 0。1 0。2 0。3 percent but very slow growth of population and output per capita whereas the rate of return on capital of course was not zero percent It was for land assets which was the traditional form of assets in preindustrial societies it was typically five percent Any reader of Jane Austen would know that If you want an annual income of 1，000 pounds you should have a capital value of 20，000 pounds so that five percent of 20，000 is 1，000 And in a way this was the very foundation of society because r bigger than g to live off their capital income and to do something else in life than just to care about their own survival Now one important conclusion of my historical research is that modern industrial growth did not change this basic fact as much as one might have expected Of course the growth rate following the Industrial Revolution rose typically from zero to one to two percent but at the same time the rate of return to capital also rose so that the gap between the two did not really change So during the 20th century you had a very unique combination of events First a very low rate of return due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks destruction of wealth inflation bankruptcy during the Great Depression and all of this reduced the private rate of return to wealth to unusually low levels between 1914 and 1945 And then in the postwar period you had unusually high growth rate partly due to the reconstruction You know in Germany in France in Japan you had five percent growth rate between 1950 and 1980 largely due to reconstruction and also due to very large demographic growth the Baby Boom Cohort effect Now apparently that's not going to last for very long or at least the population growth is supposed to decline in the future and the best projections we have is that the long-run growth is going to be closer to one to two percent rather than four to five percent So if you look at this these are the best estimates we have of world GDP growth and rate of return on capital average rates of return on capital so you can see that during most of the history of mankind the growth rate was very small much lower than the rate of return and then during the 20th century it is really the population growth very high in the postwar period and the reconstruction process that brought growth to a smaller gap with the rate of return Here I use the United Nations population projections so of course they are uncertain It could be that we all start having a lot of children in the future and the growth rates are going to be higher but from now on these are the best projections we have and this will make global growth decline and the gap between the rate of return go up Now the other unusual event during the 20th century was as I said destruction taxation of capital so this is the pre-tax rate of return This is the after-tax rate of return and after destruction and this is what brought the average rate of return after tax after destruction below the growth rate during a long time period But without the destruction without the taxation this would not have happened So let me say that the balance between returns on capital and growth depends on many different factors that are very difficult to predict: technology and the development of capital-intensive techniques So right now the most capital-intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector housing the energy sector but it could be in the future that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors and that this would be a bigger share of the total capital stock that it is today Well we are very far from this and from now what's going on in the real estate sector the energy sector is much more important for the total capital stock and capital share The other important issue is that there are scale effects in portfolio management together with financial complexity financial deregulation that make it easier to get higher rates of return for a large portfolio and this seems to be particularly strong for billionaires large capital endowments Just to give you one example this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings over the 1987-2013 period and you can see the very top wealth holders have been going up at six seven percent per year in real terms above inflation whereas average income in the world average wealth in the world have increased at only two percent per year And you find the same for large university endowments the bigger the initial endowments the bigger the rate of return Now what could be done The first thing is that I think we need more financial transparency We know too little about global wealth dynamics so we need international transmission of bank information We need a global registry of financial assets more coordination on wealth taxation and even wealth tax with a small tax rate will be a way to produce information so that then we can adapt our policies to whatever we observe And to some extent the fight against tax havens and automatic transmission of information is pushing us in this direction Now there are other ways to redistribute wealth which it can be tempting to use Inflation: it's much easier to print money than to write a tax code so that's very tempting but sometimes you don't know what you do with the money This is a problem Expropriation is very tempting Just when you feel some people get too wealthy you just expropriate them But this is not a very efficient way to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics So war is an even less efficient way so I tend to prefer progressive taxation but of course history history will invent its own best ways and it will probably involve a combination of all of these Thank you Thomas Piketty Thank you Thomas I want to ask you two or three questions because it's impressive how you're in command of your data of course but basically what you suggest is growing wealth concentration is kind of a natural tendency of capitalism and if we leave it to its own devices it may threaten the system itself so you're suggesting that we need to act to implement policies that redistribute wealth including the ones we just saw: progressive taxation etc In the current political context how realistic are those How likely do you think that it is that they will be implemented Thomas Piketty: Well you know I think if you look back through time the history of income wealth and taxation is full of surprise So I am not terribly impressed by those who know in advance what will or will not happen I think one century ago many people would have said that progressive income taxation would never happen and then it happened And even five years ago many people would have said that bank secrecy will be with us forever in Switzerland that Switzerland was too powerful for the rest of the world and then suddenly it took a few U。S sanctions against Swiss banks for a big change to happen and now we are moving toward more financial transparency So I think it's not that difficult to better coordinate politically We are going to have a treaty with half of the world GDP around the table with the U。S and the European Union so if half of the world GDP is not enough to make progress on financial transparency and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits what does it take So I think these are not technical difficulties I think we can make progress if we have a more pragmatic approach to these questions and we have the proper sanctions on those who benefit from financial opacity One of the arguments against your point of view is that economic inequality is not only a feature of capitalism but is actually one of its engines So we take measures to lower inequality and at the same time we lower growth potentially What do you answer to that TP: Yeah I think inequality is not a problem per se I think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth The problem is it's a question of degree When inequality gets too extreme then it becomes useless for growth and it can even become bad because it tends to lead to high perpetuation of inequality over time and low mobility And for instance the kind of wealth concentrations that we had in the 19th century and pretty much until World War I in every European country was I think not useful for growth This was destroyed by a combination of tragic events and policy changes and this did not prevent growth from happening And also extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice and the influence of private money in U。S politics I think is a matter of concern right now So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme pre-World War I inequality Having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth It is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons I said at the beginning that your book has been criticized Some of your data has been criticized Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized You have been accused of cherry-picking data to make your case What do you answer to that TP: Well I answer that I am very happy that this book is stimulating debate This is part of what it is intended for Look the reason why I put all the data online with all of the detailed computation is so that we can have an open and transparent debate about this So I have responded point by point to every concern Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today I would actually conclude that the rise in wealth inequality particularly in the United States has been actually higher than what I report in my book There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman showing with new data which I didn't have at the time of the book that wealth concentration in the U。S has risen even more than what I report And there will be other data in the future Some of it will go in different directions Look we put online almost every week and we will keep doing so in the future in particular in emerging countries to this data collection process In fact I certainly agree that there is not enough transparency about wealth dynamics and a good way to have better data would be to have a wealth tax with a small tax rate to begin with so that we can all agree about this important evolution and adapt our policies to whatever we observe So taxation is a source of knowledge and that's what we need the most right now Thomas Piketty merci beaucoup Thank you TP: Thank you Recently I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George Frideric Handel I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam again playing music by this same composer Let's take a look Daria van den Bercken: I live there on the third floor I live there on the corner I actually live there around the corner and you'd be really welcome Does that sound like fun Yes Handel house concert Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real Now you may ask why have I done these things They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life Well I did it because I fell in love with the music as possible It started a couple of years ago I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard Well I was surprised I did not know this So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing And what happened next was that I entered this state of pure and I had not felt that in a long time It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it started like this Well this sounds very melancholic doesn't it And I turned the page and what came next was this Well this sounds very energetic doesn't it So within a couple of minutes and the piece isn't even finished yet I experienced two very contrasting characters: beautiful melancholy and sheer energy vital human expressions very effectively for children of seven and eight years old and whatever I play whether it's Bach Beethoven even Stockhausen or some jazzy music they are open to hear it really willing to listen 11 12 I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that The complexity of the music does become an issue parents friends media they start to count But the young ones they don't question their own opinion They are in this constant state of wonder and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children even when growing up And that is why I have played but also on the street online in the air: to truly listen and to listen without prejudice And I would like to invite you to do so now Thank you Today I want to tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world to paint a neural portrait of the human mind And the central idea of this work is that the human mind and brain is not a single general-purpose processor but a collection of highly specialized components each solving a different specific problem and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers To give you a feel for this idea imagine the following scenario: You walk into your child's day care center As usual there's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up but this time the children's faces look weirdly similar and you can't figure out which child is yours Do you need new glasses Are you losing your mind You run through a quick mental checklist No you seem to be thinking clearly and your vision is perfectly sharp And everything looks normal except the children's faces You can see the faces but they don't look distinctive and none of them looks familiar and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people It's called prosopagnosia and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain The striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired; everything else is just fine Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage These syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology especially MRI So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution so I'm going to show you in a second a set of MRI cross-sectional images through a familiar object and we're going to fly through them and you're going to try to figure out what the object is Here we go It's not that easy It's an artichoke Okay let's try another one starting from the bottom and going through the top Broccoli It's a head of broccoli Isn't it beautiful I love that Okay here's another one It's a brain of course We're going through slices through my head like that That's my nose over on the right and now we're going over here right there So this picture's nice if I do say so myself but it shows only anatomy The really cool advance with functional imaging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but activity that is where neurons are firing So here's how this works Brains are like muscles When they get active they need increased blood flow to supply that activity and lucky for us blood flow control to the brain is local so if a bunch of neurons say right there get active and start firing then blood flow increases just right there So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase producing a higher MRI response where neural activity goes up So to give you a concrete feel for how a functional MRI experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can't let me describe one of the first studies I ever did We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that I described a moment ago but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person so we set out to look for it So I was the first subject I went into the scanner I lay on my back I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control When I got out of the scanner I did a quick analysis of the data looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects and here's what I saw Now this image looks just awful by today's standards but at the time I thought it was beautiful What it shows is that region right there that little blob it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there And what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher MRI response that is higher neural activity when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects So that's pretty cool but how do we know this isn't a fluke Well the easiest way is to just do the experiment again So I got back in the scanner I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob and then I did it again and I did it again and again and again and around about then I decided to believe it was for real But still maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there so to find out we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain So the next question was what does this thing really do Is it really specialized just for face recognition Well maybe not right Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round The only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition is to rule out all of those hypotheses So we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn't a face like some of these So have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition No we haven't Brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything All you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function you need to mess with it and see what happens and normally we don't get to do that But an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here in his hospital bed where he's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures So it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area So with the patient's consent the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain Now the patient doesn't know where those electrodes are and he's never heard of the face area So let's watch what happens It's going to start with a control condition that will say Sham nearly invisibly in red in the lower left when no current is delivered and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first So let's watch Neurologist: Okay just look at my face and tell me what happens when I do this All right Patient: Okay Neurologist: One two three Patient: Nothing Neurologist: Nothing Okay I'm going to do it one more time Look at my face One two three Patient: You just turned into somebody else Your face metamorphosed Your nose got saggy it went to the left You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before but somebody different That was a trip Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception So I went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process Next I'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found So to do this I've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the last month so I can show you these things in my brain So let's get started Here's my right hemisphere So we're oriented like that You're looking at my head this way Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that Okay now as you can see the surface of the brain is all folded up So that's not good Stuff could be hidden in there We want to see the whole thing so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing Next let's find that face area I've been talking about that responds to images like these To see that let's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom and there it is that's my face area Just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places like right now I'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active There's another one out on the outside surface again where there's a couple more face regions as well Also in this vicinity is a region that's selectively involved in processing visual motion like these moving dots here and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these and that region is shown in lime green at the bottom of the brain Now all these regions I've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception Do we also have specialized brain regions for other senses like hearing Yes we do So if we turn the brain around a little bit here's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago and this region responds strongly when you hear sounds with pitch like these In contrast that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don't have a clear pitch like these Okay Next to the pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech Okay now let's look at these same regions In my left hemisphere there's a similar arrangement not identical but similar and most of the same regions are in here albeit sometimes different in size Now everything I've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception vision and hearing Do we also have specialized brain regions for really fancy complicated mental processes Yes we do So here in pink are my language regions So it's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence but not when you do other complex mental things like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music The most amazing region that's been found yet is this one right here in turquoise This region responds when you think about what another person is thinking So that may seem crazy but actually we humans do this all the time You're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don't call home to say you're running late I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray uncharted territory in the brain and what's up with that Well I'm wondering about that too and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions But importantly I don't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function even mental functions that may be critical for survival In fact a few years ago there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this And further he found a similar response in more or less the same location in 10 out of 12 subjects So he was pretty stoked and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on Oprah with his big discovery But then he devised the critical test: He showed subjects images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape but that weren't food like these And his region responded the same to both sets of images So it wasn't a food area it was just a region that liked colors and shapes So much for Oprah But then the question of course is how do we process all this other stuff that we don't have specialized brain regions for Well I think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that I've been describing we also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along In fact we've shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all well of the seven that we've tested So each of the brain regions that I've described to you today is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject I could take any of you pop you in the scanner and find each of those regions in your brain and it would look a lot like my brain although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size What's important to me about this work is not the particular locations of these brain regions but the simple fact that we have selective specific components of mind and brain in the first place I mean it could have been otherwise The brain could have been a single general-purpose processor more like a kitchen knife than a Swiss Army knife Instead what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind So we have this picture of very general-purpose machinery in our heads in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components It's early days in this enterprise We've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind The most fundamental questions remain unanswered So for example what does each of these regions do exactly Why do we need three face areas and three place areas and what's the division of labor between them Second how are all these things connected in the brain With diffusion imaging you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain and with this method shown here you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain Third how does all of this very systematic structure get built both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species To address questions like that scientists are now scanning other species of animals and they're also scanning human infants Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism That's a hugely important goal and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing The effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease What could be more thrilling that underlie human experience to understand in essence who we are This is I think the greatest scientific quest of all time I want to tell you how 20，000 remarkable young people from over 100 countries ended up in Cuba and are transforming health in their communities Ninety percent of them would never have left home at all if it weren't for a scholarship to study medicine in Cuba and a commitment to go back to places like the ones they'd come from remote farmlands mountains ghettos to become doctors for people like themselves to walk the walk Havana's Latin American Medical School: It's the largest medical school in the world graduating 23，000 young doctors since its first class of 2005 with nearly 10，000 more in the pipeline Its mission to train physicians for the people who need them the most: the over one billion who have never seen a doctor the people who live and die under every poverty line ever invented Its students defy all norms They're the school's biggest risk and also its best bet They're recruited from the poorest most broken places on our planet by a school that believes they can become not just the good but the excellent physicians their communities desperately need that they will practice where most doctors don't in places not only poor but oftentimes dangerous carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks or navigating neighborhoods riddled by drugs gangs and bullets their home ground The hope is that they will help transform access to care the health picture in impoverished areas and even the way medicine itself is learned and practiced and that they will become pioneers in our global reach for universal health coverage surely a tall order Two big storms and this notion of walk the walk prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998 The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch had ripped through the Caribbean and Central America leaving 30，000 dead and two and a half million homeless Hundreds of Cuban doctors volunteered for disaster response but when they got there they found a bigger disaster: whole communities with no healthcare doors bolted shut on rural hospitals for lack of staff and just too many babies dying before their first birthday What would happen when these Cuban doctors left New doctors were needed to make care sustainable but where would they come from Where would they train In Havana the campus of a former naval academy was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry to become the Latin American Medical School ELAM Tuition room and board and a small stipend were offered to hundreds of students from the countries hardest hit by the storms As a journalist in Havana I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive in March 1999 settling into dorms barely refurbished and helping their professors not only sweep out the classrooms but move in the desks and the chairs and the microscopes Over the next few years governments throughout the Americas requested scholarships for their own students and the Congressional Black Caucus asked for and received hundreds of scholarships for young people from the USA Today among the 23，000 are graduates from 83 countries in the Americas Africa and Asia and enrollment has grown to 123 nations More than half the students are young women They come from 100 ethnic groups speak 50 different languages WHO Director Margaret Chan said For once if you are poor female or from an indigenous population you have a distinct advantage an ethic that makes this medical school unique Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho on the Atlantic coast of Honduras There's no running water no electricity there and to reach the village you have to walk for hours or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did skirting the waves of the Atlantic Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children who started grammar school the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people known as the Garífuna 20 percent of the Honduran population The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away Luther had to walk three hours every day to middle school Only 17 made that trip Only five went on to high school and only one to university: Luther to ELAM among the first crop of Garífuna graduates Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them in all of Honduran history Now there are 69 thanks to ELAM Big problems need big solutions sparked by big ideas imagination and audacity but also solutions that work ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base to guide them so they learned the hard way by doing and correcting course as they went Even the brightest students from these poor communities weren't academically prepared for six years of medical training so a bridging course was set up in sciences Then came language: these were Mapuche Quechuas Guaraní Garífuna who learned Spanish as a second language or Haitians who spoke Creole So Spanish became part of the pre-pre-med curriculum Even so in Cuba the music the food the smells just about everything was different so faculty became family ELAM home Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs to Yoruba Muslim and Christian evangelical Embracing diversity became a way of life Why have so many countries asked for these scholarships First they just don't have enough doctors and where they do their distribution is skewed against the poor because our global health crisis is fed by a crisis in human resources We are short four to seven million health workers just to meet basic needs and the problem is everywhere Doctors are concentrated in the cities where only half the world's people live and within cities not in the shantytowns or South L。A Here in the United States where we have healthcare reform we don't have the professionals we need By 2020 we will be short 45，000 primary care physicians And we're also part of the problem The United States is the number one importer of doctors from developing countries The second reasons students flock to Cuba is the island's own health report card relying on strong primary care A commission from The Lancet middle-income countries in health Save the Children ranks Cuba the best country in Latin America to become a mother Cuba has similar life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States with fewer disparities while spending per person one 20th of what we do on health here in the USA Academically ELAM is tough but 80 percent of its students graduate The subjects are familiar basic and clinical sciences but there are major differences First training has moved out of the ivory tower and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods the kinds of places most of these grads will practice Sure they have lectures and hospital rotations too but community-based learning starts on day one Second students treat the whole patient mind and body and their culture Third they learn public health: to assess their patients' drinking water housing social and economic conditions Fourth they are taught that a good patient interview and a thorough clinical exam provide most of the clues for diagnosis saving costly technology for confirmation And finally they're taught over and over again the importance of prevention especially as chronic diseases cripple health systems worldwide Such an in-service learning also comes with a team approach as much how to work in teams as how to lead them with a dose of humility Upon graduation these doctors share their knowledge with nurse's aids midwives community health workers to help them become better at what they do not to replace them to work with shamans and traditional healers ELAM's graduates: Are they proving this audacious experiment right Dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they're capable of doing Take the Garífuna grads They not only went to work back home but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital With an architect's help residents literally raised it from the ground up The first patients walked through the doors in December 2007 and since then the hospital has received nearly one million patient visits And government is paying attention upholding the hospital as a model of rural public health for Honduras ELAM's graduates are smart strong and also dedicated Haiti January 2010 The pain People buried under 30 million tons of rubble Overwhelming Three hundred forty Cuban doctors were already on the ground long term More were on their way Many more were needed At ELAM students worked round the clock to contact 2，000 graduates As a result hundreds arrived in Haiti 27 countries' worth from Mali in the Sahara to St Lucia Bolivia Chile and the USA They spoke easily to each other in Spanish and listened to their patients in Creole thanks to Haitian medical students flown in from ELAM in Cuba Many stayed for months even through the cholera epidemic Hundreds of Haitian graduates had to pick up the pieces overcome their own heartbreak and then pick up the burden of building a new public health system for Haiti Today with aid of organizations and governments from Norway to Cuba to Brazil dozens of new health centers have been built staffed and in 35 cases headed by ELAM graduates Yet the Haitian story also illustrates some of the bigger problems faced in many countries Take a look: 748 Haitian graduates by 2012 when cholera struck nearly half working in the public health sector but one quarter unemployed and 110 had left Haiti altogether So in the best case scenarios these graduates are staffing and thus strengthening public health systems where often they're the only doctors around In the worst cases there are simply not enough jobs in the public health sector where most poor people are treated not enough political will not enough resources not enough anything just too many patients with no care The grads face pressure from their families too desperate to make ends meet so when there are no public sector jobs these new MDs decamp into private practice or go abroad to send money home Worst of all in some countries medical societies influence accreditation bodies not to honor the ELAM degree fearful these grads will take their jobs or reduce their patient loads and income It's not a question of competencies Here in the USA the California Medical Board accredited the school after rigorous inspection and the new physicians are making good on Cuba's big bet passing their boards and accepted into highly respected residencies from New York to Chicago to New Mexico Two hundred strong they're coming back to the United States energized and also dissatisfied As one grad put it in Cuba We are trained to provide quality care with minimal resources so when I see all the resources we have here and you tell me that's not possible I know it's not true Not only have I seen it work I've done the work ELAM's graduates some from right here in D。C and Baltimore have come from the poorest of the poor to offer health education and a voice to their communities They've done the heavy lifting Now we need to do our part All of us entrepreneurs policymakers people need to step up We need to do much more globally to give these new doctors the opportunity to prove their mettle They need to be able to take their countries' licensing exams They need jobs in the public health sector or in nonprofit health centers to put their training and commitment to work They need the chance to be the doctors their patients need To move forward we may have to find our way back to that pediatrician who would knock on my family's door on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid who made house calls who was a public servant These aren't such new ideas of what medicine should be What's new is the scaling up and the faces of the doctors themselves: an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she than a he; In the Amazon Peru or Guatemala an indigenous doctor; in the USA a doctor of color who speaks fluent Spanish She is well trained can be counted on and shares the face and culture of her patients and she deserves our support surely because whether by subway mule or canoe she is teaching us to walk the walk Thank you Women represent 50 percent of middle management and professional positions but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of that number So some people hear that statistic and they ask why do we have so few women leaders But I look at that statistic and if you like me believe that leadership manifests at every level you would see that there's a tremendous awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management which raises a different question: Why are there so many women mired in the middle and what has to happen to take them to the top So some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization Well Tonya is a great example of one of these women I met her two years ago She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration I've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand I get terrific performance evals from my boss my 360s in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me I've taken every management course that I can here I am working with a terrific mentor and yet I've been passed over twice for advancement opportunities even when my manager knows that I'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment I don't understand why I'm being passed over So what Tonya doesn't realize is that there's a missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is that's required to close the gender gap at the top In order to move up in organizations you have to be known for your leadership skills and this would apply to any of you women or men It means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes by engaging the greatness in others Put in other language it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside And although all three of these elements of leadership are important when it comes to moving up in organizations they aren't equally important So pay attention to the green box as I move forward In seeking and identifying employees with high potential the potential to go to the top of organizations the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership These skills and competencies can be summarized as business strategic and financial acumen In other words this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going what its strategy is what financial targets it has in place and understanding your role in moving the organization forward This is that missing 33 percent of the career success equation for women not because it's missing in our capabilities or abilities but because it's missing in the advice that we're given Here's what I mean by that Five years ago I was asked to moderate a panel of executives and the topic for the evening was What do you look for in high-potential employees So think about the three elements of leadership as I summarize for you what they told me They said We look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient So which element of leadership does that relate to Personal greatness They said We look for employees who are great with our customers who empower their teams who negotiate effectively who are able to manage conflict well and are overall great communicators Which element of leadership does that equate to Engaging the greatness in others And then they pretty much stopped So I asked Well what about people who understand your business where it's going and their role in taking it there And what about people who are able to scan the external environment identify risks and opportunities make strategy or make strategic recommendations And what about people who are able to look at the financials of your business understand the story that the financials tell and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations And to a man they said That's a given So I turned to the audience of 150 women and I asked How many of you have ever been told that the door-opener for career advancement is your business strategic and financial acumen and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool Three women raised their hand and I've asked this question of women all around the globe in the five years since and the percentage is never much different So this is obvious right But how can it be Well there are primarily three reasons that there's this missing 33 percent in the career success advice given to women When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over 40 years there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business strategic and financial acumen Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take like become more assertive become more confident develop your personal brand things that Tonya's been working on and advice about working with other people things like learn to self-promote get a mentor enhance your network and virtually nothing said about the importance of business strategic and financial acumen This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle where we're 50 percent to senior and executive positions And this is why conventional advice to women in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top and won't close it Now the second reason relates to Tonya's comments about having had excellent performance evals great feedback from her teams and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on So you would think that she's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business strategic and financial acumen but here again that green square is quite small On average talent and performance management systems in the organizations that I've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business strategic and financial acumen which is why typical talent and performance systems haven't closed and won't close the gender gap at the top Now Tonya also talked about working with a mentor and this is really important to talk about because if organizations talent and performance systems aren't giving people in general information about the importance of business strategic and financial acumen how are men getting to the top Well there are primarily two ways One is because of the positions they're guided into and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship So what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring Well this comment from an executive that I worked with recently illustrates that experience He was very proud of the fact that last year he had two protégés: a man and a woman And he said I helped the woman build confidence I helped the man learn the business and I didn't realize that I was treating them any differently And he was sincere about that So what this illustrates is that as managers whether we're women or men we have mindsets about women and men about careers in leadership and these unexamined mindsets won't close the gender gap at the top So how do we take this idea of the missing 33 percent and turn it into action Well for women the answer is obvious: we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we're people who understand our businesses where they're headed and our role in taking it there That's what enables that breakthrough from middle management to leadership at the top But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this One young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing 33 percent to weave financial impact data into a project update she did and got tremendous positive feedback from the managers in the room So we don't want to put 100 percent of the responsibility on women's shoulders nor would it be wise to do so and here's why: In order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction In other words the term we use in business is we have to have strategic alignment And executives know this very well and yet only 37 percent according to a recent Conference Board report believe that they have that strategic alignment in place So for 63 percent of organizations achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable And if you think about what I've just shared that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business where it's headed and their role in taking it there it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions Why Because if they aren't seeing that it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be It's important for CEOs to also expect these proportional pools and if they hear comments like Well she doesn't have enough business experience ask the question What are we going to do about that It's important for H。R executives to make sure that the missing 33 percent is appropriately emphasized and it's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine the mindsets we hold about women and men about careers and success to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody So let me close with the latest chapter in Tonya's story Tonya emailed me two months ago and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position and during the interview they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry and she said that she was so happy to report that now she has a new position reporting directly to the chief information officer at her company So for some of you the missing 33 percent is an idea for you to put into action and I hope that for all of you you will see it as an idea worth spreading in order to help organizations be more effective to help women create careers that soar and to help close the gender gap at the top Thank you I am an engineering professor and for the past 14 years I've been teaching crap Not that I'm a bad teacher but I've been studying and teaching about human waste and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment plants and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers I've based my scientific career on using leading-edge molecular techniques DNA- and RNA-based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors and again to optimize these systems And over the years I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets and I've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world But along the way I've learned that it's not just the technical side but there's also this thing called the culture of crap So for example how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers If well I guess you know what I mean If you're a washer then you use water for anal cleansing That's the technical term And if you're a wiper then you use toilet paper or in some regions of the world where it's not available newspaper or rags or corncobs And this is not just a piece of trivia but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem And it is a big problem: There are 2。5 billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation For them there's no modern toilet And there are 1。1 billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces and again the technical term for that is open defecation but that is really simply shitting in the open And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you you're going to get sick It's going to get into your drinking water into your food into your immediate surroundings So the United Nations estimates that every year there are 1。5 million child deaths because of inadequate sanitation That's one preventable death every 20 seconds 171 every hour 4，100 every day And so to avoid open defecation municipalities and cities build infrastructure for example like pit latrines in peri-urban and rural areas For example in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines But there's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands and the problem is what happens when the pits are full This is what happens People defecate around the toilet In schools children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building and these pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied And who does the emptying You've got these workers who have to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents It's a dirty and dangerous business As you can see there's no protective equipment no protective clothing There's one worker down there I hope you can see him He's got a face mask on but no shirt And in some countries like India the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits and they're further condemned by society So you ask yourself how can we solve this and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets for these two and a half billion And the answer is it's just not possible In some of these areas there's not enough water there's no energy it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems and if you don't build it right you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world And is this really the solution Because essentially what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're using it to flush your toilet convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river and that river again is a drinking water source So we've got to rethink sanitation and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure and I'm going to argue that to do this you have to employ systems thinking We have to look at the whole sanitation chain We start with a human interface and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored transported treated and reused and not just disposal but reuse So let's start with the human user interface I say it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable And when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain then the back-end technology the collection to the reuse should not really matter and then we can apply locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions So we can open ourselves to possibilities like for example this urine-diverting toilet and there's two holes in this toilet There's the front and the back and the front collects the urine and the back collects the fecal material And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine which has 80 percent of the nitrogen and 50 percent of the phosphorus and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite which is a high-value fertilizer and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to high-value end products Or for example in some of our research you can reuse the water by treating it in on-site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands So we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants So you might be asking who's going to pay Well I'm going to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure NGOs and donor organizations they can do their best but it's not going to be enough Governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other infrastructure like bridges because we know and the WHO has done this study that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure we get something like three to 34 dollars back Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying So at North Carolina State University we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution and this is what they came up with: a simple modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit and into a collecting drum and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the pit We tested it in South Africa and it works We need to make it more robust and we're going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year And our idea is to make this a professionalized pit-emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it create profits and jobs and the hope is that as we are rethinking sanitation we are extending the life of these pits so that we don't have to resort to quick solutions that don't really make sense I believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower-status people going down and being condemned to empty pits It is our moral it is our social and our environmental obligation Thank you When in 1960 still a student I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America We traveled the country We saw public housing high-rise buildings in all major cities: New York Philadelphia And then we traveled from suburb to suburb and I came back thinking we've got to reinvent the apartment building There has to be another way of doing this We can't sustain suburbs so let's design a building which gives the qualities of a house to each unit Habitat would be all about gardens contact with nature streets instead of corridors We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy and there it is almost 50 years later It's a very desirable place to live in It's now a heritage building but it did not proliferate In 1973 I made my first trip to China It was the Cultural Revolution We traveled the country met with architects and planners This is Beijing then not a single high rise building in Beijing or Shanghai Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city There were hardly any cars Thirty years later this is Beijing today This is Hong Kong If you're wealthy you live there if you're poor you live there but high density it is and it's not just Asia São Paulo you can travel in a helicopter 45 minutes seeing those high-rise buildings consume the 19th-century low-rise environment And with it comes congestion and we lose mobility and so on and so forth So a few years ago we decided to go back and rethink Habitat Could we make it more affordable Could we actually achieve this quality of life in the densities that are prevailing today And we realized it's basically about light it's about sun it's about nature it's about fractalization Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior We came up with a number of models: economy models cheaper to build and more compact; membranes of housing where people could design their own house and create their own gardens And then we decided to take New York as a test case and we looked at Lower Manhattan And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan On the left is Manhattan today: blue for housing red for office buildings retail On the right we reconfigured it: the office buildings form the base and then rising 75 stories above are apartments There's a street in the air on the 25th level a community street It's permeable There are gardens and open spaces for the community almost every unit with its own private garden and community space all around And most important permeable open It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city and light permeates everywhere And in the last two or three years we've actually been for the first time realizing the quality of life of Habitat in real-life projects across Asia This in Qinhuangdao in China: middle-income housing where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight That's measured in the winter solstice And under construction in Singapore again middle-income housing gardens community streets and parks and so on and so forth And Colombo And I want to touch on one more issue which is the design of the public realm A hundred years after we've begun building with tall buildings we are yet to understand how the tall high-rise building becomes a building block in making a city in creating the public realm In Singapore we had an opportunity: 10 million square feet extremely high density Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces and you move from one to the other and there is contact with nature and most relevantly at every level of the structure public gardens and open space: on the roof of the podium climbing up the towers and finally on the roof the sky park two and a half acres jogging paths restaurants and the world's longest swimming pool And that's all I can tell you in five minutes Thank you When I turned 19 I started my career as the first female photojournalist in the Gaza Strip Palestine was considered a serious insult to local traditions for me and my family The male-dominated field made my presence unwelcome by all possible means They made clear that a woman must not do a man's job Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me because of my gender The No sign was pretty clear Three of my colleagues went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area were the only thing I could hear Dust was flying in the air and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep and drove away waving and laughing leaving me behind in the open air strike zone For a moment I felt terrified humiliated and sorry for myself My colleagues' action was not the only death threat I have received but it was the most dangerous one The perception of women's life in Gaza Until a recent time a lot of women were not allowed to work or pursue education At times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict women's dark and bright stories were fading away To men women's stories were seen as inconsequential to women's lives in Gaza Because of my gender I had access to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden Beyond the obvious pain and struggle there was a healthy dose of laughter and accomplishments In front of a police compound in Gaza City during the first war in Gaza an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound and break my nose For a moment all I saw was white bright white like these lights I thought to myself I either got blind or I was in heaven By the time I managed to open my eyes I had documented this moment Mohammed Khader a Palestinian worker who spent two decades in Israel as his retirement plan he decided to build a four-floor house only by the first field operation at his neighborhood the house was flattened to the ground Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised and a jacuzzi a bathtub that he got from Tel Aviv Mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath but to show the full frame of unseen stories of Gazans I became a witness with a choice: to run away or stand still Thank you America's favorite pie is Audience: Apple Kenneth Cukier: Apple Of course it is How do we know it Because of data You look at supermarket sales You look at supermarket sales of 30-centimeter pies that are frozen and apple wins no contest The majority of the sales are apple But then supermarkets started selling smaller 11-centimeter pies and suddenly apple fell to fourth or fifth place Why What happened Okay think about it When you buy a 30-centimeter pie the whole family has to agree and apple is everyone's second favorite But when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie you can buy the one that you want You can get your first choice You have more data You can see something that you couldn't see when you only had smaller amounts of it Now the point here is that more data doesn't just let us see more more of the same thing we were looking at More data allows us to see new It allows us to see better It allows us to see different In this case it allows us to see what America's favorite pie is: not apple Now you probably all have heard the term big data In fact you're probably sick of hearing the term big data It is true that there is a lot of hype around the term and that is very unfortunate because big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance In the past we used to look at small data and think about what it would mean to try to understand the world and now we have a lot more of it more than we ever could before What we find is that when we have a large body of data we can fundamentally do things that we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts Big data is important and big data is new and when you think about it the only way this planet is going to deal with its global challenges to feed people supply them with medical care supply them with energy electricity and to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp because of global warming is because of the effective use of data So what is new about big data What is the big deal Well to answer that question let's think about what information looked like physically looked like in the past In 1908 on the island of Crete archaeologists discovered a clay disc Now there's inscriptions on this disc but we actually don't know what it means It's a complete mystery but the point is that this is what information used to look like 4，000 years ago This is how society stored and transmitted information Now society hasn't advanced all that much We still store information on discs but now we can store a lot more information more than ever before Searching it is easier Copying it easier Sharing it is easier Processing it is easier And what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first collected the data In this respect the data has gone from a stock to a flow from something that is stationary and static to something that is fluid and dynamic There is if you will a liquidity to information The disc that was discovered off of Crete that's 4，000 years old is heavy it doesn't store a lot of information and that information is unchangeable By contrast all of the files that Edward Snowden took from the National Security Agency in the United States fits on a memory stick the size of a fingernail and it can be shared at the speed of light More data More Now one reason why we have so much data in the world today is we are collecting things that we've always collected information on but another reason why is we're taking things that have always been informational but have never been rendered into a data format and we are putting it into data Think for example the question of location Take for example Martin Luther If we wanted to know in the 1500s where Martin Luther was we would have to follow him at all times maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell and record it but now think about what it looks like today You know that somewhere probably in a telecommunications carrier's database there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times If you have a cell phone and that cell phone has GPS but even if it doesn't have GPS it can record your information In this respect location has been datafied Now think for example of the issue of posture the way that you are all sitting right now the way that you sit the way that you sit the way that you sit It's all different and it's a function of your leg length and your back and the contours of your back and if I were to put sensors maybe 100 sensors into all of your chairs right now I could create an index that's fairly unique to you sort of like a fingerprint but it's not your finger So what could we do with this Researchers in Tokyo are using it as a potential anti-theft device in cars The idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel tries to stream off but the car recognizes that a non-approved driver is behind the wheel and maybe the engine just stops unless you type in a password into the dashboard to say Hey I have authorization to drive Great What if every single car in Europe had this technology in it What could we do then Maybe if we aggregated the data maybe we could identify telltale signs that best predict that a car accident is going to take place in the next five seconds And then what we will have datafied is driver fatigue and the service would be when the car senses that the person slumps into that position automatically knows hey set an internal alarm that would vibrate the steering wheel honk inside to say Hey wake up pay more attention to the road These are the sorts of things we can do when we datafy more aspects of our lives So what is the value of big data Well think about it You have more information You can do things that you couldn't do before One of the most impressive areas where this concept is taking place is in the area of machine learning Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which itself is a branch of computer science The general idea is that instead of instructing a computer what do do we are going to simply throw data at the problem and tell the computer to figure it out for itself And it will help you understand it by seeing its origins In the 1950s a computer scientist at IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers so he wrote a computer program so he could play against the computer He played He won He played He won He played He won because the computer only knew what a legal move was Arthur Samuel knew something else Arthur Samuel knew strategy So he wrote a small sub-program alongside it operating in the background and all it did was score the probability that a given board configuration would likely lead to a winning board versus a losing board after every move He plays the computer He wins He plays the computer He wins He plays the computer He wins And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself It plays itself It collects more data It collects more data It increases the accuracy of its prediction And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it and he loses and he plays it and he loses and he plays it and he loses and Arthur Samuel has created a machine And this idea of machine learning is going everywhere How do you think we have self-driving cars Are we any better off as a society enshrining all the rules of the road into software No Memory is cheaper No Algorithms are faster No Processors are better No All of those things matter but that's not why It's because we changed the nature of the problem We changed the nature of the problem from one in which we tried to overtly and explicitly explain to the computer how to drive to one in which we say Here's a lot of data around the vehicle You figure it out You figure it out that that is a traffic light that that traffic light is red and not green that that means that you need to stop and not go forward Machine learning is at the basis search engines Amazon's personalization algorithm computer translation voice recognition systems Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies cancerous biopsies and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not and sure enough when you throw the data at it through a machine-learning algorithm the machine was able to identify the 12 telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous The problem: The medical literature only knew nine of them Three of the traits were ones that people didn't need to look for but that the machine spotted Now there are dark sides to big data as well It will improve our lives but there are problems that we need to be conscious of and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions that the police may use big data for their purposes a little bit like Minority Report Now it's a term called predictive policing or algorithmic criminology and the idea is that if we take a lot of data for example where past crimes have been we know where to send the patrols That makes sense but the problem of course is that it's not simply going to stop on location data it's going to go down to the level of the individual Why don't we use data about the person's high school transcript Maybe we should use the fact that they're unemployed or not their credit score their web-surfing behavior whether they're up late at night Their Fitbit when it's able to identify biochemistries will show that they have aggressive thoughts We may have algorithms that are likely to predict what we are about to do and we may be held accountable before we've actually acted Privacy was the central challenge in a small data era In the big data age the challenge will be safeguarding free will moral choice human volition human agency There is another problem: Big data is going to steal our jobs Big data and algorithms are going to challenge white collar professional knowledge work in the 21st century in the same way that factory automation and the assembly line challenged blue collar labor in the 20th century Think about a lab technician who is looking through a microscope at a cancer biopsy and determining whether it's cancerous or not The person went to university The person buys property He or she votes He or she is a stakeholder in society And that person's job as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person is going to find that their jobs are radically changed or actually completely eliminated Now we like to think that technology creates jobs over a period of time after a short temporary period of dislocation and that is true for the frame of reference with which we all live the Industrial Revolution because that's precisely what happened But we forget something in that analysis: There are some categories of jobs that simply get eliminated and never come back The Industrial Revolution wasn't very good if you were a horse So we're going to need to be careful and take big data and adjust it for our needs our very human needs We have to be the master of this technology not its servant We are just at the outset of the big data era and honestly we are not very good at handling all the data that we can now collect It's not just a problem for the National Security Agency Businesses collect lots of data and they misuse it too and we need to get better at this and this will take time It's a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire This is a tool but this is a tool that unless we're careful will burn us Big data is going to transform how we live how we work and how we think It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health but in the past we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T the technology the hardware because that's what was physical We now need to recast our gaze at the I the information which is less apparent but in some ways a lot more important Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it and that's why big data is a big deal We are at a remarkable moment in time We face over the next two decades two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries Let me illustrate with an example I first visited Beijing 25 years ago China was getting serious about market economics and about university education so they decided to call in the foreign experts Like most other people I moved around Beijing by bicycle Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle it was a safe and easy way to get around is a completely different prospect The roads are jammed by cars and trucks from the burning of coal and diesel When I was there last in the spring there was an advisory for people of my age over 65 to stay indoors and not move much How did this come about It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city It's doubled over those 25 years more than doubled dependent on dirty fuel dirty energy particularly coal China burns half the world's coal each year it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases that in that period China has grown remarkably It has become the world's second largest economy Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty That's really important But at the same time the people of China are asking the question: if our cities are unlivable They've analyzed diagnosed and development China's planning to scale back coal It's looking to build its cities in different ways Now the growth of China in the structure of the world economy Just 25 years ago the developing countries the poorer countries of the world were notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people Now it's more than half; 25 years from now it will probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw 25 years ago as developing That's a remarkable change It means that most countries around the world rich or poor are going to be facing that I want to talk about and highlight Now the first of these transformations through the description of Beijing Fifty percent now in urban areas That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050 Over the next two decades we'll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent and the growth in the economy and in the population is putting increasing pressure on our land on our water and on our forests This is profound structural change If we manage it in a negligent or a shortsighted way we will create waste pollution congestion destruction of land and forests If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated with my numbers cities energy land if we manage all that badly And more than that with immense risks to our climate Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already higher than they've been for millions of years If we go on increasing those concentrations we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years We've been around as Homo sapiens that's a rather generous definition sapiens for perhaps a quarter of a million years a quarter of a million We risk temperatures we haven't seen between human beings and the planet It would lead to changing deserts changing sea levels hundreds of millions of people perhaps billions of people who would have to move and if we've learned anything from history And we couldn't just turn it off You can't make a peace treaty with the planet You can't negotiate with the laws of physics You're in there You're stuck Those are the stakes we're playing for and that's why we have to make this second transformation the climate transformation Now the first of these transformations We have to decide whether to do it well or badly the economic or structural transformation But the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do Those two transformations face us in the next two decades The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do Now the more I've thought about this the two transformations coming together the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity or it's an opportunity which we can lose that I've identified: cities energy and land And let me start with cities I've already described the problems of Beijing: pollution congestion waste and so on Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world Now with cities like life but particularly cities you have to think ahead The cities that are going to be built and there are many and many big ones in a compact way The cities that already are there well established so that we can connect ourselves much better within those cities and make it easier encourage more people to live closer to the center We've got examples building around the world is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly in a non-polluting way in a city: very frequent buses strongly protected routes the same service really as an underground railway system but much much cheaper and can be done much more quickly a brilliant idea in many more cities around the world that's developing Now some things in cities do take time Some things in cities can happen much more quickly Take my hometown London In 1952 smog in London killed 4，000 people and badly damaged the lives of many many more And it happened all the time For those of you live outside London in the U。K will remember it used to be called The Smoke That's the way London was By regulating coal within a few years the problems of smog were rapidly reduced I remember the smogs well a few meters they stopped the buses and I had to walk This was the 1950s I had to walk home three miles from school Again breathing was a hazardous activity But it was changed It was changed by a decision striking results quickly We've seen more: In London we've introduced the congestion charge actually quite quickly and effectively and we've seen great improvements in the bus system and cleaned up the bus system You can see that the two transformations I've described the structural and the climate come very much together But we have to invest We have to invest in our cities and we have to invest wisely and if we do we'll see cleaner cities quieter cities safer cities more attractive cities more productive cities and stronger community in those cities public transport recycling reusing all sorts of things that bring communities together We can do that but we have to think we have to invest we have to plan Let me turn to energy Now energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels Over the next 20 years perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so We have to invest strongly in energy we have to use it much more efficiently and we have to make it clean We can see how to do that Take the example of California It would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was independent I don't want to start any California's a big place In the next five or six years they will likely move from around 20 percent in renewables wind solar and so on to over 33 percent and that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to where they were in 1990 a period when the economy in California would more or less have doubled That's a striking achievement It shows what can be done Not just California the incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes They've set themselves a target of five years I think they've got a good chance of doing that We'll see but what you're seeing now Four hundred million more than the population of the United States Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change Again you can see good decisions can bring quick results are intimately intertwined Do the first one well the structural the second one on the climate becomes much easier Look at land land and particularly forests Forests are the hosts to valuable They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere fundamental to the tackling of climate change But we're losing our forests In the last decade we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal and much more has been degraded But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that We can recognize the problem but we can also In Brazil the rate of deforestation has been reduced by 70 percent How By involving local communities investing in their agriculture and their economies by monitoring more carefully by enforcing the law more strictly And it's not just stopping deforestation That's of course of first and fundamental importance but it's also regrading degraded land regenerating rehabilitating degraded land I first went to Ethiopia in 1967 It was desperately poor In the following years and profoundly destructive social conflict Over the last few years actually more than a few Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly 15 years from now and to be carbon neutral Again I think it's a strong ambition You're seeing that commitment there You're seeing what can be done In Humbo in southwest Ethiopia has led to big increases in living standards from California to India from Brazil to Ethiopia how to manage those two transformations the structural and the climate We do understand how to manage those well I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this but you can see the electric cars you can see the batteries using new materials our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away You can see better insulation And there's much more coming But and it's a big but is moving far too slowly We're not cutting emissions in the way we should We're not managing those structural transformations as we can The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet The depth of understanding is not there yet We need political pressure to build We need leaders to step up We can have better growth better climate a better world We can make by managing those two transformations well the next 100 years the best of centuries If we make a mess of it we you and me if we make a mess of it if we don't manage those transformations properly it will be the next 100 years will be the worst of centuries of the report on the economy and climate chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico and I co-chaired that with him and we handed that report yesterday here in New York in the United Nations Building to the Secretary-General of the U。N。 Ban Ki-moon We know that we can do this Now two weeks ago I became a grandfather for the fourth time Our daughter Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago Here are Helen and Rosa Two weeks old Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye and tell them that we understood the issues that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities and still we failed to act Surely not Let's make the next 100 years the best of centuries What do you guys think For those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk I am a typical example of what he describes as the body as a form of transport for the head a university professor You might think it was not fair that I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks to speak about science I can't move my body to the beat and after a scientist who became a philosopher I have to talk about hard science It could be a very dry subject Yet I feel honored Never in my career and it's been a long career have I had the opportunity to start a talk feeling so inspired like this one Usually talking about science is like exercising in a dry place However I've had the pleasure The words water and dry do not match right It is even better to talk about water in the Amazon which is the splendid cradle of life Fresh life So this is what inspired me That's why I'm here although I'm carrying my head over here I am trying or will try to convey this inspiration I hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word We know that there is controversy The Amazon is the lung of the world because of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged between the forest and the atmosphere We also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity While many believe it few know it If you go out there in this marsh you'll be amazed at the You can barely see the animals The Indians say The forest has more eyes than leaves That is true and I will try to show you something But today I'm going to use a different approach one that is inspired by these two initiatives here a harmonic one and a philosophical one I'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic but it also attempts to convey that in nature there is extraordinary philosophy and harmony There'll be no music in my presentation I'm going to talk about physiology not about lungs but other analogies with human physiology especially the heart We'll start by thinking that water is like blood The circulation in our body distributes fresh blood which feeds nurtures and supports us and brings the used blood back to be renewed In the Amazon things happen similarly We'll start by talking about the power of all these processes This is an image of rain in motion What you see there is the years passing in seconds Rains all over the world What do you see The equatorial region in general and the Amazon specifically is extremely important for the world's climate It's a powerful engine There is a frantic evaporation taking place here If we take a look at this other image which shows the water vapor flow you have dry air in black moist air in gray and clouds in white What you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon What phenomenon if it's not a desert what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space What phenomenon is this It could be a geyser A geyser is underground water heated by magma exploding into the atmosphere and transferring this water into the atmosphere There are no geysers in the Amazon unless I am wrong I don't know of any But we have something that plays the same role with much more elegance though: the trees our good old friends that like geysers can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere There are 600 billion trees in the Amazon forest 600 billion geysers That is done with an extraordinary sophistication They don't need the heat of magma They use sunlight to do this process So in a typical sunny day in the Amazon a big tree manages to transfer 1，000 liters of water through its transpiration 1，000 liters If we take all the Amazon which is a very large area and add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration which is the sweat of the forest we'll get to an incredible number: 20 billion metric tons of water In one day Do you know how much that is The Amazon River the largest river on Earth one fifth of all the fresh water that leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans dumps 17 billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean This river of vapor that comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere is greater than the Amazon River Just to give you an idea If we could take a gigantic kettle the kind you could plug into a power socket an electric one and put those 20 billion metric tons of water in it how much power would you need to have this water evaporated Any idea A really big kettle A gigantic kettle right 50 thousand Itaipus Itaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world and Brazil is very proud of it because it provides more than 30 percent of the power that is consumed in Brazil And the Amazon is here doing this for free It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant providing environmental services Related to this subject we are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance which is curious If you look at the world map it's easy to see this you'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone and deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude 30 degrees south latitude aligned Look over there in the southern hemisphere the Atacama; Namibia and Kalahari in Africa; the Australian desert In the northern hemisphere the Sahara Sonoran etc There is an exception and it's curious: It's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiabá to Buenos Aires and from São Paulo to the Andes This quadrangle was supposed to be a desert It's on the line of deserts Why isn't it That's why I call it the paradox of chance What do we have in South America that is different If we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies like the water circulating in the landscape we see that rivers are veins they drain the landscape they drain the tissue of nature Where are the arteries Any guess What takes How does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature and bring everything back through rivers There is a new type of river which originates in the blue sea which flows through the green ocean it not only flows but it is also pumped by the green ocean and then it falls on our land All our economy that quadrangle 70 percent of South America's GDP comes from that area It depends on this river This river flows invisibly above us We are floating here on this floating hotel on one of the largest rivers on Earth the Negro River It's a bit dry and rough but we are floating here and there is this invisible river running above us This river has a pulse Here it is pulsing That's why we also talk about the heart You can see the different seasons there There's the rainy season In the Amazon we used to have two seasons the humid season and the even more humid season Now we have a dry season You can see the river covering that region which otherwise would be a desert And it is not We scientists You see that I'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other Scientists study how it works why etc and these studies are generating a series of discoveries which are absolutely fabulous to raise our awareness of the wealth the complexity and the wonder that we have the symphony we have in this process One of them is: How is rain formed Above the Amazon there is clean air as there is clean air above the ocean The blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds; there's almost no rain there The green ocean has the same clean air but forms a lot of rain What is happening here that is different The forest emits smells and these smells are condensation nuclei which form drops in the atmosphere Then clouds are formed and there is torrential rain The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden This relation between a living thing which is the forest and a nonliving thing which is the atmosphere is ingenious in the Amazon because the forest provides water and seeds and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back guaranteeing the forest's survival There are other factors as well We've talked a little about the heart and let's now talk about another function: the liver When humid air high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds which I call exogenous vitamin C generous vitamin C in the form of gas the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on Earth here in the Amazon because the plants take care of this characteristic as well This benefits the very way plants work which is another ingenious cycle Speaking of fractals and their relation with the way we work we can establish other comparisons As in the upper airways of our lungs the air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust The dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways This keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall When there are fires in the Amazon the smoke stops the rain it stops raining the forest dries up and catches fire There is another fractal analogy Like in the veins and arteries the rain water is a feedback It returns to the atmosphere Like endocrinal glands and hormones there are those gases which I told you about before that are formed and released into the atmosphere like hormones which help in the formation of rain Like the liver and the kidneys as I've said cleaning the air And finally like the heart: pumping water from outside from the sea into the forest We call it the biotic moisture pump a new theory that is explained in a very simple way If there is a desert in the continent with a nearby sea evaporation's greater on the sea and it sucks the air above the desert The desert is trapped in this condition It will always be dry If you have the opposite situation a forest the evaporation as we showed is much greater because of the trees and this relation is reversed The air above the sea is sucked into the continent and humidity is imported This satellite image was taken one month ago that's Manaus down there we're down there and it shows this process It's not a common little river that flows into a canal It's a mighty river that irrigates South America among other things This image shows those paths all the hurricanes that have been recorded You can see that in the red square there hardly are any hurricanes That is no accident This pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea and this prevents hurricane formations To close this part and sum up I'd like to talk about something a little different I have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories They think and so do I that we can save planet Earth I'm not talking only about the Amazon The Amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works We didn't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up We could understand it here though These colleagues propose that yes we can save other areas including deserts If we could establish forests in those other areas we can reverse climate change including global warming I have a dear colleague in India whose name is Suprabha Seshan and she has a motto Her motto is Gardening back the biosphere Reajardinando a biosfera in Portuguese She does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems We need to do this Having closed this quick introduction we see the reality that we have out here which is drought this climate change things that we already knew I'd like to tell you a short story Once about four years ago I attended a declamation of a text by Davi Kopenawa a wise representative of the Yanomami people and it went more or less like this: Doesn't the white man know that if he destroys the forest there will be no more rain And that if there's no more rain there'll be nothing to drink or to eat I heard that and my eyes welled up and I went Oh my I've been studying this for 20 years with a super computer dozens thousands of scientists and we are starting to get to this conclusion which he already knows A critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested How could they know the rain would end This bugged me and I was befuddled How could he know that Some months later I met him at another event and said Davi how did you know that if the forest was destroyed there'd be no more rain He replied: The spirit of the forest told us For me this was a game changer a radical change I said Gosh Why am I doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows Then something absolutely critical hit me which is seeing is believing Out of sight out of mind This is a need the previous speaker pointed out: We need to see things I mean we Western society which is becoming global civilized we need to see If we don't see we don't register the information We live in ignorance So I propose the following of course the astronomers wouldn't like the idea but let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down And let's make it look down here rather than to the far reaches of the universe The universe is wonderful but we have a practical reality which is we live in an unknown cosmos and we're ignorant about it We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us Talk to any astrophysicist The Earth is a statistical improbability The stability and comfort that we enjoy despite the droughts of the Negro River and all the heat and cold and typhoons etc。 there is nothing like it in the universe that we know of Then let's turn Hubble in our direction and let's look at the Earth Let's start with the Amazon Let's dive let's reach out the reality we live in every day and look carefully at it since that's what we need Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this He has something already that I think I missed I was educated by television I think that I missed this an ancestral record a valuation of what I don't know what I haven't seen He is not a doubting Thomas He believes with veneration and reverence in what his ancestors and the spirits taught him We can't do it so let's look into the forest Even with Hubble up there this is a bird's-eye view right Even when this happens we also see something that we don't know The Spanish called it the green inferno If you go out there into the bushes and get lost and let's say if you head west it's 900 kilometers to Colombia and another 1，000 to somewhere else So you can figure out why they called it the green inferno But go and look at what is in there It is a live carpet Each color you see is a tree species Each tree each tree top has up to 10，000 species of insects in it let alone the millions of species of fungi bacteria etc All invisible All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us than the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth which Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday I'm going to end my talk here I have a few seconds left by showing you this wonderful being When we see the morpho butterfly in the forest we feel like someone's left open the door to heaven and this creature escaped from there because it's so beautiful However I cannot finish without showing you a tech side We are tech-arrogant We deprive nature of its technology A robotic hand is technological mine is biological and we don't think about it anymore Let's then look at the morpho butterfly an example of an invisible technological competence of life which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet and let's zoom in on it Again Hubble is there Let's get into the butterfly's wings Scholars have tried to explain: Why is it blue Let's zoom in on it What you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates the best architects in the world All of this on a tiny scale Besides its beauty and functioning there is another side to it In nature all that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function This function of the morpho butterfly it is not blue; it does not have blue pigments It has photonic crystals on its surface according to people who studied it which are extremely sophisticated crystals Our technology had nothing like that at the time Hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology and it is used in optical fibers to transmit Janine Benyus who's been here several times talks about it: biomimetics My time's up Then I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity of this competence of biodiversity producing all these wonderful services: the living cell It is a structure with a few microns which is an internal wonder There are TED Talks about it I won't talk much longer but each person in this room including myself has 100 trillion of these micromachines in their body so that we can enjoy well-being Imagine what is out there in the Amazon forest: 100 trillion This is greater than the number of stars in the sky And we are not aware of it Thank you so much My grandfather was a cobbler Back in the day he made custom-made shoes I never got to meet him He perished in the Holocaust But I did inherit his love for making except that it doesn't exist that much anymore You see while the Industrial Revolution did a great deal to improve humanity it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it But all of that is about to change with 3D printing and it all started with this the very first part that was ever printed It's a little older than TED It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull who invented 3D printing But the thing that I want to talk to you about today the big idea that I want to discuss with you is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future but rather that it's actually going to connect us with our heritage and it's going to usher in a new era of localized distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication So think about useful things You all know your shoe size How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples Anybody Wouldn't it be awesome if you could for the first time get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge assembly so chances are the hinges are not going to break But the implications of 3D printing go well beyond the tips of our noses When I met Amanda for the first time she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable It was a beautiful robotic suit made by Ekso Bionics but it wasn't inspired by her body It wasn't made to measure So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine a little bit more elegant and lightweight and like good tailors we thought that we would measure her digitally And we did We built her an amazing suit The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves it's going to replace traditional methods Amanda looked at it and she said it's an opportunity for me to reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity And you know what She's not standing still She now wants to walk in high heels It doesn't stop there 3D printing is changing personalized medical devices as we know them from new beautiful conformal ventilated scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for amputees another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry And as we sit here today you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners or your dental restorations Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today Millions of people are served today from these devices What about full knee replacements from your data made to measure where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed G。E is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of about 14 million dollars Good for G。E。 right And their customers and the environment But you know the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for deep-pocketed corporations Planetary Resources a startup is going to put out its first space probe later this year It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship it costs a fraction of its cost and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts and it's going to be out in space later this year Google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone the Ara It's only possible because of the development of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional usable modules that will go into it A real moonshot powered by 3D printing How about food What if we could for the first time make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here that are edible What if we could completely change the experience like you see with that absinthe serving that is completely 3D printed And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors and flavors in every taste which means not only delicious foods but the promise of personalized nutrition around the corner And that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3D printing With 3D printing complexity is free The printer doesn't care if it makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape and that is completely turning design and manufacturing on its head as we know it Many people think that 3D printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it I think that it's the opportunity to put tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job opportunities and with that everybody can become an expert maker and an expert manufacturer That will take new tools Not everybody knows how to use CAD perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with digital clay When you do things like that and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instantly printable it will make it easier to create content but with all of the unimagined we will also have the unintended like democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession So many people ask me will we have a 3D printer in every home I think it's the wrong question to ask The right question to ask is how will 3D printing change my life Or in other words what room in my house will 3D printing fit in So everything that you see here has been 3D printed including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show Now these are not my grandfather's shoes These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local manufacturing My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl and my father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes He passed away three years ago But Chuck Hull the man that invented it all is right here in the house today and thanks to him I can say thanks to his invention I can say that I am a cobbler too and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the future Thank you So in 1781 an English composer technologist and astronomer called William Herschel noticed an object on the sky that didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did And Herschel's recognition that something was different that something wasn't quite right the planet Uranus a name that has entertained countless generations of children but a planet that overnight doubled the size of our known solar system Just last month NASA announced the discovery in orbit around nearby stars almost doubling overnight the number of planets we know about within our galaxy So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this capacity to collect data and with data almost doubling every year within the next two decades me may even reach the point for the first time in history where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies within the universe But as we enter this era of big data what we're beginning to find is there's a difference between more data being just better and more data being different capable of changing the questions we want to ask and this difference is not about how much data we collect it's whether those data open new windows into our universe whether they change the way we view the sky So what is the next window into our universe What is the next chapter for astronomy Well I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies that we're going to develop over the next decade and how these technologies together with the smart use of data may once again transform astronomy by opening up a window into our universe the window of time Why time Well time is about origins and it's about evolution The origins of our solar system how our solar system came into being is it unusual or special in any way About the evolution of our universe Why our universe is continuing to expand and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion But first I want to show you how technology is going to change the way we view the sky So imagine if you were sitting in the mountains of northern Chile looking out to the west towards the Pacific Ocean a few hours before sunrise This is the view of the night sky that you would see and it's a beautiful view with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon but it's also a static view and in many ways this is the way we think of our universe: eternal and unchanging But the universe is anything but static It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years Galaxies merge they collide at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour Stars are born they die they explode in these extravagant displays In fact if we could go back to our tranquil skies above Chile and we allow time to move forward to see how the sky might change over the next year the pulsations that you see are supernovae the final remnants of a dying star each one of these supernovae five billion times the brightness of our sun so we can see them to great distances but only for a short amount of time Ten supernova per second explode somewhere in our universe If we could hear it it would be popping like a bag of popcorn Now if we fade out the supernovae it's not just brightness that changes Our sky is in constant motion This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky are asteroids as they orbit our sun and it's these changes and the motion and it's the dynamics of the system that allow us to build our models for our universe to predict its future and to explain its past But the telescopes we've used over the last decade are not designed to capture the data at this scale The Hubble Space Telescope: for the last 25 years it's been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image of the sky it would take 13 million individual images about 120 years to do this just once So this is driving us to new technologies and new telescopes telescopes that can go faint to look at the distant universe but also telescopes that can go wide to capture the sky as rapidly as possible telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope or the LSST possibly the most boring name ever for one of the most fascinating experiments in the history of astronomy in fact proof if you should need it that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer to name anything not even your children We're building the LSST We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade I'm going to show you how we think it's going to transform our views of the universe because one image from the LSST is equivalent to 3，000 images from the Hubble Space Telescope each image three and a half degrees on the sky seven times the width of the full moon Well how do you capture an image at this scale Well you build the largest digital camera in history using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the High Street but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle where one image is three billion pixels So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution just a single LSST image it would take about 1，500 high-definition TV screens And this camera will image the sky taking a new picture every 20 seconds constantly scanning the sky so every three nights we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile Over the mission lifetime of this telescope it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth Now we can talk about this in terms of terabytes and petabytes and billions of objects but a way to get a sense of the amount of data that will come off this camera is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded simultaneously 24 hours a day seven days a week for 10 years And to process this data means searching through all of those talks for every new idea and every new concept looking at each part of the video to see how one frame may have changed from the next And this is changing the way that we do science changing the way that we do astronomy to a place where software and algorithms have to mine through this data where the software is as critical to the science as the telescopes and the cameras that we've built Now thousands of discoveries will come from this project but I'm just going to tell you about two of the ideas about origins and evolution that may be transformed by our access to data at this scale In the last five years NASA has discovered over 1，000 planetary systems around nearby stars but the systems we're finding aren't much like our own solar system and one of the questions we face is is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough or is there something special or unusual about how our solar system formed And if we want to answer that question we have to know and understand the history of our solar system in detail and it's the details that are crucial So now if we look back at the sky at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system The positions of the asteroids are like a fingerprint of an earlier time were much closer to the sun and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system they were scattering the asteroids in their wake So studying the asteroids is like performing forensics performing forensics on our solar system but to do this we need distance and we get the distance from the motion and we get the motion because of our access to time So what does this tell us Well if you look at the little yellow asteroids flitting across the screen these are the asteroids that are moving fastest because they're closest to us closest to Earth These are the asteroids we may one day send spacecraft to to mine them for minerals but they're also the asteroids that may one day impact the Earth like happened 60 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs or just at the beginning of the last century when an asteroid wiped out almost 1，000 square miles of Siberian forest or even just last year as one burnt up over Russia releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb So studying the forensics of our solar system doesn't just tell us about the past it can also predict the future including our future Now when we get distance we get to see the asteroids in their natural habitat in orbit around the sun So every point in this visualization that you can see is a real asteroid Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids dry and stony in the center water-rich and primitive towards the edge water-rich asteroids which may have seeded the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet when they bombarded the Earth at an earlier time Because the LSST will be able to go faint and not just wide we will be able to see these asteroids far beyond the inner part of our solar system to asteroids beyond the orbits of Neptune and Mars to comets and asteroids that may exist almost a light year from our sun And as we increase the detail of this picture increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100 we will be able to answer questions such as is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune to find Earth-impacting asteroids long before they're a danger and to find out whether maybe our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings that influenced the formation of our solar system and maybe that's one of the reasons why solar systems like ours seem to be so rare Now distance and changes in our universe distance equates to time as well as changes on the sky Every foot of distance you look away or every foot of distance an object is away you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe not once but multiple times The first time was in 1929 showed that the universe was expanding leading to the ideas of the Big Bang And the observations were simple: just 24 galaxies and a hand-drawn picture But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy the faster it was receding was enough to give rise to modern cosmology A second revolution happened 70 years later when two groups of astronomers showed that the universe wasn't just expanding it was accelerating a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky and finding out the higher that it gets the faster it moves away And they showed this by measuring the brightness of supernovae and how the brightness of the supernovae got fainter with distance And these observations were more complex They required new technologies and new telescopes because the supernovae were in galaxies that were 2，000 times more distant than the ones used by Hubble And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae because a supernova only explodes once every hundred years within a galaxy Three years to find 42 supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies And once they'd collected their data this is what they found Now this may not look impressive but this is what a revolution in physics looks like: a line predicting the brightness of a supernova 11 billion light years away and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line Small changes give rise to big consequences Small changes allow us to make discoveries like the planet found by Herschel Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head So 42 supernovae slightly too faint meaning slightly further away requiring that a universe must not just be expanding but this expansion must be accelerating revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy a component that drives this expansion and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget of our universe today So what is the next revolution likely to be Well what is dark energy and why does it exist Each of these lines shows a different model for what dark energy might be showing the properties of dark energy They all are consistent with the 42 points but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different Some people think about a dark energy that changes with time or whether the properties of the dark energy are different depending on where you look on the sky Others make differences and changes to the physics at the sub-atomic level Or they look at large scales and change how gravity and general relativity work or they say our universe is just one of many part of this mysterious multiverse but all of these ideas all of these theories amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy but all of them consistent with our 42 points So how can we hope to make sense of this over the next decade Well imagine if I gave you a pair of dice and I said you wanted to see whether those dice were loaded or fair One roll of the dice would tell you very little but the more times you rolled them the more data you collected the more confident you would become not just whether they're loaded or fair but by how much and in what way It took three years to find just 42 supernovae because the telescopes that we built could only survey a small part of the sky With the LSST we get a completely new view of the skies above Chile every three nights In its first night of operation it will find 10 times the number of supernovae used in the discovery of dark energy This will increase by 1，000 within the first four months: 1。5 million supernovae by the end of its survey each supernova a roll of the dice each supernova testing which theories of dark energy are consistent and which ones are not And so by combining these supernova data with other measures of cosmology we'll progressively rule out the different ideas and theories of dark energy until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030 we would expect to hopefully see a theory for our universe a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe to gradually emerge Now in many ways the questions that I posed are in reality the simplest of questions We may not know the answers but we at least know how to ask the questions But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies revealed 42 supernovae that turned our understanding of the universe on its head when we're working with billions of galaxies how many more times are we going to find 42 points that don't quite match what we expect Like the planet found by Herschel or dark energy or quantum mechanics or general relativity all ideas that came because the data didn't quite match what we expected What's so exciting about the next decade of data in astronomy is we don't even know how many answers are out there waiting answers about our origins and our evolution How many answers are out there that we don't even know the questions that we want to ask Thank you Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you three multiple choice questions Use this device Use this device to answer The first question is how did the number of deaths per year from natural disaster how did that change during the last century Did it more than double did it remain about the same in the world as a whole or did it decrease to less than half Please answer A B or C I see lots of answers This is much faster than I do it at universities They are so slow They keep thinking thinking thinking Oh very very good And we go to the next question So how long did women 30 years old in the world go to school: seven years five years or three years A B or C Please answer And we go to the next question In the last 20 years how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change Extreme poverty not having enough food for the day Did it almost double did it remain more or less the same or did it halve A B or C Now answers You see deaths from natural disasters in the world you can see it from this graph here from 1900 to 2000 In 1900 there was about half a million people who died every year from natural disasters: floods earthquakes volcanic eruption whatever droughts And then how did that change Gapminder asked the public in Sweden This is how they answered The Swedish public answered like this: Fifty percent thought it had doubled 38 percent said it's more or less the same 12 said it had halved This is the best data from the disaster researchers and it goes up and down and it goes to the Second World War and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling and it's down to much less than half The world has been much much more capable as the decades go by to protect people from this you know So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps The chimps don't watch the evening news so the chimps they choose by random so the Swedes answer worse than random Now how did you do That's you You were beaten by the chimps But it was close You were three times better than the Swedes but that's not enough You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes You must have higher ambitions in the world Let's look at the next answer here: women in school Here you can see men went eight years How long did women go to school Well we asked the Swedes like this and that gives you a hint doesn't it The right answer is probably the one the fewest Swedes picked isn't it Let's see let's see Here we come Yes yes yes women have almost caught up This is the U。S public And this is you Here you come Ooh Well congratulations you're twice as good as the Swedes but you don't need me So how come I think it's like this that everyone is aware that there are countries and there are areas where girls have great difficulties They are stopped when they go to school and it's disgusting But in the majority of the world where most people in the world live most countries girls today go to school as long as boys more or less That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved not at all They still are confined to terrible terrible limitations but schooling is there in the world today Now we miss the majority When you answer you answer according to the worst places and there you are right but you miss the majority What about poverty Well it's very clear that poverty here was almost halved and in U。S。 when we asked the public only five percent got it right And you Ah you almost made it to the chimps That little just a few of you There must be preconceived ideas you know And many in the rich countries they think that oh we can never end extreme poverty Of course they think so because they don't even know what has happened The first thing to think about the future is to know about the present These questions were a few of the first ones in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project in Gapminder Foundation that we run and it was started this project last year by my boss and also my son Ola Rosling He's cofounder and director and he wanted Ola told me we have to be more systematic when we fight devastating ignorance So already the pilots reveal this that so many in the public score worse than random so we have to think about preconceived ideas and one of the main preconceived ideas is about world income distribution Look here This is how it was in 1975 It's the number of people on each income from one dollar a day See there was one hump here around one dollar a day and then there was one hump here somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars The world was two groups It was a camel world like a camel with two humps the poor ones and the rich ones and there were fewer in between But look how this has changed: As I go forward what has changed the world population has grown and the humps start to merge The lower humps merged with the upper hump and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world with one hump only The percent in poverty has decreased Still it's appalling that so many remain in extreme poverty We still have this group almost a billion over there but that can be ended now The challenge we have now is to get away from that understand where the majority is and that is very clearly shown in this question We asked what is the percentage of the world's one-year-old children who have got those basic vaccines against measles and other things that we have had for many years: 20 50 or 80 percent Now this is what the U。S public and the Swedish answered Look at the Swedish result: you know what the right answer is Who the heck is a professor of global health in that country Well it's me It's me It's very difficult this It's very difficult However Ola's approach to really measure what we know made headlines and CNN published these results on their web and they had the questions there millions answered and I think there were about 2，000 comments and this was one of the comments I bet no member of the media passed the test he said So Ola told me Take these devices You are invited to media conferences Give it to them and measure what the media know And ladies and gentlemen for the first time the informal results from a conference with U。S media And then lately from the European Union media You see the problem is not that people don't read and listen to the media The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves What shall we do about this Ola Do we have any ideas Ola Rosling: Yes I have an idea but first I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps Fortunately I will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault actually Then I will equip you with some tricks for beating the chimps in the future That's basically what I will do But first let's look at why are we so ignorant and it all starts in this place It's Hudiksvall It's a city in northern Sweden It's a neighborhood where I grew up and it's a neighborhood with a large problem Actually it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well It was not representative Okay It gave me a very biased view of how life is on this planet So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle We have a personal bias We have all different experiences from communities and people we meet and on top of this we start school and we add the next problem Well I like schools but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews because they learned something when they went to school and now they describe this world to the students without any bad intentions and those books of course that are printed are outdated in a world that changes And there is really no practice to keep the teaching material up to date So that's what we are focusing on So we have these outdated facts added on top of our personal bias What happens next is news okay An excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines and people will read it because it's sensational Unusual events are more interesting no And they are exaggerated and especially things we're afraid of A shark attack on a Swedish person will get headlines for weeks in Sweden So these three skewed sources of information were really hard to get away from They kind of bombard us and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas and on top of it we put the very thing that makes us humans our human intuition It was good in evolution It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very very fast It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of and we seek causality where there is none and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers above the average Everybody answered that question Yeah I drive cars better Okay this was good evolutionarily but now when it comes to the worldview it is the exact reason why it's upside down The trends that are increasing are instead falling and the other way around and in this case the chimps use our intuition against us and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength It was supposed to be our strength wasn't it So how do we solve such problems First we need to measure it and then we need to cure it So by measuring it we can understand what is the pattern of ignorance We started the pilot last year and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter a lot of ignorance across the whole world and the idea is really to scale it up to all domains or dimensions of global development such as climate endangered species human rights gender equality energy finance All different sectors have facts and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts So I've started actually contacting some of them like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF and asking them what are your favorite facts which you think the public doesn't know Okay I gather those facts Imagine a long list with say 250 facts And then we poll the public and see where they score worst So we get a shorter list with the terrible results like some few examples from Hans and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results Okay this little shortlist what are we going to do with it Well we turn it into a knowledge certificate a global knowledge certificate which you can use if you're a large organization a school a university or maybe a news agency to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable Basically meaning we don't hire people who score like chimpanzees Of course you shouldn't So maybe 10 years from now if this project succeeds you will be sitting in an interview having to fill out this crazy global knowledge So now we come to the practical tricks How are you going to succeed There is of course one way which is to sit down late nights and learn all the facts by heart by reading all these reports That will never happen actually Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen People don't have that time People like shortcuts and here are the shortcuts We need to turn our intuition into strength again We need to be able to generalize So now I'm going to show you some tricks where the misconceptions are turned around into rules of thumb Let's start with the first misconception This is very widespread Everything is getting worse You heard it You thought it yourself The other way to think is most things improve So you're sitting with a question in front of you and you're unsure You should guess improve Okay Don't go for the worse That will help you score better on our tests That was the first one There are rich and poor and the gap is increasing It's a terrible inequality Yeah it's an unequal world but when you look at the data it's one hump Okay If you feel unsure go for the most people are in the middle That's going to help you get the answer right Now the next preconceived idea is first countries and people need to be very very rich to get the social development like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters No no no That's wrong Look: that huge hump in the middle already have girls in school So if you are unsure go for the the majority already have this like electricity and girls in school these kinds of things They're only rules of thumb so of course they don't apply to everything but this is how you can generalize Let's look at the last one If something yes this is a good one sharks are dangerous No well yes but they are not so important in the global statistics that is what I'm saying I actually I'm very afraid of sharks So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of which might be earthquakes other religions maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks anything that makes me feel assume you're going to exaggerate the problem That's a rule of thumb Of course there are dangerous things that are also great Sharks kill very very few That's how you should think With these four rules of thumb you could probably answer better than the chimps because the chimps cannot do this They cannot generalize these kinds of rules And hopefully we can turn your world around and we're going to beat the chimps Okay That's a systematic approach Now the question is this important Yeah it's important to understand poverty extreme poverty and how to fight it and how to bring girls in school When we realize that actually it's succeeding we can understand it But is it important for everyone else who cares about the rich end of this scale I would say yes extremely important for the same reason If you have a fact-based worldview of today you might have a chance to understand what's coming next in the future We're going back to these two humps in 1975 That's when I was born and I selected the West That's the current EU countries and North America Let's now see how the rest and the West compares in terms of how rich you are These are the people who can afford to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation In 1975 only 30 percent of them lived outside EU and North America But this has changed okay So first let's look at the change up till today 2014 Today it's 50/50 The Western domination is over as of today That's nice So what's going to happen next Do you see the big hump Did you see how it moved I did a little experiment I went to the IMF International Monetary Fund website They have a forecast for the next five years of GDP per capita So I can use that to go five years into the future assuming the income inequality of each country is the same I did that but I went even further I used those five years for the next 20 years with the same speed just as an experiment what might actually happen Let's move into the future In 2020 it's 57 percent in the rest In 2025 63 percent 2030 68 And in 2035 the West is outnumbered in the rich consumer market These are just projections of GDP per capita into the future Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers are going to live outside North America and Europe So yes I think it's a good idea for a company to use this certificate to make sure to make fact- based decisions in the future Thank you very much My dream is to build the world's first underground park in New York City Now why would someone want to build an underground park and why in New York City These three tough little buggers are on the left my grandmother age five and then her sister and brother ages 11 and nine This photo was taken just before they left from Italy to immigrate to the United States just about a century ago And like many immigrants at the time they arrived on the Lower East Side in New York City and they encountered a crazy melting pot What was amazing about their generation was that they were not only building new lives in this new unfamiliar area but they were also literally building the city I've always been fascinated by those decades and by that history and I would often beg my grandmother to tell me as many stories as possible about the old New York But she would often just shrug it off tell me to eat more meatballs more pasta and so I very rarely got any of the history that I wanted to hear about The New York City that I encountered felt pretty built up I always knew as a kid that I wanted to make a difference and to somehow make the world more beautiful more interesting and more just I just didn't really know how At first I thought I wanted to go work abroad so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya But it felt weird to me that I knew more about local Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown I took a job with the City of New York but very quickly felt frustrated with the slowness of government bureaucracy I even took a job at Google where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid and believed almost wholeheartedly that technology could solve all social problems But I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place It was in 2009 that my friend and now business partner James Ramsey alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site which is this This is the former trolley terminal that was the depot for passengers traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan and it was open between 1908 and 1948 just around the time when my grandparents were living right in the area And we learned also that the site was entirely abandoned in 1948 Fascinated by this discovery we begged the authorities to draw us into the space and we finally got a tour and this is what we saw Now this photo doesn't really do it justice It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space It's a football field of unused land immediately below a very crowded area of the city and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones on an archaeological dig and all the details are all still there It's really pretty remarkable Now the site itself is located at the very heart of the Lower East Side and today it still remains one of the most crowded neighborhoods in the city New York City has two thirds the green space per resident as other big cities and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space So we immediately started thinking about how we could take this site and turn it into something that could be used for the public but also could potentially even be green Our plan in a nutshell is to draw natural sunlight underground using a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street directs it below the city sidewalks and would allow plants and trees to grow with the light that's directed underneath With this approach you could take a site that looks like this today and transform it into something that looks like this In 2011 we first released some of these images and what was funny was a lot of people said to us Oh it kind of looks like the High Line underground And so what our nickname ended up becoming and what ended up sticking was the Lowline so the Lowline was born What was also clear was that people really wanted to know a lot more about how the technology would look and feel and that there was really much more interest in this than we had ever thought possible So like a crazy person I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project Here is us with our team putting together a technology demonstration in a warehouse Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy which we built to show the technology You can see the six solar collectors at the center there And here's the full exhibit all put together in this warehouse You can see the solar canopy overhead the light streaming in and this entirely live green space below So in the course of just a few weeks tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit and since that time we've grown our numbers of supporters both locally and among design enthusiasts all over the world Here's a rendering of the neighborhood just immediately above the Line's site and a rendering of how it will look after major redevelopment that is coming over the course of the next 10 years Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels and how there's really a lack of green space So what we're proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area And right now we're focusing very closely on how we engage with the City of New York on really transforming the overall ecosystem in an integrated way Here's our rendering of how we would actually invite people into the space itself So here you see this iconic entrance in which we would literally peel up the street and reveal the historical layers of the city and invite people into this warm underground space In the middle of winter when it's absolutely freezing outside the last place you'd want to go would be an outdoor space or outdoor park The Lowline would really be a four-season space and a respite for the city So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings my own family's story full circle If my grandparents and my parents were really focused on building the city up and out I think my generation is focused on reclaiming the spaces that we already have rediscovering our shared history and reimagining how we can make our communities more interesting more beautiful and more just Thanks I'm an industrial engineer The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources While working at Toyota all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr Akira Miyawaki who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon-neutral I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer Soon I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house and this is how it looks after three years These forests compared to a conventional plantation grow 10 times faster and 100 times more biodiverse Within two years of having this forest in our backyard I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers the number of bird species I spotted in this area doubled and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house I wanted to make more of these forests I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business so I founded a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry we had to standardize the process of forest-making So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest-making For an example the core of TPS which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line We replaced these cars with trees using which now we can make multi-layered forests These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space They are so dense that one can't even walk into them For an example we can make a 300-tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers For example coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted Once planted we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere And using these simple improvisations today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone Today we are making forests in houses in schools even in factories with the corporates But that's not enough There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands So we let it happen Today we are working on an Internet-based platform where we are going to share our methodology using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there using our methodology At the click of a button they can get to know all the native species of their place By installing a small hardware probe on site we can do remote soil testing using which we can give step-by-step instructions on forest-making remotely Also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site This methodology I believe has a potential By sharing we can actually bring back our native forests Now when you go back home if you see a barren piece of land Thank you very much Thanks Hi kids I'm 71 My husband is 76 My parents are in their late 90s and Olivia the dog is 16 So let's talk about aging Let me tell you how I feel when I see my wrinkles in the mirror and I realize that some parts of me have dropped and I can't find them down there Mary Oliver says in one of her poems Tell me what is it that you plan to do with your one wild and precious life Me I intend to live passionately When do we start aging Society decides when we are old usually around 65 when we get Medicare but we really start aging at birth We are aging right now and we all experience it differently We all feel younger than our real age because the spirit never ages I am still 17 Sophia Loren Look at her She says that everything

tenderness and he is grateful to the people who help him What have I gained Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was who I want to be or what other people expect me to be I don't have to please men anymore only animals I keep telling my superego to back off and let me enjoy what I still have My body may be falling apart but my brain is not yet I love my brain I feel lighter I don't carry grudges ambition vanity worth the trouble It's great to let go I should have started sooner And I also feel softer because I'm not scared of being vulnerable I don't see it as weakness anymore And I've gained spirituality I'm aware that before death was in the neighborhood Now it's next door or in my house I try to live mindfully and be present in the moment By

seductive and sexy Yes I Aww thank you Hands down I No it's makeup Moderator: Now would it be awkward if I asked you a follow-up question about your erotic fantasies I Oh of course About what Moderator: About your erotic fantasies I With Antonio Banderas Moderator: I was just wondering if you have anything more to share I Well one of them is that on a Mexican tortilla I slather him with guacamole and salsa I roll him up and I eat him Thank you Talking about empowerment is odd because when we talk about empowerment what affects us most are the stories So I want to begin with an everyday story What is it really like to be a young woman in India Now I've spent the last 27 years of my life in India lived in three small towns two major cities and I've had several experiences When I was seven a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me He would put his hand up my skirt He put his hand up my skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good At 17 a boy from my high school detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because I didn't pay attention to him At 19 I helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage At 21 when my friend and I were walking down the road one afternoon a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us We called people for help and nobody came At 25 when I was walking home one evening two men on a motorcycle attacked me I spent two nights in the hospital recovering from trauma and injuries So throughout my life I've seen women family friends colleagues live through these experiences and they seldom talk about it So in simple words life in India is not easy But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on So what happened one night in December 2012 changed my life So a young girl a 23-year-old student boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend There were six men on the bus young men who you might encounter every day in India and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the Indian and international media This girl was raped repeatedly forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod beaten bitten and left to die Her friend was gagged attacked and knocked unconscious She died on the 29th of December And at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year India plunged into darkness men and women in Indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country Now like many other young women I was absolutely terrified I couldn't believe that something like this could happen in a national capital I was angry and I was frustrated but most of all I felt utterly completely helpless But really what do you do right Some write blogs some ignore it some join protests I did all of it In fact that was what everyone was doing all the horrific deeds that Indian men are capable of They were compared to animals sexually repressed beasts In fact so alien and unthinkable was this event that the response from the Indian media public and politicians proved one point: No one knew what to do And no one wanted to be responsible for it In fact these were a few insensitive comments in response to sexual violence against women in general the second one is made by a spiritual leader and the third one was actually the defendants' lawyer when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away Now as a woman watching this day after day I was tired So as a writer and gender activist I have written extensively on women but this time I realized it was different because a part of me realized I was a part of that young woman too and I decided I wanted to change this So I did something spontaneous hasty I logged on to a citizen journalism platform called iReport and I recorded a video talking about what the scene was like in Bangalore I talked about how I felt I talked about the ground realities and I talked about the frustrations of living in India In a few hours the blog was shared widely and comments and thoughts poured in from across the world In that moment a few things occurred to me One technology was always at hand for many young women like me Two like me most young women hardly use it to express their views Three I realized for the first time that my voice mattered So in the months that followed I covered a trail of events in Bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news In Cubbon Park which is a big park in Bangalore I gathered with over 100 others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape When I reported about these events I felt I had charge I felt like I had a channel to release all the emotions I had inside me I attended the town hall march Kill them hang them You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters I went to a candlelight vigil where citizens gathered together to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly and I recorded a lot of blogs in response to how worrying the situation was in India at that point I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say Now the reactions confused me While supportive comments poured in from across the world as did vicious ones So some called me a hypocrite Some called me a victim a rape apologist Some even said I had a political motive But this one comment kind of describes what we are discussing here today But I was soon to learn that this was not all As empowered as I felt with the new liberty that this citizen journalism channel gave me I found myself in an unfamiliar situation So sometime last August I logged onto Facebook and I was looking through my news feed and I noticed there was a link that was being shared by my friends I clicked on the link; it led me back to a report uploaded by an American girl called Michaela Cross India: The story you never wanted to hear And in this report she recounted her firsthand account of facing sexual harassment in India She wrote There is no way to prepare for the eyes the eyes that every day stared with such entitlement at my body with no change of expression whether I met their gaze or not Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's I got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell She said she was stalked groped and masturbated at Now late that evening the report went viral Everyone was discussing it It had over a million views a thousand comments and shares and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever So that night as I sat wondering how I should respond I found myself filled with doubt You see as a writer I approached this issue as an observer as an Indian I felt embarrassment and disbelief and as an activist I looked at it as a defender of rights but as a citizen journalist I suddenly felt very vulnerable I mean here she was a young woman who was using a channel to talk about her experience just as I was and yet I felt unsettled You see no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act Empowerment is often made to sound as if it's an ideal it's a wonderful outcome When we talk about empowerment we often talk about giving people access to materials giving them access to tools But the thing is empowerment is an emotion It's a feeling The first step to empowerment is to give yourself the authority the key to independent will and for women everywhere no matter who we are or where we come from that is the most difficult step We fear the sound of our own voice for it means admission but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment Now in this situation where I was faced with so many different kinds of realities I was unsure how to judge because I didn't know what it would mean for me I feared to judge because I didn't know what it would be if I didn't support the same view as this girl I didn't know what it would mean for me if I was challenging someone else's truth But yet it was simple I had to make a decision: Should I speak up or should I stay quiet So after a lot of thought I recorded a video blog in response and I told Michaela well there are different sides to India and I also tried to explain on air with her and for the first time I reached out to this girl who I had never met who was so far away but yet I felt so close to Since this report came to light more young people than ever were discussing sexual harassment on the campus and the university that Michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed The university even took measures to train its students to equip them with the skills that they need to confront challenges such as harassment and for the first the time I felt I wasn't alone You see if there's anything that I've learned as an active citizen journalist over the past few years it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard We don't realize that when we are standing up we are not just standing up as individuals we are standing up for our communities our friends our peers Most of us say that women are denied their rights but the truth is oftentimes women deny themselves these rights In a recent survey in India 95 percent of the women who work in I。T。 aviation hospitality and call centers said they didn't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening In Bangalore where I come from this number is 85 percent In rural areas in India if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha and Aligarh are supposed to go by we need to act really soon the challenges that women will face in telling their stories is real but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums and not just pursue the media blindly Today more women than ever are standing up and questioning the government in India and this is a result of that courage reporting harassment and the government passed to protect women against sexual assault As I end this talk I just want to say that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets but let us speak up Let us fight the shame and talk about it It could be a platform a community your loved one whoever or whatever you choose but let us speak up The truth is the end to this problem begins with us Thank you In Kenya 1984 is known as the year of the cup or the goro goro The goro goro is a cup used to measure two kilograms of maize flower on the market and the maize flower is used to make ugali a polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables Both the maize and the vegetables are grown on most Kenyan farms which means that most families can feed themselves from their own farm One goro goro can feed three meals for an average family and in 1984 the whole harvest could fit in one goro goro It was and still is one of the worst droughts in living memory Now today I insure farmers against droughts like those in the year of the cup or to be more specific I insure the rains I come from a family of missionaries who built hospitals in Indonesia and my father built a psychiatric hospital in Tanzania This is me age five in front of that hospital I don't think they thought I'd grow up to sell insurance So let me tell you how that happened In 2008 I was working for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda and my boss had just been promoted to become the minister She launched an ambitious plan to start a green revolution in her country and before we knew it we were importing tons of fertilizer and seed and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer and plant A couple of weeks later the International Monetary Fund visited us and asked my minister Minister it's great that you want to help farmers reach food security but what if it doesn't rain My minister answered proudly and somewhat defiantly I am going to pray for rain That ended the discussion On the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said Rose you've always been interested in finance Go find us some insurance It's been six years since and last year I was fortunate enough to be part of a team that insured over 185，000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda against drought They owned an average of half an acre and paid on average two Euros in premium It's microinsurance Now traditional insurance doesn't work with two to three Euros of premium because traditional insurance relies on farm visits A farmer here in Germany would be visited for the start of the season halfway through and at the end and again if there was a loss to estimate the damages For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa the maths of doing those visits simply don't add up So instead we rely on technology and data This satellite measures whether there were clouds or not because think about it: If there are clouds then you might have some rain but if there are no clouds then it's actually impossible for it to rain These images show the onset of the rains this season in Kenya You see that around March 6 the clouds move in and then disappear and then around the March 11 the clouds really move in That and those clouds were the onset of the rains this year This satellite covers the whole of Africa and goes back as far as 1984 and that's important because if you know how many times a place has had a drought in the last 30 years you can make a pretty good estimate what the chances are of drought in the future and that means that you can put a price tag on the risk of drought The data alone isn't enough We devise agronomic algorithms which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when For example for maize at planting you need to have two days of rain for farmers to plant and then it needs to rain once every two weeks for the crop to properly germinate After that you need rain every three weeks for the crop to form its leaves whereas at flowering you need it to rain more frequently about once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob At the end of the season you actually don't want it to rain because rains then can damage the crop Devising such a cover is difficult but it turned out the real challenge was selling insurance We set ourselves a modest target of 500 farmers insured after our first season After a couple of months' intense marketing we had signed up the grand total of 185 farmers I was disappointed and confounded Everybody kept telling me that farmers wanted insurance but our prime customers simply weren't buying They were waiting to see what would happen didn't trust insurance companies or thought I've managed for so many years Why would I buy insurance now Now many of you know microcredit the method of providing small loans to poor people pioneered by Muhammad Yunus who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the Grameen Bank Turns out selling microcredit isn't the same as selling insurance For credit a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank and if it succeeds the bank will advance him money That's an attractive proposition For insurance the farmer needs to trust the insurance company and needs to advance the insurance company money It's a very different value proposition And so the uptick of insurance has been slow with so far only 4。4 percent of Africans taking up insurance in 2012 and half of that number is in one country South Africa We tried for some years selling insurance directly to farmers with very high marketing cost and very limited success Then we realized that there were many organizations working with farmers: seed companies microfinance institutions mobile phone companies government agencies They were all providing loans to farmers and often just before they'd finalize the loan the farmer would say But what if it doesn't rain How do you expect me to repay my loan Many of these organizations were taking on the risk themselves simply hoping that that year the worst wouldn't happen Most of the organizations however were limiting their growth in agriculture They couldn't take on this kind of risk These organizations became our customers and when combining credit and insurance interesting things can happen Let me tell you one more story At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya the rains started and they started early and when rains start early farmers are encouraged because it usually means that the season is going to be good So they took out loans and planted For the next three weeks there wasn't a single drop of rain and the crops that had germinated so well shriveled and died We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution that had provided those loans to about 6，000 farmers in that area and we called them up and said Look we know about the drought We've got you We'll give you 200，000 Euros at the end of the season They said Wow that's great but that'll be late Could you give us the money now Then these farmers can still replant and can get a harvest this season So we convinced our insurance partners and later that April these farmers replanted We took the idea of replanting to a seed company and convinced them to price the cost of insurance into every bag of seed and in every bag we packed a card that had a number on it and when the farmers would open the card they'd text in that number and that number would actually help us to locate the farmer and allocate them to a satellite pixel A satellite would then measure the rainfall for the next three weeks and if it didn't rain we'd replace their seed One of the first Hold on I'm not there One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee was Bosco Mwinyi We visited his farm later that August and I wish I could show you the smile on his face when he showed us his harvest because it warmed my heart and it made me realize why selling insurance can be a good thing But you know he insisted that we get his whole harvest in the picture so we had to zoom out a lot Insurance secured his harvest that season and I believe that today we have all the tools to enable African farmers to take control of their own destiny No more years of the cup Instead I am looking forward to at least somehow the year of the insurance or the year of the great harvest Thank you Ten years ago I wrote a book which I entitled My publishers cut out the question mark The American publishers changed our title to Our Final Hour Americans like instant gratification and the reverse And my theme was this: Our Earth has existed for 45 million centuries but this one is special it's the first where one species ours has the planet's future in its hands Over nearly all of Earth's history threats have come from nature disease earthquakes asteroids and so forth but from now on the worst dangers come from us And it's now not just the nuclear threat; in our interconnected world network breakdowns can cascade globally; air travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days; and social media can spread panic and rumor literally at the speed of light We fret too much about minor hazards improbable air crashes carcinogens in food low radiation doses and so forth but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios The worst have thankfully not yet happened Indeed they probably won't But if an event is potentially devastating it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it even if it's unlikely just as we take out fire insurance on our house And as science offers greater power and promise the downside gets scarier too We get ever more vulnerable Within a few decades millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech just as they misuse cybertech today Freeman Dyson in a TED Talk foresaw that children will design and create new organisms just as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets Well this may be on the science fiction fringe but were even part of his scenario to come about our ecology and even our species would surely not survive long unscathed For instance there are some eco-extremists who think that it would be better for the planet for Gaia if there were far fewer humans What happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by 2050 And by then other science fiction nightmares may transition to reality: dumb robots going rogue or a network that develops a mind of its own threatens us all Well can we guard against such risks by regulation We must surely try but these enterprises are so competitive so globalized and so driven by commercial pressure that anything that can be done will be done somewhere whatever the regulations say It's like the drug laws we try to regulate but can't And the global village will have its village idiots and they'll have a global range So as I said in my book we'll have a bumpy ride through this century There may be setbacks to our society indeed a 50 percent chance of a severe setback But are there conceivable events that could be even worse events that could snuff out all life When a new particle accelerator came online some people anxiously asked could it destroy the Earth or even worse rip apart the fabric of space Well luckily reassurance could be offered I and others pointed out that nature has done the same experiments zillions of times already via cosmic ray collisions But scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without precedent in the natural world Biologists should avoid release of potentially devastating genetically modified pathogens And by the way our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question and it's this: Consider two scenarios Scenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity Scenario B wipes out 100 percent How much worse is B than A Some would say 10 percent worse The body count is 10 percent higher But I claim that B is incomparably worse As an astronomer I can't believe that humans are the end of the story It is five billion years before the sun flares up and the universe may go on forever so post-human evolution here on Earth and far beyond could be as prolonged as the Darwinian process that's led to us and even more wonderful And indeed future evolution will happen much faster on a technological timescale not a natural selection timescale So we surely in view of those immense stakes shouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk that human extinction would foreclose this immense potential Some scenarios that have been envisaged may indeed be science fiction but others may be disquietingly real It's an important maxim that the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable and in fact that's why we at Cambridge University are setting up a center to study how to mitigate these existential risks It seems it's worthwhile just for a few people to think about these potential disasters And we need all the help we can get from others because we are stewards of a precious pale blue dot in a vast cosmos a planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it And so let's not jeopardize that future And I'd like to finish with a quote from a great scientist called Peter Medawar I quote The bells that toll for mankind are like the bells of Alpine cattle They are attached to our own necks and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and melodious sound Thank you very much These are simple objects: clocks keys combs glasses carried with them on their final journey We are all familiar with these mundane everyday objects The fact that some of the victims carried personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them Usually they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland and as we speak forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves 20 years after the war And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered During the four years of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s approximately 30，000 citizens mainly civilians went missing presumed killed and another 100，000 were killed during combat operations Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hostilities when U。N safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army The international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial political religious or ethnic group As much as genocide is about killing It is also about destroying their property their cultural heritage and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed Genocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied identity There are always traces no such thing as a perfect crime There are always remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our selective and fading memory of them These items are recovered from numerous mass graves and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the killings the first act of genocide on European soil since the Holocaust Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified Once recovered these items that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned analyzed catalogued and stored Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on CSI These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual identification of the victims but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify these items physically but physical browsing is extremely difficult an ineffective and painful process Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects they become orphans of the narrative Many of them get destroyed believe it or not or they get simply shelved out of sight and out of mind I decided a few years ago to photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors could easily browse As a storyteller I like to give back to the community I like to move beyond raising awareness And in this case someone may recognize these items or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened Photography is about empathy and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy In this case I am merely a tool a forensic if you like and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document Once all the missing persons are identified only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain In all their simplicity these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed Thank you very much Oliver was an extremely dashing handsome charming and largely unstable male that I completely lost my heart to He was a Bernese mountain dog and my ex-husband and I adopted him and about six months in we realized that he was a mess He had such paralyzing separation anxiety that we couldn't leave him alone Once he jumped out of our third floor apartment He ate fabric He ate things recyclables He hunted flies that didn't exist He suffered from hallucinations He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder and that's really just the tip of the iceberg But like with humans sometimes it's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues And most of us do not take the person we're dating back to the bar where we met them or give them back to the friend that introduced us or sign them back up on Match。com We love them anyway and we stick to it and that is what I did with my dog And I was a I'd studied biology I have a Ph。D in history of science from MIT and had you asked me 10 years ago if a dog I loved or just dogs generally had emotions I would have said yes that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder a Prozac prescription and a therapist But then I fell in love and I realized that they can and actually trying to help my own dog overcome his panic and his anxiety it just changed my life It cracked open my world And I spent the last seven years actually looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals and if so what does it mean about us And what I discovered is that I do believe they can suffer from mental illness and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help us better understand ourselves So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute Many of us think that we can't know what another animal is thinking and that is true but any of you in relationships at least this is my case just because you ask someone that you're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn't mean that they can tell you They may not have words to explain what it is that they're feeling and they may not know It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress Before the early 20th century physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation mental illness in other animals isn't actually that much of a stretch Most mental disorders in the United States are fear and anxiety disorders and when you think about it fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions Usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous and once we feel them we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous The problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it Mood disorders too may actually just be the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed This tips into the territory of mental illness when you do things like compulsively over-wash your hands or paws or you develop a ritual that's so extreme that you can't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage in that ritual So for humans we have the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual which is basically an atlas In other animals we have YouTube This is just one search I did for OCD dog but I encourage all of you to look at OCD cat You will be shocked by what you see I'm going to show you just a couple examples This is an example of shadow-chasing I know and it's funny and in some ways it's cute The issue though is that dogs can develop compulsions like this that they then engage in all day So they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat They'll develop fixations but he does this for many many many hours a day He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen This is another example of what's considered This is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting And if you just sort of happened upon this scene you might think that Ting Ting is just playing with a stick but Ting Ting does this all day and if you pay close attention you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time Other super common behaviors that you may see particularly in captive animals are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies and actually humans do this too and in us we'll sway we'll move from side to side Many of us do this and sometimes it's an effort to soothe ourselves and I think in other animals that is often the case too But it's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in This is Gigi She's a gorilla that lives at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist and she's been treated for a mood disorder among other things Many animals develop mood disorders Lots of creatures this horse is just one example develop self-destructive behaviors They'll gnaw on things Turns out if you have fur or feathers or skin you can pluck yourself compulsively and some parrots actually have been studied something that affects 20 million Americans right now Lab rats pluck themselves too In them it's called barbering Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine PTSD and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments They can be too scared to approach men with beards or to hop into cars I want to be careful and be clear though I do not think that canine PTSD is the same as human PTSD But I also do not think that my PTSD is like your PTSD We are all different We also all have very different susceptibilities So two dogs raised in the same household exposed to the very same things So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently: Is this just an instance of humans Or is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse And it turns out we're actually so much more complicated than that So one great thing that has happened to me is recently I published a book on this and every day now that I open my email or when I go to a reading people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met And recently I did a reading in California Dr Braitman I think my cat has PTSD And I said Well why Tell me a little bit about it and she used to live with an elderly man and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack and he died A week later Ping was discovered in the apartment alongside the body of her owner and the vacuum had been running the entire time For many months up to I think two years after that incident she was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning She was quite literally a scaredy cat She would hide in the closet She was un-self-confident and shaky but with the loving support of her family a lot of a time and their patience now three years later she's actually a happy confident cat Another story of trauma and recovery that I came across was actually a few years ago I was in Thailand to do some research I met a monkey named Boonlua and when Boonlua was a baby he was attacked by a pack of dogs and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery where the monks took him in They called in a veterinarian who treated his wounds Eventually Boonlua wound up at an elephant facility and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing and they figured out what he liked which it turned out was mint Mentos But they worried because he was social that he was lonely and they didn't want to put him in with another monkey because they thought with just one arm he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play And so they gave him a rabbit and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey They groomed each other they become close friends and then the rabbit had bunnies and Boonlua was even happier than he was before and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning that he decided not to sleep He became extremely protective of these bunnies and he stopped sleeping and he would sort of nod off while trying to take care of them In fact he was so protective and so affectionate eventually had to take them away from him because he was so protective he was worried that their mother might hurt them So after they were taken away the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression and so to avoid that they gave him another rabbit friend My official opinion is that he does not look depressed So one thing that I would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered to make some assumptions about the creatures that you know well that you happen to know if you think that they are traumatized or depressed you're probably right This is extremely anthropomorphic onto non-human animals or things to think about another animal thinking about the emotional experience of another animal So then the choice becomes how do you anthropomorphize well Or do you anthropomorphize poorly is all too common It may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection There's all manner of things Anthropomorphizing well however I believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other animals' minds and experiences and there's actually an entire industry that is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry One in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics It turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals These drugs were tested in non-human animals first The antianxiety medication Librium and made them into peaceable felines And even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits Today however we are not just giving these drugs both in ethical and much less ethical ways SeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications But dogs like my own Oliver are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic Just recently actually a study came out in Science responded to antianxiety medication It made them braver less skittish and more likely to explore their environment It's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs but I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing from seven billion dollars in 2011 Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely Others like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his Paxil prescription and then distribute it among the other bonobos More than psychopharmaceuticals though that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine which is if you take your dog who is say compulsively chasing his tail into the veterinary behaviorist their first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad; it's to ask you about your dog's life They want to know how often your dog gets outside They want to know how much exercise your dog is getting They want to know how much social time with other dogs and other humans They want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies largely behavior therapies you've tried with that animal Those are the things that often tend to help the most especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals The thing though I believe that helps the most particularly with social animals is time with other social animals In many ways I feel like I became a service animal to my own dog and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants I don't know about you; I get a lot of Internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships I also think it's a huge part of Facebook the monkey that adopts the cat or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn or the cow that makes friends with the pig I would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged and what I can tell you now is that there is actually something to this This is legit In fact some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs or who enjoy each other's company and beyond that other studies show that oxytocin raised even in other pairs of animals so say in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other their levels spiked afterwards mental health is in fact a two-way street His name is Lonnie Hodge and he's a veteran of Vietnam When he returned he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of people who had gone through war trauma because in Vietnam he had been over the skids and he was givena service dog named Gander a labradoodle to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights This is them actually on the first day that they met which is amazing and since then they've spent a lot of time together visiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues But what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship is about a few months in What's pretty great about this though is that he's still a fantastic service dog because now when they're both at a great height Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself and it's changed me I no longer look at animals at the species level I look at them as individuals and I think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems guiding their behavior and informing how they respond to the world And I really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person both to the animals that share my bed and occasionally wind up on my plate but also to the people that I know who are suffering from anxiety and from phobias and all manner of other things and I really do believe that even though you can't know exactly what's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner that that shouldn't stop you from empathizing with them The best thing that we could do for our loved ones is perhaps to anthropomorphize them Charles Darwin's father once told him that everybody could lose their mind at some point Thankfully we can often find them again but only with each other's help Thank you When my first children's book was published in 2001 I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator and when I was setting up my slide projector in the cafetorium I looked across the room and there she was: my old lunch lady She was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day So I approached her to say hello and I said Hi Jeannie How are you And she looked at me and I could tell that she recognized me but she couldn't quite place me and she looked at me and she said Stephen Krosoczka And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka but Stephen is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid And she started telling me about her grandkids and that blew my mind My lunch lady had grandkids and therefore kids and therefore left school at the end of the day I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons I had never thought about any of that before Well that chance encounter inspired my imagination and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes a school bus monster and mutant mathletes and the end of every book they get the bad guy with their hairnet and they proclaim Justice is served And it's been amazing because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork And I would notice as I would visit schools the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way And coast to coast all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing: Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness Because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time But it meant the most to Jeannie When the books were first published I invited her to the book launch party and in front of everyone there everyone she had fed over the years I gave her a piece of artwork and some books And two years after this photo was taken she passed away and I attended her wake and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there because next to her casket was this painting and her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work I had validated what she did And that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country: School Lunch Hero Day a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff And I partnered with the School Nutrition Association and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray There is Ms Brenda in California who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that 67 percent of their students relied on those meals every day and they were going without food over the summer so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings 500 kids a day during the summer And kids made the most amazing projects I knew they would Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers And they made their own comics starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies And they made thank you pizzas where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza For me I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies because one woman said to me she said Before this day I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here Another woman said to me You know what I got out of this is that what I do is important And of course what she does is important What they all do is important They're feeding our children every single day and before a child can learn their belly needs to be full and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society So I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be A thank you can change a life It changes the life of the person who receives it and it changes the life of the person who expresses it Thank you I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach the Fez River Rehabilitation Project boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world called the medina nestled in a river valley The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site Since the 1950s as the population of the medina grew basic urban infrastructure quickly changed and got highly stressed One of the biggest casualties of the situation was the Fez River which bisects the medina in its middle and has been considered for many centuries as the city's very soul In fact one can witness the presence of the river's extensive water network Unfortunately because of the pollution of the river it has been covered little by little with the destruction of many houses enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina or trash yards Actually the state of the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy At some point I couldn't bear the desecration of the river such an important part of my city and I decided to take action especially after I heard that the city received a grant to divert sewage water to uncover the river However we were sneaky to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways back to the city fabric that are lacking in the Medina of Fez I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces The first one is the Rcif Plaza which sits actually right on top of the river which you can see here in dotted lines This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub of the medina that has the largest pedestrian network in the world right next to the plaza you can see that the river looked like a river of trash Instead what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian to cover it with recycled leather canopies The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks and it used to be an illegal parking and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina The playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland but also retains it when floods occur As the project progressed and received several design awards and focus on the main goals of the project: that is to uncover the river treat its water and provide public spaces for all We were actually very lucky and many of those goals happened Like you can see here in the Rcif Plaza This is how it looks like today It's still under construction by the local population And finally this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed This is the river covered used as a trash yard Then after many years of work the river with clean water uncovered And finally you can see here the river the role and the agency of the architect that is to transform the river from sewage to public space for all rather than a mummified heritage Thank you very much TED is 30 The world wide web is celebrating this month its 25th anniversary So I've got a question for you Let's talk about the journey mainly about the future Let's talk about the state Let's talk about what sort of a web we want So 25 years ago then I was working at CERN I got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project I wrote the code I was I suppose the first user There was a lot of concern that people didn't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated A lot of persuasion a lot of wonderful collaboration with other people and bit by bit it worked It took off It was pretty cool And in fact a few years later in 2000 five percent of the world population were using the world wide web In 2007 seven years later 17 percent In 2008 we formed the World Wide Web Foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure And now here we are in 2014 and 40 percent of the world are using the world wide web and counting Obviously it's increasing I want you to think about both sides of that Okay obviously to anybody here at TED the first question you ask is what can we do to get the other 60 percent on board as quickly as possible Lots of important things Obviously it's going to be around mobile But also I want you to think about the 40 percent because if you're sitting there yourself sort of with a web-enabled life you don't remember things anymore you just look them up then you may feel that it's been a success and we can all sit back But in fact yeah it's been a success there's lots of things Khan Academy for crying out loud there's Wikipedia there's a huge number of free e-books that you can read online lots of wonderful things for education things in many areas Online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether made types of commerce available which weren't available at all before Commerce has been almost universally affected Government not universally affected but very affected and on a good day lots of open data lots of e-government so lots of things which are visible happening on the web Also lots of things which are less visible The healthcare late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country Those sorts of things are not they're not out there and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy So we cannot assume that part of the web part of the deal with the web is when I use the web it's just a transparent neutral medium I can talk to you over it without worrying about what we in fact now know is happening without worrying about the fact that not only will surveillance be happening but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data So in fact something we realized we can't just use the web we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing is it in fact of a quality that we need We revel in the fact that we have this wonderful free speech We can tweet and oh lots and lots of people can see our tweets except when they can't except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves the state of the country we live in which isn't available to anybody else So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down that the web is opened up where there is censorship We love the fact that the web is open It allows us to talk Anybody can talk to anybody It doesn't matter who we are And then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos so that it's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves And we also have if you've read the book about the filter bubble the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like So we love it when we're bathed in what things we like to click on and so the machine automatically feeds us the stuff that we like and we end up with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world called a filter bubble So here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have What sort of web do you want I want one which is not fragmented into lots of pieces as some countries have been suggesting they should do in reaction to recent surveillance I want a web which has got for example is a really good basis for democracy I want a web where I can use healthcare with privacy and where there's a lot of health data clinical data is available to scientists to do research I want a web where the other 60 percent get on board as fast as possible I want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens some disaster strikes that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly So this is just some of the things that I want from a big list obviously it's longer You have your list I want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want You can go to webat25。org and find some links There are lots of sites where people have started to put together a Magna Carta a bill of rights for the web How about we do that How about we decide these are in a way becoming fundamental rights the right to communicate with whom I want What would be on your list for that Magna Carta Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta for the web Let's do that this year Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary to crowdsource a Magna Carta to the web Thank you And do me a favor will you Fight for it for me Okay Thanks Dr Martin Luther King Jr。 in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement states In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends As a teacher I've internalized this message Every day all around us we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination violence genocide and war In the classroom I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry We work together to fill those spaces to recognize them to name them to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class which every student signs at the beginning of the year: read critically write consciously speak clearly tell your truth And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point tell your truth And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so So I tell them that growing up as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity I've given up soda McDonald's French fries French kisses and everything in between But one year I gave up speaking I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything appeasing ignorance with my silence unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence When Christian was beat up for being gay I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice I couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing I was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one When the woman at the fundraising gala said I'm so proud of you It must be so hard teaching those poor unintelligent kids I bit my lip because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't Silence is the residue of fear It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left It is the sound after the noose is already tied It is charring It is chains It is privilege It is pain There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision I will tell Christian that he is a lion a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was because sometimes all people want to be is human transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau and just because you watched one episode of The Wire doesn't mean you know anything about my kids So this year instead of giving something up I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue a stage on the underside of my inhibition Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice Thank you I'm a teacher and a practitioner of civics in America Now I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep to please wake up Why is it that the very word civics has such a soporific even a narcoleptic effect on us I think it's because the very word signifies something exceedingly virtuous exceedingly important and exceedingly boring Well I think it's the responsibility of people like us people who show up for gatherings like this in person or online in any way we can to make civics sexy again as sexy as it was during the American Revolution as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement And I believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of power The way we do that I believe is at the level of the city This is what I want to talk about today and I want to start by defining some terms and then I want to describe the scale of the problem I think we face and then suggest the ways that I believe cities can be the seat of the solution So let me start with some definitions By civics I simply mean the art of being a pro-social problem-solving contributor in a self-governing community Civics is the art of citizenship what Bill Gates Sr calls simply showing up for life and it encompasses three things: a foundation of values and a set of skills that allow you to pursue goals and to have others join in that pursuit And that brings me to my definition of power which is simply this: the capacity to make others do what you would have them do It sounds menacing doesn't it We don't like to talk about power We find it scary We find it somehow evil We feel uncomfortable naming it In the culture and mythology of democracy power resides with the people Period End of story Any further inquiry not necessary and not really that welcome Power has a negative moral valence It sounds Machiavellian inherently It seems inherently evil But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics It just is And power governs how any form of government operates whether a democracy or a dictatorship And the problem we face today here in America in particular but all around the world is that far too many people are profoundly illiterate in power what it is who has it how it operates how it flows what part of it is visible what part of it is not why some people have it why that's compounded And as a result of this illiteracy those few who do understand how power operates in civic life those who understand how a bill becomes a law yes but also how a friendship becomes a subsidy or how a bias becomes a policy or how a slogan becomes a movement the people who understand those things wield disproportionate influence and they're perfectly happy of the great majority to grab hold of this idea of power and to democratize it One of the things that is so profoundly exciting and challenging about this moment is that as a result of this power illiteracy there is a concentration of knowledge of understanding of clout I mean think about it: How does a friendship become a subsidy Seamlessly when a senior government official decides to leave government and become a lobbyist for a private interest for their new masters How does a bias become a policy Insidiously just the way that stop-and-frisk for instance became over time a bureaucratic numbers game How does a slogan become a movement Virally in the way that the Tea Party for instance was able to take the Don't Tread on Me flag from the American Revolution or how on the other side a band of activists could take a magazine headline Occupy Wall Street and turn that into a global meme and movement aren't looking for and don't want to see these realities So much of this ignorance this civic illiteracy is willful There are some millennials for instance who think the whole business is just sordid They don't want to have anything to do with politics They'd rather just opt out and engage in volunteerism who believe that the cure-all for any power imbalance or power abuse is simply more data more transparency There are some on the left who think power resides only with corporations and some on the right who think power resides only with government each side blinded by their selective outrage There are the naive who believe that good things just happen and the cynical who believe that bad things just happen the fortunate and unfortunate unlike rather than the eminently alterable result of a prior arrangement an inherited allocation of power we here particularly in America today have depressingly low levels of civic knowledge civic engagement participation awareness The whole business of politics has been effectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals message people research people The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs in the sense of suckers We become demotivated to learn more about how things work We begin to opt out Well this problem this challenge is a thing that we must now confront and I believe that when you have this kind of disengagement this willful ignorance it becomes both a cause and a consequence of this concentration of opportunity of wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago this profound civic inequality This is why it is so important in our time right now to reimagine civics as the teaching of power Perhaps it's never been more important at any time in our lifetimes If people don't learn power if people don't wake up and if they don't wake up they get left out Now part of the art of practicing power means being awake and having a voice but it also is about having an arena where you can plausibly practice deciding All of civics boils down to the simple question of who decides and you have to play that out And this brings me to the third point that I want to make today which is simply that there is no better arena in our time for the practicing of power than the city Think about the city where you live where you're from Think about a problem in the common life of your city It can be something small like where a street lamp should go or something medium like which library should have its hours extended or cut or maybe something bigger like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be turned into a highway or a greenway or whether all the businesses in your town should be required to pay a living wage Think about the change that you want in your city and then think about how you would get it how you would make it happen Take an inventory of all the forms of power that are at play in your city's situation: money of course people yes ideas information misinformation the threat of force the force of norms All of these form of power are at play Now think about how you would activate or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power This is not some Game of Thrones empire-level set of questions These are questions that play out in every single place on the planet I'll just tell you quickly about two stories drawn from recent headlines In Boulder Colorado voters not too long ago approved a process to replace the private power company literally the power company the electric company Xcel with a publicly owned utility that would forego profits and attend far more to climate change Well Xcel fought back and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure that would undermine or undo this municipalization And so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this now literally have to fight the power in order to fight for power In Tuscaloosa at the University of Alabama there's an organization on campus called kind of menacingly the Machine and it draws from largely white sororities and for decades the Machine has dominated student government elections Well now recently the Machine and they've engineered the election of a former Machine member a young pro-business recent graduate to the Tuscaloosa city school board Now as I say these are just two examples drawn almost at random from the headlines Every day there are thousands more like them And you may like or dislike the efforts I'm describing here in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa but you cannot help but admire their skill of the elemental questions of civic power what objective what strategy what tactics what is the terrain who are your enemies Now I want you to return or that challenge in your city and the thing it was that you want to fix and ask yourself do you have command of these elemental questions of power Could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know This is the challenge and the opportunity for us We live in a time right now or perhaps because of globalization all citizenship is ever more resonantly powerfully local Indeed power in our time is flowing ever faster to the city Here in the United States the national government Civic imagination and innovation and creativity of localism that's now arriving and you see it in how people eat and work and share and buy and move and live their everyday lives this isn't some precious parochialism this isn't some retreat into insularity no This is emergent The localism of our time is networked powerfully And so for instance consider the ways that strategies for making cities more bike-friendly have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle Think about how experiments in participatory budgeting where everyday citizens get a chance to allocate and decide upon the allocation of city funds Those experiments have spread from Porto Alegre Brazil to here in New York City to the wards of Chicago Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles and many cities between what a day without immigrants would look like In China all across that country members of the New Citizens' Movement are beginning to activate and organize to fight official corruption and graft and they're drawing the ire of officials there but they're also drawing the attention of anti-corruption activists all around the world In Seattle where I'm from we've become part of a great global array of cities that are now working together bypassing government altogether national government altogether in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals of the Kyoto Protocol All of these citizens united are forming a web a great archipelago of power that allows us to bypass brokenness and monopolies of control And our task now is to accelerate this work Our task now is to bring more and more people into the fold of this work That's why my organization Citizen University to create an everyman's curriculum in civic power And this curriculum starts with this triad that I described earlier of values systems and skills And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you to help create this curriculum with the stories and the experiences and the challenges that each of you lives and faces to create something powerfully collective And I want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn from the early frameworks of this curriculum I want you to write a narrative a narrative from the future of your city and you can date it set it out one year from now five years from now a decade from now a generation from now and write it as a case study looking back looking back at the change that you wanted in your city looking back at the cause that you were championing and describing the ways that that change and that cause came in fact to succeed Describe the values of your fellow citizens that you activated and the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir Recount all the different ways that you engaged the systems of government of the marketplace of social institutions of faith organizations of the media Catalog all the skills you had to deploy how to negotiate how to advocate how to frame issues how to navigate diversity in conflict all those skills that enabled you to bring folks on board and to overcome resistance What you'll be doing when you write that narrative is you'll be discovering how to read power and in the process how to write power So share what you write do you what you write and then share what you do I invite you to literally share the narratives that you create on our Facebook page for Citizen University But even beyond that it's in the conversations that we have today all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings that are happening on this topic at this moment and to think about how we can become one another's teachers and students in power If we do that then together we can make civics sexy again Together we can democratize democracy and make it safe again for amateurs Together we can create a great network of city that will be the most powerful collective laboratory for self-government this planet has ever seen We have the power to do that Thank you very much We're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay We get the people for whom nothing else has worked people who have fallen through all of the other social safety nets They can't contain them so we must That's our job: contain them control them Over the years as a prison system as a nation and as a society we've become very good at that but that shouldn't make you happy Today we incarcerate more people per capita than any other country in the world We have more black men in prison today than were under slavery in 1850 We house the parents of almost three million of our community's children and we've become the new asylum the largest mental health provider in this nation When we lock someone up that is no small thing And yet we are called the Department of Corrections Today I want to talk about changing the way we think about corrections I believe and my experience tells me that when we change the way we think we create new possibilities or futures and prisons need a different future I've spent my entire career in corrections over 30 years I followed my dad into this field He was a Vietnam veteran Corrections suited him He was strong steady disciplined I was not so much any of those things and I'm sure that worried him about me Eventually I decided if I was going to end up in prison I'd better end up on the right side of the bars so I thought I'd check it out take a tour of the place my dad worked the McNeil Island Penitentiary Now this was the early '80s and prisons weren't quite what you see on TV or in the movies In many ways it was worse I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high There were eight men to a cell there were 550 men in that living unit And just in case you wondered they shared one toilet in those small confines An officer put a key in a lockbox and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells I walked away as fast as I could Eventually I went back and I started as an officer there My job was to run one of those cell blocks and to control those hundreds of men When I went to work at our receptions center I could actually hear the inmates roiling from the parking lot shaking cell doors yelling tearing up their cells Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up and what you get is chaos Contain and control that was our job One way we learned to do this more effectively was a new type of housing unit called the Intensive Management Unit IMU a modern version of a hole We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors with cuff ports so we could restrain them and feed them Guess what It got quieter Disturbances died down in the general population Places became safer because those inmates who were most violent or disruptive could now be isolated But isolation isn't good Deprive people of social contact and they deteriorate It was hard getting them out of IMU for them and for us Even in prison it's no small thing to lock someone up My next assignment was to one of the state's deep-end prisons where some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed By then the industry had advanced a lot and we had different tools and techniques to manage disruptive behavior We had beanbag guns and pepper spray and plexiglass shields flash bangs emergency response teams We met violence with force and chaos with chaos We were pretty good at putting out fires While I was there I met two experienced correctional workers who were also researchers an anthropologist and a sociologist One day one of them commented to me and said You know you're pretty good at putting out fires Have you ever thought about how to prevent them I was patient with them explaining our brute force approach to making prisons safer They were patient with me Out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments First we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy Instead of four weeks of training we gave them 10 Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model where we paired new staff with veteran staff They both got better at the work Second we added verbal de-escalation skills into the training continuum and made it part of the use of force continuum It was the non-force use of force And then we did something even more radical We trained the inmates on those same skills We changed the skill set reducing violence not just responding to it Third when we expanded our facility we tried a new type of design Now the biggest and most controversial component of this design of course was the toilet There were no toilets Now that might not sound significant to you here today but at the time it was huge No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet We all thought it was dangerous and crazy Even eight men to a cell had a toilet That small detail changed the way we worked Inmates and staff started interacting more often and openly and developing a rapport It was easier to detect conflict and intervene before it escalated The unit was cleaner quieter safer and more humane This was more effective at keeping the peace than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point Interacting changes the way you behave both for the officer and the inmate We changed the environment and we changed the behavior Now just in case I hadn't learned this lesson they assigned me to headquarters next and that's where I ran straight up against system change Now many things work against system change: politics and politicians bills and laws courts and lawsuits internal politics System change is difficult and slow and oftentimes it doesn't take you where you want to go It's no small thing to change a prison system So what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences and I remembered that when we interacted with offenders the heat went down When we changed the environment the behavior changed And these were not huge system changes These were small changes and these changes created new possibilities So next I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison And at the same time I was working on my degree at the Evergreen State College I interacted with a lot of people who were not like me people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds One of them was a rainforest ecologist She looked at my small prison and what she saw was a laboratory We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates could actually help advance science by helping them complete projects they couldn't complete on their own like repopulating endangered species: frogs butterflies endangered prairie plants At the same time we found ways to make our operation more efficient through the addition of solar power rainwater catchment organic gardening recycling This initiative has led to many projects that have had huge system-wide impact not just in our system but in other state systems as well small experiments making a big difference to science to the community The way we think about our work changes our work The project just made my job more interesting and exciting I was excited Staff were excited Officers were excited Inmates were excited They were inspired Everybody wanted to be part of this They were making a contribution a difference one they thought was meaningful and important Let me be clear on what's going on here though Inmates are highly adaptive They have to be Oftentimes they know more about our own systems than the people who run them And they're here for a reason I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them but I do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison So that was the question: Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives and if so what difference would that make So I took that question back to the deep end where some of our most violent offenders are housed Remember IMUs are for punishment You don't get perks there like programming That was how we thought But then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming it was these particular inmates In fact they needed intensive programming So we changed our thinking 180 degrees and we started looking for new possibilities What we found was a new kind of chair Instead of using the chair for punishment we put it in classrooms Okay we didn't forget our responsibility to control but now inmates could interact safely face-to-face with other inmates and staff and because control was no longer an issue everybody could focus on other things like learning Behavior changed We changed our thinking and we changed what was possible and this gives me hope Now I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work What I can tell you though it is working Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates and when our prisons are safe we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal but it's not our only goal To be honest with you preventing crime takes so much more from so many more people and institutions If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime I'm afraid we'll never get there But prisons can do some things we never thought they could do Prisons can be the source of innovation and sustainability repopulating endangered species and environmental restoration Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers dog rescuers Prisons can be the source of meaningful work and opportunity for staff and the inmates who live there We can contain and control and provide humane environments These are not opposing qualities We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out if this is worth doing Our strategy is not massive system change Our strategy is hundreds of small changes that take place in days or months not years We need more small pilots where we learn as we go pilots that change the range of possibility We need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement on interaction on safe environments We need more opportunities to participate in and contribute to our communities your communities We can do that Prisons need to provide humane environments where people can participate contribute and learn meaningful lives We're learning how to do that That's why I'm hopeful We don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison We can define that We can create that And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity prisons can be more than the bucket for failed social policy Maybe finally we will earn our title: a department of corrections Thank you You probably don't know me but I am one of those 。01 percenters that you hear about and read about and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat And tonight what I would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats to my people because it feels like it's time for us all to have a chat Like most plutocrats I too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist I have founded cofounded or funded over 30 companies across a range of industries I was the first non-family investor in Amazon。com that we sold to Microsoft for 6。4 billion dollars My friends and I we own a bank I tell you this unbelievable right I tell you this to show that my life is like most plutocrats I have a broad perspective on capitalism and business and I have been rewarded obscenely for that with a life that most of you all can't even imagine: multiple homes a yacht my own plane etc。 etc。 etc But let's be honest: I am not the smartest person you've ever met I am certainly not the hardest working I was a mediocre student I'm not technical at all I can't write a word of code Truly my success is the consequence of spectacular luck of birth of circumstance and of timing But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things One I have an unusually high tolerance for risk and the other is I have a good sense a good intuition about what will happen in the future and I think that that intuition about the future is the essence of good entrepreneurship So what do I see in our future today you ask I see pitchforks as in angry mobs with pitchforks because while people like us plutocrats are living beyond the dreams of avarice the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind In 1980 the top one percent of Americans shared about eight percent of national income while the bottom 50 percent of Americans shared 18 percent Thirty years later today the top one percent shares over 20 percent of national income while the bottom 50 percent of Americans share 12 or 13 If the trend continues the top one percent will share over 30 percent of national income in another 30 years while the bottom 50 percent of Americans will share just six You see the problem isn't that we have some inequality Some inequality is necessary for a high-functioning capitalist democracy The problem is that inequality is at historic highs today and it's getting worse every day And if wealth power and income continue to concentrate at the very tippy top our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a neo-feudalist rentier society like 18th-century France That was France before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world: Wake up Wake up It cannot last Because if we do not do something to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society the pitchforks will come for us for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality It has never happened There are no examples You show me a highly unequal society and I will show you a police state or an uprising The pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this It's not a matter of if it's when And it will be terrible when they come for everyone but particularly for people like us plutocrats I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder I'm not I'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately self-defeating Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks from pitchforks but it's also terrible for business too So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford When Ford famously introduced the $5 day which was twice the prevailing wage at the time he didn't just increase the productivity of his factories he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made Ford intuited what we now know is true that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem a feedback loop between customers and businesses Raising wages increases demand which increases hiring which in turn increases wages and demand and profits and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity is precisely what is missing from today's economic recovery And this is why we need to put behind us the trickle-down policies that so dominate both political parties and embrace something I call middle-out economics Middle-out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient linear mechanistic that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness and instead embraces the 21st-century idea that economies are complex adaptive ecosystemic that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality that they're not efficient at all but are effective if well managed This 21st-century perspective allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work by efficiently allocating existing resources It works by efficiently creating new solutions to human problems The genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system It rewards people for solving other people's problems The difference between a poor society and a rich society obviously is the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens The sum of the solutions that we have in our society really is our prosperity and this explains why companies like Google and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple and the entrepreneurs who created those companies have contributed so much to our nation's prosperity This 21st-century perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems But that rate is totally dependent upon how many problem solvers diverse able problem solvers we have and thus how many of our fellow citizens actively participate both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions and as customers who consume them But this maximizing participation thing doesn't happen by accident It doesn't happen by itself It requires effort and investment which is why all highly prosperous capitalist democracies are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure that they depend on We plutocrats need to get this trickle-down economics thing behind us this idea that the better we do the better everyone else will do It's not true How could it be I earn 1，000 times the median wage but I do not buy 1，000 times as much stuff do I I actually bought two pairs of these pants what my partner Mike calls my manager pants I could have bought 2，000 pairs but what would I do with them How many haircuts can I get How often can I go out to dinner No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get we can never drive a great national economy Only a thriving middle class can do that There's nothing to be done my plutocrat friends might say Henry Ford was in a different time Maybe we can't do some things Maybe we can do some things June 19 2013 Bloomberg published an article I wrote called The Capitalist's Case for a $15 Minimum Wage The good people at Forbes magazine among my biggest admirers called it Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal And yet just 350 days after that article was published Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle to 15 dollars an hour more than double what the prevailing federal $7。25 rate is How did this happen reasonable people might ask It happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies We reminded them that when workers have more money businesses have more customers and need more employees We reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need We reminded them that low-wage workers make terrible taxpayers and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses all businesses benefit yet all can compete Now the orthodox reaction of course is raising the minimum wage costs jobs Right Your politician's always echoing that trickle-down idea by saying things like Well if you raise the price of employment guess what happens You get less of it Are you sure Because there's some contravening evidence Since 1980 the wages of CEOs in our country have gone from about 30 times the median wage to 500 times That's raising the price of employment And yet to my knowledge I have never seen a company outsource its CEO's job automate their job export the job to China In fact we appear to be employing more CEOs and senior managers than ever before So too for technology workers and financial services workers who earn multiples of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them so clearly you can raise the price of employment and get more of it I know that most people think that the $15 minimum wage is this insane risky economic experiment We disagree We believe that the $15 minimum wage in Seattle is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy It is allowing our city to kick your city's ass Because you see Washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation We pay all workers $9。32 which is almost 30 percent more than the federal minimum of 7。25 but crucially 427 percent more than the federal tipped minimum of 2。13 If trickle-down thinkers were right then Washington state should have massive unemployment Seattle should be sliding into the ocean And yet Seattle is the fastest-growing big city in the country Washington state is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation The restaurant business in Seattle Booming Why Because the fundamental law of capitalism is when workers have more money businesses have more customers and need more workers When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants that's not bad for the restaurant business That's good for it despite what some restaurateurs may tell you Is it more complicated than I'm making out Of course it is There are a lot of dynamics at play But can we please stop insisting that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse There is no evidence for it The most insidious thing about trickle-down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer everyone is better off It is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer that will be bad for the economy This is nonsense So can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me and my plutocrat friends made our country We plutocrats know even if we don't like to admit it in public that if we had been born somewhere else not here in the United States we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit It's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places even very very poor places It's just that that's all that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford So here's an idea for a new kind of economics a new kind of politics that I call new capitalism Let's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives but also that the more people we include both as entrepreneurs and as customers the better it works Let's by all means shrink the size of government but not by slashing the poverty programs but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don't need those programs Let's invest enough in the middle class to make our economy fairer and more inclusive and by fairer more truly competitive and by more truly competitive more able to generate the solutions to human problems that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity Capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for creating prosperity in human societies if it is well managed but capitalism because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems tends towards inexorably inequality concentration and collapse The work of democracies is to maximize the inclusion of the many in order to create prosperity not to enable the few to accumulate money Government does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive Balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism It's essential to it Programs like a reasonable minimum wage affordable healthcare paid sick leave and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure necessary for the middle class like education R and D these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace to drive growth because no one benefits from it like us Many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science I disagree and I think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status and power which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories to tell everyone else about why our relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone: like we are indispensable the job creators and you are not; like tax cuts for us create growth but investments in you will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country; that we matter; that you don't For thousands of years these stories were called divine right Today we have trickle-down economics How obviously transparently self-serving all of this is We plutocrats need to see that the United States of America made us not the other way around; that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies not a consequence of it And we should never forget that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit Fellow plutocrats I think it may be time for us to recommit to our country to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective a capitalism that will ensure that America's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world Let's secure the future for ourselves our children and their children Or alternatively we could do nothing hide in our gated communities and private schools enjoy our planes and yachts they're fun and wait for the pitchforks Thank you As a kid I always loved information that I could get from data and the stories that could be told with numbers I remember growing up I'd be frustrated at how my own parents would lie to me using numbers Talithia if I've told you once I've told you a thousand times No dad you've only told me 17 times and twice it wasn't my fault I always wanted to know what are people trying to hide with numbers As a statistician I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself Donald and I were pregnant with our third child what some of you may refer to as being overdue Statisticians we call that being within the 95 percent confidence interval And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby and this is just routine it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress And you are rarely if ever seen by your actual doctor just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes the doctor comes out and he says Your baby is under stress we need to induce you Now as a statistician what's my response Show me the data So then he proceeds to tell us the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone my heart rate zone and I said Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate I was moving around a little bit it's hard to lay still on your back 41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes Maybe it was shifting around He said Well we don't want to take any chances I said okay I said What if I was at 36 weeks Would your decision be to induce Well no I would wait until you were at least 38 weeks but you are almost 42 there is no reason to leave that baby inside let's get you a room I said Well why don't we just do it again We can collect more data I can try to be really still for 20 minutes We can average the two and see what that means And he goes Ma'am I just don't want you to have a miscarriage That makes three of us And then he says Your chances of having a miscarriage double when you go past your due date Let's get you a room Wow So now as a statistician what's my response Show me the data Dude you're talking chances I do chances all day long tell me all about chances Let's talk chances Let's talk chances So I say Okay great Do I go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance Where are we here with this miscarriage thing And he goes Not quite but it doubles and we really just want what's best for the baby Undaunted I try a different angle I said Okay out of 1，000 full-term pregnant women how many of them are going to miscarry just before their due date And then he looks at me and looks at Donald and he goes about one in 1，000 I said Okay so of those 1，000 women how many are going to miscarry just after their due date About two I said Okay so you are telling me that my chances go from a 0。1-percent chance to a 0。2-percent chance Okay so at this point the data is not convincing us that we need to be induced about how inductions lead to a higher rate of Cesarean sections and if at all possible we'd like to avoid that And then I said And I really don't think my due date is accurate And so this really stunned him and he looked sort of puzzled and I said You may not know this but pregnancy due dates are calculated assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle and my cycle ranges And so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced We actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors because even with our first child we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low I'm not anti-medical intervention But why were confident to leave that day Well we had data that told a different story We had been collecting data for six years I had this temperature data and it told a different story In fact we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception at your kid's wedding reception I remember like it was yesterday My temperature was a sizzling 97。8 degrees as I stared into your father's eyes Oh yeah Twenty-two more years we're telling that story But we were confident to leave because we had been collecting data Now what does that data look like Here's a standard chart of a woman's waking body temperature during the course of a cycle So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next You'll see that the temperature is not random Clearly there is a low pattern at the beginning of her cycle and then you see this jump and then a higher set of temperatures at the end of her cycle So what's happening here What is that data telling you Well ladies at the beginning of our cycle the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen causes a suppression of your body temperature And at ovulation your body releases an egg and progesterone takes over pro-gestation And so your body heats up in anticipation of housing this new little fertilized egg So why this temperature jump Well think about when a bird sits on her eggs Why is she sitting on them She wants to keep them warm protect them and keep them warm Ladies this is exactly what our bodies do every month they heat up in anticipation of keeping a new little life warm And if nothing happens if you are not pregnant then estrogen takes back over and that cycle starts all over again But if you do get pregnant sometimes you actually see another shift in your temperatures and it stays elevated for those whole nine months because their temperatures are high Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago We were really very excited about this chart You'll see the low temperature level and then a shift and for about five days that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube and implant and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit And in fact we had a second temperature shift confirmed with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant with our first child very exciting Until a couple of days later I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage Had I not been taking my temperature but we actually had data to show that we had miscarried this baby and even though this data revealed a really unfortunate event in our lives I had data to show: Look we got pregnant our temperature shifted we somehow lost this baby What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem And it's not just about temperatures and it's not just about fertility; we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things For instance did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot about the condition of your thyroid So your thyroid works a lot like the thermostat in your house There is an optimal temperature that you want in your house; you set your thermostat When it gets too cold in the house your thermostat kicks in and says Hey we need to blow some heat around Or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers Turn the A。C on Cool us off Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature for your body If it gets too cold your thyroid says Hey we need to heat up If it gets too hot your thyroid cools you down But what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well When it doesn't function then it shows up in your body temperatures And so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid Now what is it if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood Fine But the problem with that test is So you might have a lot of hormone present but it might not be actively working to regulate your body temperature So just by collecting your temperature every day you get information about the condition of your thyroid So what if you don't want to take your temperature every day I advocate that you do but there are tons of other things you could take You could take your blood pressure you could take your weight yeah who's excited about taking their weight every day Early on in our marriage Donald had a stuffy nose and he had been taking a slew of medications to try to relieve his stuffy nose to no avail And so that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says Honey I can't breath out of my nose And I roll over and I look and I said Well can you breath out of your mouth And he goes Yes but I can't breath out of my nose And so like any good wife I rush him to the emergency room at 2 o'clock in the morning And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking you can't die on me now We just got married people will think I killed you And so we get to the emergency room and the nurse sees us and he can't breath out of his nose and so she brings us to the back and the doctor says What seems to be the problem and he goes I can't breath out of my nose And he said You can't breath out of your nose No but he can breath out of his mouth He takes a step back and he looks at both of us and he says Sir I think I know the problem You're having a heart attack I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan no no no It's not a heart attack He can breathe just out of his mouth No no no no no And so we go back and forth with this doctor because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis and he's like No really it'll be fine just calm down And I'm thinking how do you calm down But I don't think he's having a heart attack And so fortunately for us this doctor was at the end of the shift So this new doctor comes in he sees us clearly distraught with a husband who can't breath out of his nose And he starts asking us questions He says Well do you two exercise We ride our bikes we go to the gym occasionally We move around And he says What were you doing just before you came here I'm thinking I was sleeping honestly But okay what was Donald doing just before So Donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking He lists I took this decongestant and then I took this nasal spray and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says Oh You should never mix this decongestant with this nasal spray Clogs you up every time Here take this one instead He gives us a prescription We're looking at each other and I looked at the doctor and I said Why is it that it seems like you were able to accurately diagnose his condition but this previous doctor wanted to order an EKG and a CAT scan And he looks at us and says Well when a 350-pound man walks in the emergency room and says he can't breath you assume he's having a heart attack and you ask questions later but not always accurately And so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him I want you to consider the following chart of systolic blood pressure measurements from October 2010 to July 2012 in the prehypertension/hypertension zone they move into the normal zone This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old What story is this data telling you Obviously it's the data from someone who's made a drastic transformation and fortunately for us that person happens to be here today So that 350-pound guy that walked into the emergency room with me is now an even sexier and healthier 225-pound guy and that's his blood pressure trace So over the course of that year and a half Donald's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed and his heart rate responded his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body So what's the take-home message that I want you to leave with today By taking ownership of your data just like we've done just by taking this daily measurements about yourself you become the expert on your body You become the authority It's not hard to do You don't have to have a Ph。D in statistics to be an expert in yourself You don't have to have a medical degree to be your body's expert Medical doctors they're experts on the population but you are the expert on yourself And so when two of you come together when two experts come together the two of you are able to make a better decision than just your doctor alone Now that you understand the power of information that you can get through personal data collection Yes get it up I challenge you to take ownership of your data And today I hereby confer upon you a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto And so the next time you are in your doctor's office as newly inducted statisticians what should always be your response Audience: Show me the data Talithia Williams: I can't hear you Audience: Show me the data TW: One more time Audience: Show me the data TW: Show me the data Thank you I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing But when I was told that the topic was language I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment I have a problem It's not the worst thing in the world I'm fine I'm not on fire I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with but for me language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing And the thing is that I have a stutter It might seem curious given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here speaking to you guys But the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point and including this point living in mortal dread of public speaking Public singing whole different thing But we'll get to that in a moment I've never really talked about it before so explicitly I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown-up I wouldn't have one I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown I'll have learned to speak French and when I'm grown I'll learn how to manage my money and when I'm grown I won't have a stutter and then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and you know So I can talk about it now because I've reached this point where I mean I'm 28 I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer with a speech impediment So I might as well come clean about it There are some interesting angles to having a stutter For me the worst thing that can happen is meeting another stutterer This happened to me in Hamburg when this guy we met and he said and I said Oh hello m-m-m-my name is Meg Imagine my horror when I realized he thought I was making fun of him People think I'm drunk all the time People think that I've forgotten their name when I hesitate before saying it And it is a very weird thing because proper nouns are the worst If I'm going to use the word Wednesday in a sentence and I'm coming up to the word and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something I can change the word to tomorrow or the day after Tuesday or something else It's clunky but you can get away with it because over time I've developed this loophole method of using speech where right at the last minute you change the thing and you trick your brain But with people's names you can't change them When I was singing a lot of jazz I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve As you can probably gather S's and T's together or independently are my kryptonite But I would have to introduce the band over this rolling vamp and when I got around to Steve I'd often find myself stuck on the St And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable and it totally kills the vibe So after a few instances of this Steve happily became Seve and we got through it that way I've had a lot of therapy and a common form of treatment is to use this technique that's called smooth speech which is where you almost sing everything that you say You kind of join everything together in this very singsong kindergarten teacher way and it makes you sound very serene like you've had lots of Valium and everything is calm That's not actually me And I do use that I do I use it when I have to be on panel shows or when I have to do radio interviews when the economy of airtime is paramount I get through it that way for my job But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real that feels often like cheating Which is why before I sing I wanted to tell you what singing means to me It's more than making nice sounds and it's more than making nice songs It's more than feeling known or understood It's more than making you feel the things that I feel It's not about mythology or mythologizing myself to you Somehow through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain it's impossible to stutter when you sing And when I was younger that was a method of treatment that worked very well for me singing so I did it a lot And that's why I'm here today Thank you Singing for me is sweet relief It is the only time when I feel fluent It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended So I know that this is a TED Talk but now i'm going to TED sing This is a song that I wrote last year Thank you very much Thank you I would be a beauty but my nose is slightly too big for my face And I would be a dreamer but my dream is slightly too big for this space And I would be an angel but my halo it pales in the glow of your grace And I would be a joker but that card looks silly when you play your ace I'd like to know Are there stars in hell And I'd like to know know if you can tell that you make me lose everything I know That I cannot choose to or not let go And I'd stay forever but my home is slightly too far from this place And I swear I tried to slow it down when I am walking at your pace But all I could think idling through the cities do I look pretty in the rain And I don't know how someone quite so lovely makes me feel ugly So much shame And I'd like to know Are there stars in hell And I'd like to know know if you can tell that you make me lose everything I know that I cannot choose to or not let go Thank you very much What do you think of when I say the word design You probably think of things like this or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things classic icons of timeless design But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design I want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket I'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend Consider the fact that Google processes over one billion search queries every day that every minute over 100 hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube That's more in a single day than all three major U。S networks broadcast in the last five years combined And Facebook transmitting the photos messages and stories of over 1。23 billion people That's almost half of the Internet population and a sixth of humanity These are some of the products that I've helped design over the course of my career and their scale is so massive that they've produced unprecedented design challenges But what is really hard about designing at scale is this: It's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things audacity and humility audacity to believe that the thing that you're making is something that the entire world wants and needs and humility to understand that as a designer it's not about you or your portfolio it's about the people that you're designing for and how your work just might help them live better lives Now unfortunately there's no school that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101 I and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale and today I'd like share some of the things that we've learned over the years Now the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter Here's a really good example of how a very tiny design element can make a big impact The team at Facebook that manages the Facebook Like button decided that it needed to be redesigned with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized Now you might think well it's a tiny little button it probably is a pretty straightforward easy design assignment but it wasn't Turns out there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button You had to work within specific height and width parameters You had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages and be careful about using fancy gradients or borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers The truth is designing this tiny little button was a huge pain in the butt Now this is the new version of the button and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over 280 hours redesigning this button over the course of months Now why would we spend so much time on something so small It's because when you're designing at scale there's no such thing as a small detail This innocent little button is seen on average 22 billion times a day and on over 7。5 million websites It's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it but with these kinds of products you need to get even the tiny things right Now the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data Now when you're working on products like this you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions but it's not just as simple as following the numbers Let me give you an example so that you can understand what I mean Facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards things like spam and abuse And there were a ton of photos reported but as it turns out only a small percentage were actually in violation of those community standards Most of them were just your typical party photo Now to give you a specific hypothetical example let's say my friend Laura hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke This is purely hypothetical I can assure you Now incidentally you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on Facebook Do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at Facebook So anyway there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch He really thought there was something else going on and he was right because when he looked through a bunch of the cases he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves Now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before So they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down But it didn't work Only 20 percent of people sent the message to their friend So the team went back at it They consulted with experts in conflict resolution They even studied the universal principles of polite language which I didn't even actually know existed until this research happened And they found something really interesting They had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down They had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel Here's how the experience works today So I find this hypothetical photo of myself and it's not spam it's not abuse but I really wish it weren't on the site So I report it and I say I'm in this photo and I don't like it and then we dig deeper Why don't you like this photo of yourself And I select It's embarrassing And then I'm encouraged to message my friend but here's the critical difference I'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to Laura how the photo makes me feel Now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact Before only 20 percent of people were sending the message and now 60 percent were and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result That same survey showed that 90 percent of your friends want to know if they've done something to upset you Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are but maybe that's where our Unfriend feature can come in handy So as you can see these decisions are highly nuanced Of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions but we also rely very heavily on iteration research testing intuition human empathy It's both art and science Now sometimes the designers who work on these products are called data-driven which is a term that totally drives us bonkers The fact is it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right but data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition Data can help you make a good design great but it will never made a bad design good The next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change you need to do it extraordinarily carefully Now I often have joked that I spend almost as much time designing the introduction of change as I do the change itself and I'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust The fact is people can become very efficient at using bad design and so even if the change is good for them in the long run it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens and this is particularly true with user-generated content platforms because people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership It is after all their content Now years ago when I was working at YouTube we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos and it was interesting because when we looked into the data we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five-star rating a handful of people were using the lowest one-star and virtually no one was using two three or four stars So we decided to simplify into an up-down kind of voting binary model It's going to be much easier for people to engage with But people were very attached to the five-star rating system Video creators really loved their ratings Millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design So in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design more quickly we actually published the data graph sharing with the community and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation which resulted in my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time: YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization: Its Ratings Are Useless Now it's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you're making changes to products that so many people use Even though we tried to do all the right things we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff really really matters to them Now we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process and we have to introduce change very very carefully Now these things are all really useful But they don't mean anything if you don't understand something much more fundamental You have to understand who you are designing for Now when you set a goal to design for the entire human race and you start to engage in that goal in earnest at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you're living in Now in San Francisco we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone to the new hipster coffee shop But what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity What if you had no access to public libraries What if your country had no free press What would these products start to mean to you This is what Google YouTube and Facebook look like to most of the world and it's what they'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online Designing for low-end cell phones is not glamorous design work but if you want to design for the whole world you have to design for where people are and not where you are So how do we keep this big big picture in mind We try to travel outside of our bubble to see hear and understand the people we're designing for We use our products in non-English languages to make sure that they work just as well And we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality So what does it mean to design at a global scale It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products Finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting and the humility part it's a little tough on the design ego Because these products are always changing everything that I've designed in my career is pretty much gone and everything that I will design will fade away But here's what remains: the never-ending thrill of being a part of something that is so big you can hardly get your head around it and the promise that it just might change the world Thank you This is the human test a test to see if you are a human Please raise your hand if something applies to you Are we agreed Yes Then let's begin Have you ever eaten a booger long past your childhood It's okay it's safe here Have you ever made a small weird sound when you remembered something embarrassing Have you ever purposely lowercased the first letter of a text in order to come across as sad or disappointed Okay Have you ever ended a text with a period as a sign of aggression Okay Period Have you ever laughed or smiled when someone said something shitty to you and then spent the rest of the day wondering why you reacted that way Yes Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket a thousand times as you walked from the check-in to the gate Yes Have you ever put on a pair of pants and then much later realized that there was a loose sock smushed up against your thigh Good Have you ever tried to guess someone else's password so many times that it locked their account Mmm Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day you will be discovered as a fraud Yes it's safe here Have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn't discovered yet that you were just naturally great at Mmm Have you ever broken something in real life and then found yourself looking for an undo button in real life Have you ever misplaced your TED badge and then immediately started imagining what a three-day Vancouver vacation might look like Have you ever marveled at how someone you thought was so ordinary could suddenly become so beautiful Have you ever stared at your phone smiling like an idiot while texting with someone Have you ever subsequently texted that person the phrase I'm staring at the phone smiling like an idiot Have you ever been tempted to and then gave in to the temptation of looking through someone else's phone Have you ever had a conversation with yourself and then suddenly realized you're a real asshole to yourself Has your phone ever run out of battery in the middle of an argument and it sort of felt like the phone was breaking up with both of you Have you ever thought that working on an issue between you was futile because it should just be easier than this or this is supposed to happen just naturally Have you ever realized that very little in the long run just happens naturally Have you ever woken up blissfully and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance that someone had left you Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future without a person that no longer was in your life Have you ever looked back on that event with the sad smile of autumn and the realization that futures will happen regardless Congratulations You have now completed the test You are all human I'd like to introduce you to an organism: a slime mold Physarum polycephalum It's a mold with an identity crisis because it's not a mold so let's get that straight to start with It is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba It is a single-celled organism a cell that joins together with other cells to form a mass super-cell to maximize its resources or millions of nuclei all sharing a cell wall all operating as one entity In its natural habitat you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands eating rotting vegetation but you might equally find it in research laboratories classrooms and even artists' studios I first came across the slime mold about five years ago A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it The only instructions I was given that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology with scientific processes so living material is not uncommon for me I've worked with plants bacteria cuttlefish fruit flies So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do So I took it home and I watched I fed it a varied diet I observed as it networked It formed a connection between food sources I watched it leave a trail behind it indicating where it had been And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish it would escape and find a better home I captured my observations through time-lapse photography Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation but through the time lapse I could observe some really interesting behaviors For instance having fed on a nice pile of oats the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously When it meets itself it knows it's already there it recognizes it's there and instead retreats back and grows in other directions I was quite impressed by this feat at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory know itself and move with seeming intention I found countless scientific studies research papers journal articles all citing incredible work with this one organism and I'm going to share a few of those with you For example a team in Hokkaido University in Japan filled a maze with slime mold It joined together and formed a mass cell They introduced food at two points oats of course and it formed a connection between the food It retracted from empty areas and dead ends There are four possible routes through this maze yet time and time again the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route Quite clever The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold It didn't like it It doesn't like it cold It doesn't like it dry They did this at repeat intervals and each time the slime mold slowed down its growth in response However at the next interval the researchers didn't put the cold air on yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn A third experiment: the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats It fans out in a branching pattern As it goes each food node it finds it forms a network a connection to and keeps foraging After 26 hours it established quite a firm network between the different oats Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network a complex system developed over time by community dwellings civil engineering urban planning What had taken us well over 100 years took the slime mold just over a day The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem It is a biological computer As such it has been mathematically modeled algorithmically analyzed It's been sonified replicated simulated World over teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics programming and robotics So the question is how does this thing work It doesn't have a central nervous system It doesn't have a brain yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function It can learn it can remember it can solve problems it can make decisions So where does that intelligence lie So this is a microscopy a video I shot and it's about 100 times magnification sped up about 20 times and inside the slime mold there is a rhythmic pulsing flow a vein-like structure carrying cellular material nutrients and chemical information through the cell streaming first in one direction and then back in another And it is this continuous synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment but without any large-scale control center This is where its intelligence lies So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism A few years ago I set up SliMoCo the Slime Mould Collective It's an online open democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides The Slime Mould Collective membership is self-selecting People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me architects designers writers activists you name it It's a very interesting eclectic membership Just a few examples: an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area Here the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion communication and cooperation Other public engagement activities I run lots of slime mold workshops a creative way of engaging with the organism So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do and they design their own petri dish experiment an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slime Mould Collective And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people I've been working with filmmakers on a feature-length slime mold documentary and I stress feature-length which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is the world's first human slime mold experiment This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year We invited people to become slime mold for half an hour So we essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell and invited them to follow slime mold rules You have to communicate through oscillations no speaking You have to operate as one entity one mass cell no egos and the motivation for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food So a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing Being Slime Mold t-shirts wandered through the museum park When they met trees they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking This is a ludicrous experiment in many many ways This isn't hypothesis-driven We're not trying to prove demonstrate anything But what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence agency autonomy and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that ensued One of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park People talked about the human psychology of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos Other people talked about bacterial communication Each person brought in their own individual interpretation and our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative especially when given beer We didn't just give them oats We gave them beer as well But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold and the slime mold for me is a fascinating subject matter It's biologically fascinating it's computationally interesting but it's also a symbol a way of engaging with ideas of community collective behavior cooperation A lot of my work draws on the scientific research so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way And the slime mold is also my working material It's a coproducer of photographs prints animations participatory events Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me exactly it is a collaboration of sorts I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates but I can't control it The slime mold has the final say in the creative process And after all it has its own internal aesthetics These branching patterns that we see we see across all forms scales of nature from river deltas to lightning strikes from our own blood vessels to neural networks There's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry there's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful brainless blob Thank you I was born in Taiwan I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores and I like going to night markets I love the energy of the night markets the colors the lights the toys and all the unexpected things I find every time I go things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks When I was growing up I liked taking toys apart any kind of toys I'd find around the house like my brother's BB gun when he's not home I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play In these early installations I would take plastic sheets plastic bags and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house I would take things like highlighter pen mix it with water pump it through plastic tubing creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy I like these materials because of the way they look the way they feel and they're very affordable I also liked to make devices that work with body parts I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button get a different perspective and see what it does I also like to modify household appliances This is an automatic night light Some of you might have them at home I would cut out the light sensor add an extension line and use modeling clay stick it onto the television and then I would videotape my eye and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time so you turn on the lightbulb The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime and it will shut off the light I wanted to collect more different types of eyes so I built this device using bicycle helmets some lightbulbs and television sets It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures This sculpture has four eyes Each eye is controlling a different device This eye is turning itself around in a television This eye is inflating a plastic tube This eye is watching a video of another piece being made And these two eyes are activating glowing water Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums biennials triennial exhibitions around the world I love science and biology In 2007 I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean I love these creatures I love the way they look the way they feel They're soft they're slimy and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment either to attract mates for self-defense or to attract food This research inspired my work in many different ways things like movement or different light patterns So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out trying that out and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens This is an 8，000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor From afar they look alien-like but when you look closer they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous Thank you The first time I stood in the operating room and watched a real surgery I had no idea what to expect I was a college student in engineering I thought it was going to be like on TV Ominous music playing in the background beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face But it wasn't like that at all There was music playing on this day I think it was Madonna's greatest hits And there was plenty of conversation not just about the patient's heart rate but about sports and weekend plans And since then the more surgeries I watched the more I realized this is how it is In some weird way it's just another day at the office But every so often the music gets turned down everyone stops talking and stares at exactly the same thing And that's when you know that something absolutely critical and dangerous is happening The first time I saw that I was watching a type of surgery called laparoscopic surgery And for those of you who are unfamiliar laparoscopic surgery instead of the large open incision you might be used to with surgery a laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates these three or more small incisions in the patient And then inserts these long thin instruments and a camera and actually does the procedure inside the patient This is great because there's much less risk of infection much less pain shorter recovery time But there is a trade-off because these incisions are created with a long pointed device called a trocar And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through And now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere else Remember this You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through and you didn't know if it was going to go out the other side and straight into your hand or if you were going to get juice everywhere but you were terrified Right Every single time you did this you experienced the same fundamental physics that I was watching in the operating room that day And it turns out it really is a problem In 2003 the FDA actually came out and said that trocar incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery Again in 2009 we see a paper that says that trocars account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery And oh by the way this hasn't changed for 25 years So when I got to graduate school this is what I wanted to work on I was trying to explain to a friend of mine what exactly I was spending my time doing and I said It's like when you're drilling through a wall to hang something in your apartment There's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall and there's this plunge Right And he looked at me and he said You mean like when they drill into people's brains And I said Excuse me And then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains A lot of neurosurgical procedures actually start with a drill incision through the skull And if the surgeon isn't careful he can plunge directly into the brain So this is the moment when I started thinking okay cranial drilling laparoscopic surgery why not other areas of medicine Because think about it when was the last time you went to the doctor and you didn't get stuck with something Right So the truth is in medicine puncture is everywhere And here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found that involve some tissue puncture step And if we take just three of them laparoscopic surgery epidurals and cranial drilling these procedures account for over 30，000 complications every year in this country alone I call that a problem worth solving So let's take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures I mentioned epidurals This is an epidural needle It's used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools These are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions Here's a bayonette from the Civil War If I had told you it was a medical puncture device you probably would have believed me Because what's the difference So the more I did this research the more I thought there has to be a better way to do this And for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics So what are those physics Let's go back to drilling through a wall So you're applying a force on a drill towards the wall And Newton says the wall is going to apply force back equal and opposite So as you drill through the wall those forces balance But then there's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall and right at that moment the wall can't push back anymore But your brain hasn't reacted to that change in force So for that millisecond or however long it takes you to react you're still pushing and that unbalanced force causes an acceleration and that is the plunge But what if right at the moment of puncture you could pull that tip back actually oppose the forward acceleration That's what I set out to do So imagine you have a device and it's got some kind of sharp tip to cut through tissue What's the simplest way you could pull that tip back I chose a spring So when you extend that spring you extend that tip out so it's ready to puncture tissue the spring wants to pull the tip back How do you keep the tip in place until the moment of puncture I used this mechanism When the tip of the device is pressed against tissue the mechanism expands outwards and wedges in place against the wall And the friction that's generated locks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip But right at the moment of puncture the tissue can't push back on the tip anymore So the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip Let me show you that happening in slow motion This is about 2，000 frames a second and I'd like you to notice the tip that's right there on the bottom about to puncture through tissue And you'll see that right at the moment of puncture right there the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back I want to show it to you again a little closer up You're going to see the sharp bladed tip and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath Right there That happens within four 100ths of a second after puncture And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery or another procedure it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales But it didn't always look like this This was my first prototype Yes those are popsicle sticks and there's a rubber band at the top It took about 30 minutes to do this but it worked And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me It kept me up at night But I think it should fascinate you too because I said puncture is everywhere That means at some point it's going to be your problem too That first day in the operating room I never expected to find myself on the other end of a trocar But last year I got appendicitis when I was visiting Greece So I was in the hospital in Athens and the surgeon was telling me he was going to perform a laparoscopic surgery He was going to remove my appendix through these tiny incisions and he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery and what was going to happen He said Do you have any questions And I said Just one doc What kind of trocar do you use So my favorite quote about laparoscopic surgery comes from a Doctor H C Jacobaeus: It is puncture itself that causes risk That's my favorite quote because H。C Jacobaeus was the first person to ever perform laparoscopic surgery on humans and he wrote that in 1912 This is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there there's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it The truth is that's not always the case We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them So if you come across a problem that grabs you let it keep you up at night Allow yourself to be fascinated because there are so many lives to save Puzzles and magic I work in what most people think are two distinct fields but I believe they are the same I am both a magician and a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor which basically means I've taken the world's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives: the urge to solve Human beings are wired to solve to make order out of chaos It's certainly true for me I've been solving my whole life High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls and then at about that time I started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls There's nothing like starting a conversation with Hey did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth 20 points in Scrabble But back then I noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion When you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show you become a solver and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos the chaos of say a black-and-white puzzle grid a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles or a shuffled pack of playing cards And today as a cruciverbalist 23 points and an illusion designer I create that chaos I test your ability to solve Now it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping From birth we are wired to solve In one UCLA study newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns patterns like this: circle cross circle cross And then the pattern was changed: triangle square And by tracking an infant's gaze we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order It's remarkable So from infancy through old age the urge to solve unites us all and I even found this photo on Instagram of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee Like Now solving exists across all cultures The American invention is the crossword puzzle and this year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle first published in The New York World But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well China gives us tangrams which would test solvers' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces Chaos Order Order And order That one's my favorite let's hear it again Okay And how about this puzzle invented in 18th-century England: the jigsaw puzzle Is this not making order out of chaos So as you can see we are always solving We are always trying to decode our world It's an eternal quest It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in Don Quixote which by the way is the root of the word quixotry the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time 365 points But anyway Don Quixote is an important book You guys have read Don Quixote yes I'm seeing some heads nod Come on guys really Who's read Don Quixote Let's do this Raise your hands if you've read Don Quixote There we go Smart audience Who's read Don Quixote Get them up Okay good because I need somebody smart here because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is just how wired to solve all of you really are so I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me Let's see Everybody's looking away all of a sudden Can I Would you What is your name Gwen I'm not a mind reader I can see your name tag Come with me Gwen Everyone give her a round of applause make her feel welcome Gwen after you Are you so excited Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble Okay stand right here Gwen right here Now Gwen before we begin I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle which is here in this envelope and I will not go near it Okay And over here we have a drawing of some farm animals You can see we have an owl we have a horse a donkey a rooster an ox and a sheep and then here Gwen we have some fancy art store markers colors like can you see that word right there Gwen: Cobalt David Kwong: Cobalt yes Cobalt But we have a silver a red an emerald and an amber marker and Gwen you are going to color this drawing just like you were five years old one marker at a time It's going to be a lot of fun But I'm going to go over here I don't want to see what you're doing Okay so don't start yet Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes Now Gwen are you ready Pick up just one marker pick up just one marker and why don't you color in the horse for me Color in the horse big big big scribbles broad strokes don't worry about staying in the lines All right Great And why don't you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me Okay and pick up another marker out of the cup and take off the cap and color in the donkey for me color in the donkey Big scribbles Okay cool and re-cap that marker and place it on the table And pick up another marker for me and take off the cap Isn't this fun And color in the owl for me Color in the owl Okay and recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the rooster for me color in the rooster Good good good good good Big big big strokes Good good Pick up another marker out of the cup and color in the ox for me Color in the ox Okay good A lot of color on that and recap and place it on the table and pick up another marker out of the cup Oh I'm out Okay I'm going to turn around Did I forget Oh I forgot my purple marker This is still going to work though I think this is still going to work mostly So Gwen I'm going to hand you this envelope Don't open it yet Do not open it yet but I am going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made Okay great So we have a cobalt horse amber owl a silver ox yes okay a red donkey and what was the emerald color A rooster An emerald rooster Okay Now for the moment of truth Gwen we're going to take a look in that envelope Why don't you open it up and remove the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me and we will see if it matches your choices Yes I think it does We have a cobalt horse we have a red donkey we have an amber owl we have an emerald rooster a silver ox I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep but that's a pretty amazing coincidence don't you think Gwen well done That's beautiful I'll take that back from you So ladies and gentlemen how is this possible How is this possible Well could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages Well this is the puzzle I present to you Could there be order in the chaos that I created Let's take a closer look Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces What image did it ultimately become A cobalt horse The plot thickens And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster That one's my favorite And then we had an experiment with a silver ox And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee out of an amber owl Thank you Katy for taking that photo for me Oh and there's one more there's one more I believe you colored a red donkey Gwen Ladies and gentlemen could you raise your hands for me if you've read Don Quixote Who's read Don Quixote But wait but wait wait wait wait there's more There's more Gwen I was so confident that you were going to make these choices that I made another prediction and I put it in an even more indelible place and it's right here Ladies and gentlemen we have today's New York Times The date is March 18th 2014 Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well Really dig We hid them under there See if you can fish out the newspaper and open up to the arts section and you will find the crossword puzzle and the crossword puzzle today was written by yours truly You can see my name above the grid I'm going to give this to you Gwen to take a look Now let's take a look at another piece of the puzzle If you look at the first clue for 1-across it starts with the letter C for corrupt and just below that we have an O for outfielder and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down you get cobalt horse amber owl silver ox red donkey and emerald rooster That's pretty cool right It's The New York Times But wait wait wait wait Wait Oh Gwen do you recall how I forgot my purple marker and you were unable to color the sheep Well if you keep reading starting with 25-down it says Oh by the way the sheep can be left blank But wait wait wait there's one more thing there's one more thing there's one final piece of the puzzle Gwen I am so grateful for your choices because if we take a look at the first letters of your combinations we get C-H-A-O-S for chaos and O-R-D-E-R for order That's chaos and order We've all made order out of chaos So ladies and gentlemen the next time you find yourself with a puzzle whether it's in your life or in your work or maybe it's at the Sunday morning breakfast table with The New York Times remember you are all wired to solve Thank you On March 10 2011 I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab meeting with faculty students and staff and we were trying to figure out whether I should be the next director That night at midnight a magnitude 9 earthquake hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan My wife and family were in Japan and as the news started to come in I was panicking I was looking at the news streams and listening to the press conferences of the government officials and the Tokyo Power Company and hearing about this explosion at the nuclear reactors and this cloud of fallout that was headed towards our house which was only about 200 kilometers away And the people on TV weren't telling us anything that we wanted to hear I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor what was going on with the radiation whether my family was in danger So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing which was to go onto the Internet and try to figure out if I could take matters into my own hands On the Net I found there were a lot of other people like me trying to figure out what was going on and together we sort of loosely formed a group and we called it Safecast and we decided we were going to try to measure the radiation and get the data out to everybody else because it was clear that the government wasn't going to be doing this for us Three years later we have 16 million data points that you can download the designs and plug it into the network We have an app that shows you most of the radiation in Japan and other parts of the world We are arguably one of the most successful citizen science projects in the world and we have created the largest open dataset of radiation measurements And the interesting thing here is how did Thank you How did a bunch of amateurs who really didn't know what we were doing somehow come together and do what NGOs and the government were completely incapable of doing And I would suggest that this has something to do with the Internet It's not a fluke It wasn't luck and it wasn't because it was us It helped that it was an event that pulled everybody together but it was a new way of doing things that was enabled by the Internet and a lot of the other things that were going on and I want to talk a little bit about what those new principles are So remember before the Internet I call this B。I Okay So in B。I。 life was simple Things were Euclidian Newtonian somewhat predictable People actually tried to predict the future even the economists And then the Internet happened and the world became extremely complex extremely low-cost extremely fast and those Newtonian laws that we so dearly cherished turned out to be just local ordinances and what we found was that in this completely unpredictable world that most of the people who were surviving were working with sort of a different set of principles and I want to talk a little bit about that Before the Internet if you remember when we tried to create services what you would do is you'd create the hardware layer and the network layer and the software and it would cost millions of dollars to do anything that was substantial So when it costs millions of dollars to do something substantial what you would do is you'd get an MBA who would write a plan and get the money from V。C。s or big companies and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers and they'd build the thing This is the Before Internet B。I。 innovation model What happened after the Internet was the cost of innovation went down so much because the cost of collaboration the cost of distribution the cost of communication and Moore's Law made it so that the cost of trying a new thing became nearly zero and so you would have Google Facebook Yahoo students that didn't have permission permissionless innovation didn't have permission didn't have PowerPoints they just built the thing then they raised the money and then they sort of figured out a business plan and maybe later on they hired some MBAs So the Internet caused innovation at least in software and services to go from an MBA-driven innovation model to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model and it pushed innovation to the edges to the dorm rooms to the startups away from the large institutions the stodgy old institutions that had the power and the money and the authority And we all know this We all know this happened on the Internet It turns out it's happening in other things too Let me give you some examples So at the Media Lab we don't just do hardware We do all kinds of things We do biology we do hardware and Nicholas Negroponte famously said Demo or die as opposed to Publish or perish which was the traditional academic way of thinking And he often said the demo only has to work once because the primary mode of us impacting the world was through large companies being inspired by us and creating products like the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms But today with the ability to deploy things into the real world at such low cost I'm changing the motto now and this is the official public statement I'm officially saying Deploy or die You have to get the stuff into the real world for it to really count and sometimes it will be large companies and Nicholas can talk about satellites Thank you But we should be getting out there ourselves and not depending on large institutions to do it for us So last year we sent a bunch of students to Shenzhen and they sat on the factory floors with the innovators in Shenzhen and it was amazing What was happening there was you would have these manufacturing devices and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment and innovating right on the manufacturing equipment The factory was in the designer and the designer was literally in the factory And so what you would do is you'd go down to the stalls and you would see these cell phones So instead of starting little websites like the kids in Palo Alto do the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto make websites and so there's a rainforest of innovation going on in the cell phone What they do is they make a cell phone go down to the stall they sell some they look at the other kids' stuff go up make a couple thousand more go down Doesn't this sound like a software thing It sounds like agile software development A/B testing and iteration and what we thought you could only do with software kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware My next fellow I hope is going to be one of these innovators from Shenzhen And so what you see is that is pushing innovation to the edges We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that and that's great but this is Limor She is one of our favorite graduates and she is standing in front of a Samsung Techwin Pick and Place Machine This thing can put 23，000 components per hour onto an electronics board This is a factory in a box So what used to take a factory full of workers working by hand in this little box in New York she's able to have effectively She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen to do this manufacturing She can buy this box and she can manufacture it So manufacturing the cost of innovation the cost of prototyping distribution manufacturing hardware is getting so low that innovation is being pushed to the edges and students and startups are being able to build it This is a recent thing but this will happen and this will change just like it did with software Sorona is a DuPont process that uses a genetically engineered microbe to turn corn sugar into polyester It's 30 percent more efficient than the fossil fuel method and it's much better for the environment Genetic engineering and bioengineering are creating a whole bunch of great new opportunities for chemistry for computation for memory We will probably be doing a lot obviously doing health things but we will probably be growing chairs and buildings soon The problem is Sorona costs about 400 million dollars and took seven years to build It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days The thing is the cost of innovation in bioengineering is also going down This is desktop gene sequencer It used to cost millions and millions of dollars to sequence genes Now you can do it on a desktop like this and kids can do this in dorm rooms This is Gen9 gene assembler and so right now when you try to print a gene what you do is somebody in a factory with pipettes puts the thing together by hand you have one error per 100 base pairs and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money This new device assembles genes on a chip and instead of one error per 100 base pairs it's one error per 10，000 base pairs In this lab we will have the world's capacity of gene printing within a year 200 million base pairs a year This is kind of like when we went from transistor radios wrapped by hand to the Pentium This is going to become the Pentium of bioengineering pushing bioengineering into the hands of dorm rooms and startup companies So it's happening in software and in hardware and bioengineering and so this is a fundamental new way of thinking about innovation It's a bottom-up innovation it's democratic it's chaotic it's hard to control It's not bad but it's very different and I think that the traditional rules that we have for institutions don't work anymore and most of us here operate with a different set of principles One of my favorite principles is the power of pull which is the idea of pulling resources from the network as you need them and controlling everything So in the case of the Safecast story I didn't know anything when the earthquake happened but I was able to find Sean who was the hackerspace community organizer and Peter the analog hardware hacker who made our first Geiger counter and Dan who built the Three Mile Island monitoring system after the Three Mile Island meltdown And these people I wouldn't have been able to find beforehand and probably were better that I found them just in time from the network I'm a three-time college dropout so learning over education is very near and dear to my heart but to me education is what people do to you and learning is what you do to yourself And it feels like and I'm biased it feels like they're trying to make you memorize the whole encyclopedia before they let you go out and play and to me I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone and it feels like they assume you're going to be on top of some mountain all by yourself with a number 2 pencil trying to figure out what to do when in fact you're always going to be connected you're always going to have friends and you can pull Wikipedia up whenever you need it and what you need to learn is how to learn In the case of Safecast a bunch of amateurs when we started three years ago I would argue that we probably as a group know more than any other organization about how to collect data and publish data and do citizen science Compass over maps So this one the idea is that the cost of writing a plan or mapping something is getting so expensive and it's not very accurate or useful So in the Safecast story we knew we needed to collect data we knew we wanted to publish the data and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan we first said oh let's get Geiger counters Oh they've run out Let's build them There aren't enough sensors Okay then we can make a mobile Geiger counter We can drive around We can get volunteers We don't have enough money Let's Kickstarter it We could not have planned this whole thing but by having a very strong compass we eventually got to where we were going and to me it's very similar to agile software development but this idea of compasses is very important So I think the good news is that even though the world is extremely complex what you need to do is very simple I think it's about stopping this notion that you need to plan everything you need to stock everything and you need to be so prepared and focus on being connected always learning fully aware and super present So I don't like the word futurist I think we should be now-ists like we are right now Thank you When we think about prejudice and bias we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things And this idea is nicely summarized by the British critic William Hazlitt who wrote Prejudice is the child of ignorance I want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken I want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural they're often rational and they're often even moral and I think that once we understand this we're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong when they have horrible consequences and we're in a better position to know what to do when this happens So start with stereotypes You look at me you know my name you know certain facts about me and you could make certain judgments You could make guesses about my ethnicity my political affiliation my religious beliefs We're very good at this sort of thing And we're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind but rather it's a specific instance of a more general process which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel instances of these categories So everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs and based on this you could see unfamiliar examples and you could guess you could sit on the chair you could eat the apple the dog will bark Now we might be wrong The chair could collapse if you sit on it the apple might be poison the dog might not bark and in fact this is my dog Tessie who doesn't bark But for the most part we're good at this For the most part we make good guesses both in the social domain and the non-social domain and if we weren't able to do so if we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter we wouldn't survive And in fact Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this He writes Without the aid of prejudice and custom I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances nor what to feel in any relation of life Or take bias Now sometimes we break the world up into us versus them into in-group versus out-group and sometimes when we do this we know we're doing something wrong and we're kind of ashamed of it But other times we're proud of it We openly acknowledge it And my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a Republican debate prior to the last election Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question the question in the hall on foreign aid Yes ma'am The American people are suffering in our country right now Why do we continue to send foreign aid to other countries when we need all the help we can get for ourselves AC: Governor Perry what about that Rick Perry: Absolutely I think it's— Paul Bloom: Each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question which is as Americans we should care more about Americans than about other people And in fact in general people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity loyalty pride patriotism towards their country or towards their ethnic group Regardless of your politics many people feel proud to be American and they favor Americans over other countries Residents of other countries feel the same about their nation and we feel the same about our ethnicities Now some of you may reject this Some of you may be so cosmopolitan that you think that ethnicity and nationality should hold no moral sway But even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull towards the in-group in the domain of friends and family of people you're close to and so even you make a distinction between us versus them Now this distinction is natural enough and often moral enough but it can go awry and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919 He left to go to university in France because as a Jew he couldn't go to university in Poland and then he enlisted in the French military in World War II He was captured and ended up in a prisoner of war camp and it was a terrifying time for him because if it was discovered that he was a Jew he could have been moved to a concentration camp where he most likely would not have survived And in fact when the war ended and he was released most of his friends and family were dead He got involved in different pursuits He helped out the war orphans But he had a long-lasting interest in the science of prejudice on stereotypes opened up he applied for it and he won it and then he began this amazing career And what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the Holocaust was wrong Many people most people at the time viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans some genetic taint some authoritarian personality And Tajfel rejected this Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust is just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us And to explore this he did a series of classic studies with British adolescents And in one of his studies what he did was he asked the British adolescents all sorts of questions and then based on their answers he said I've looked at your answers and based on the answers I have determined that you are either he told half of them a Kandinsky lover you love the work of Kandinsky or a Klee lover you love the work of Klee It was entirely bogus Their answers had nothing to do with Kandinsky or Klee They probably hadn't heard of the artists He just arbitrarily divided them up But what he found was these categories mattered so when he later gave the subjects money they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group than members of the other group Worse they were actually most interested in establishing a difference between their group and other groups so they would give up money for their own group if by doing so they could give the other group even less This bias seems to show up very early So my colleague and wife Karen Wynn at Yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets and the puppets have certain food preferences So one of the puppets might like green beans The other puppet might like graham crackers They test the babies own food preferences and babies typically prefer the graham crackers But the question is does this matter to babies in how they treat the puppets And it matters a lot They tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have and worse they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste We see this sort of in-group out-group psychology all the time We see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies We see it in its extreme in cases of war where the out-group isn't merely given less but dehumanized as in the Nazi perspective of Jews as vermin or lice or the American perspective of Japanese as rats Stereotypes can also go awry So often they're rational and useful but sometimes they're irrational they give the wrong answers and other times they lead to plainly immoral consequences And the case that's been most studied is the case of race There was a fascinating study prior to the 2008 election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America as in an unconscious association with the American flag And in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain and they found McCain is thought of as more American than Obama and to some extent people aren't that surprised by hearing that McCain is a celebrated war hero and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story than Obama But they also compared Obama to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama even though subjects explicitly understood that he's not American at all But they were responding of course to the color of his skin These stereotypes and biases have real-world consequences both subtle and very important In one recent study researchers put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards Some of them were held by white hands others by black hands They were the same baseball cards The ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands In research done at Stanford psychologists explored the case of people sentenced for the murder of a white person It turns out holding everything else constant you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left and this is in large part because the man on the right looks more prototypically black more prototypically African-American and this apparently influences people's decisions over what to do about him So now that we know about this how do we combat it And there are different avenues One avenue is to appeal to people's emotional responses to appeal to people's empathy and we often do that through stories So if you are a liberal parent and you want to encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families you might give them a book like this Heather Has Two Mommies If you are conservative and have a different attitude you might give them a book like this Help Mom There Are Liberals under My Bed But in general stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history So Stalin apocryphally said A single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic and Mother Teresa said If I look at the mass I will never act If I look at the one I will Psychologists have explored this For instance in one study people were given a list of facts about a crisis and it was seen how much they would donate to solve this crisis and another group was given no facts at all but they were told of an individual and given a name and given a face and it turns out that they gave far more None of this I think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work People don't tend to deluge people with facts and statistics Rather you show them faces you show them people It's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to The story perhaps apocryphal is that President Lincoln invited her to the White House in the middle of the Civil War and said to her So you're the little lady who started this great war And he was talking about Uncle Tom's Cabin Uncle Tom's Cabin is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or perhaps not even literature but it does a great job of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of put themselves in the shoes of slaves And that could well have been a catalyst for great social change More recently looking at America in the last several decades there's some reason to believe that shows like The Cosby Show radically changed American attitudes towards African-Americans while shows like Will and Grace and Modern Family changed American attitudes towards gay men and women I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in America for moral change has been a situation comedy But it's not all emotions and I want to end by appealing to the power of reason At some point in his wonderful book The Better Angels of Our Nature Steven Pinker says the Old Testament says love thy neighbor and the New Testament says love thy enemy but I don't love either one of them not really but I don't want to kill them I know I have obligations to them but my moral feelings to them my moral beliefs about how I should behave towards them aren't grounded in love What they're grounded in is the understanding of human rights a belief that their life is as valuable to them as my life is to me and to support this he tells a story by the great philosopher Adam Smith and I want to tell this story too though I'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people and imagine that the thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with It could be China or India or a country in Africa And Smith says how would you respond And you would say well that's too bad and you'd go on to the rest of your life If you were to open up The New York Times online or something and discover this and in fact this happens to us all the time we go about our lives But imagine instead Smith says you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped off Smith says that would matter a lot You would not sleep that night wondering about that So this raises the question: Would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger Now answer this in the privacy of your own head but Smith says absolutely not what a horrid thought And so this raises the question and so as Smith puts it When our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble And Smith's answer is It is reason principle conscience This calls to us with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions that we are but one of the multitude in no respect better than any other in it And this last part is what is often described as the principle of impartiality And this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world's religions in all of the different versions of the golden rule and in all of the world's moral philosophies which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view The best articulation of this view is actually for me it's not from a theologian or from a philosopher but from Humphrey Bogart at the end of Casablanca So spoiler alert he's telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good and he says to her and I won't do the accent but he says to her It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world Our reason could cause us to override our passions Our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy could motivate us to write a book like Uncle Tom's Cabin or read a book like Uncle Tom's Cabin and our reason can motivate us to create customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us from acting upon our impulses when as rational beings we feel we should be constrained This is what a constitution is A constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present and what it says is no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term no matter how much white Americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery we can't We have bound ourselves And we bind ourselves in other ways as well We know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job for an award we are strongly biased by their race we are biased by their gender we are biased by how attractive they are and sometimes we might say Well fine that's the way it should be But other times we say This is wrong And so to combat this we don't just try harder but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can't bias us which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature We have gut feelings instincts emotions and they affect our judgments and our actions for good and for evil but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning and we can use these to in some cases accelerate and nourish our emotions and in other cases staunch them And it's in this way that reason helps us create a better world Thank you This is a lot of ones and zeros It's what we call binary information This is how computers talk It's how they store information It's how computers think It's how computers do I'm a cybersecurity researcher which means my job is to sit down with this information and try to make sense of it to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean Unfortunately for me we're not just talking about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros of ones and zeros more than anyone could possibly comprehend Now as exciting as that sounds when I first started doing cyber when I first started doing cyber I wasn't sure that sifting through ones and zeros because in my mind cyber was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer and maybe maybe on my most glorious day Those are important things But after 30 minutes of work as a defense contractor I soon found out that my idea of cyber was a little bit off In fact in terms of national security keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer was surprisingly low on their priority list Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives because computers are an integral part of all of our lives even if you don't own a computer Computers control everything in your car from your GPS to your airbags They control your phone and get someone on the other line They control our nation's entire infrastructure They're the reason you have electricity heat clean water food Computers control our military equipment everything from missile silos to satellites to nuclear defense networks All of these things are made possible and therefore because of cyber and when something goes wrong cyber can make all of these things impossible But that's where I step in A big part of my job is defending all of these things keeping them working but once in a while part of my job is to break one of these things because cyber isn't just about defense it's also about offense We're entering an age where we talk about cyberweapons In fact so great is the potential for cyber offense that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare Warfare It's not necessarily a bad thing On the one hand it means we have whole new front but on the other hand it means we have a whole new way to attack from doing evil things Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building and he wants to do this again and again in the future So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes He's going to use a cell phone as a remote detonator Now it used to be the only way we had to stop this terrorist was with a hail of bullets and a car chase but that's not necessarily true anymore from 1，000 miles away because whether he knew it or not he stepped into the realm of cyber A well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone disable the overvoltage protections on his battery drastically overload the circuit cause the battery to overheat and explode No more phone no more detonator maybe no more terrorist from a thousand miles away So how does this work It all comes back to those ones and zeros Binary information makes your phone work and used correctly it can make your phone explode So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective starts to seem kind of exciting But here's the catch: This is hard really really hard and here's why Think about everything you have on your cell phone You've got the pictures you've taken You've got the music you listen to You've got your contacts list your email and probably 500 apps you've never used in your entire life that controls your phone and somewhere buried inside of that code is a tiny piece that controls your battery and that's what I'm really after but all of this just a bunch of ones and zeros and it's all just mixed together In cyber we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles because everything pretty much looks alike I'm looking for one key piece but it just blends in with everything else So let's step back from this theoretical situation of making a terrorist's phone explode and look at something that actually happened to me my job always starts with sitting down with a whole bunch of binary information to do something specific In this case I was looking for a very advanced that I knew I could hack but it was somewhere buried inside of a billion ones and zeroes Unfortunately for me I didn't know quite what I was looking for which makes finding it really really hard When I have to do that what I have to do of this binary information try to decipher each piece and see if it might be So after a while I thought I had found the piece I was looking for I thought maybe this was it It seemed to be about right but I couldn't quite tell I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented So I spent some time trying to put this together but wasn't having a whole lot of luck and finally I decided I'm going to get through this and I'm not going to leave until I figure out what this represents So that's what I did I came in on a Saturday morning and about 10 hours in I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle I just didn't know how they fit together I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant At the 15-hour mark but I had a creeping suspicion that what I was looking at was not at all related to what I was looking for By 20 hours the pieces started to come together very slowly and I was pretty sure I was going down the wrong path at this point but I wasn't going to give up After 30 hours in the lab and I was right it wasn't what I was looking for I spent 30 hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten that had nothing at all to do with what I was trying to accomplish So I was frustrated I was exhausted After 30 hours in the lab I probably smelled horrible and calling it quits I took a step back and asked myself what went wrong here How could I make such a stupid mistake I'm really pretty good at this I do this for a living So what happened Well I thought when you're looking at information at this level It's easy to not see the forest through the trees It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole and waste a tremendous amount of time doing the wrong thing But I had this epiphany since day one This is how computers think ones and zeros It's not how people think to think more like computers so that we can understand this information Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem we should have been making the problem fit our minds for analyzing huge amounts of information just not like this So what if we could unlock that potential to the right kind of information So with these ideas in mind I sprinted out of my basement lab at work to my basement lab at home which looked pretty much the same The main difference is at work I'm surrounded by cyber materials and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation At home I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned So I poured through every book I could find every idea I'd ever encountered to see how could we translate a problem The biggest question was what do we want to translate it to What do our brains do perfectly naturally that we could exploit My answer was vision We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information We can combine color gradients depth cues That's incredible we could really unlock the power of our brains to process this stuff So I started looking at the binary information and I asked myself what do I do when I first encounter something like this the very first question I want to answer I don't care what it does how it works is by looking at chunks sequential chunks of binary information what this information must be This is what your contacts list would look like It's really hard to analyze this at this level that I would be trying to find to a visual representation translate those relationships this is what we get This is what English text looks like from a visual abstraction perspective All of a sudden it shows us all the same information that was in the ones and zeros but show us it in an entirely different way a way that we can immediately comprehend We can instantly see all of the patterns here It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here but hours days to pick them out in ones and zeros It takes minutes for anybody to learn what these patterns represent here but years of experience in cyber in ones and zeros So this piece is caused by lower case letters followed by lower case letters inside of that contact list This is upper case by upper case upper case by lower case lower case by upper case We can go through every little detail of the binary information in seconds as opposed to weeks months at this level This is what an image looks like from your cell phone But this is what it looks like This is what your music looks like but here's its visual abstraction Most importantly for me this is what the code on your cell phone looks like This is what I'm after in the end but this is its visual abstraction If I can find this I can't make the phone explode I could spend weeks trying to find this in ones and zeros but it takes me seconds to pick out a visual abstraction like this One of those most remarkable parts about all of this is it gives us an entirely new way to understand new information stuff that we haven't seen before So I know what English looks like at a binary level and I know what its visual abstraction looks like but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life It would take me weeks just to figure out what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros but because our brains can instantly pick up and recognize these subtle patterns inside of these visual abstractions we can unconsciously apply those in new situations So this is what Russian looks like in a visual abstraction Because I know what one language looks like I can recognize other languages This is what a photograph looks like but this is what clip art looks like This is what the code on your phone looks like but this is what the code on your computer looks like Our brains can pick up on these patterns in ways that we never could have from looking at raw ones and zeros But we've really only scratched the surface of what we can do with this approach We've only begun to unlock the capabilities of our minds to process visual information If we take those same concepts and translate them into three dimensions instead we find entirely new ways of making sense of information In seconds we can pick out every pattern here we can see the cross associated with code We can see cubes associated with text We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts Things that would take us weeks months to find in ones and zeroes in some sort of visual abstraction and as we continue to go through this and throw more and more information at it what we find is that we're capable of processing just by using our brain's built-in ability to analyze patterns but all this tells me is what I'm looking at So at this point based on visual patterns I can find the code on the phone But that's not enough to blow up a battery The next thing I need to find is the code that controls the battery but we're back to the needle in a stack of needles problem That code looks pretty much like all the other code on that system So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that You have code that controls your screen that controls your buttons that controls your microphones so even if I can't find the code for the battery I bet I can find one of those things So the next step in my binary analysis process is to look at pieces of information that are similar to each other It's really really hard to do at a binary level but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead I don't even have to sift through the raw data All I have to do is wait for the image to light up to see when I'm at similar pieces I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs to find exactly what I'm looking for So at this point in the process responsible for controlling your battery but that's still not enough to blow up a phone For this I need to identify very subtle very detailed relationships within that binary information another very hard thing to do into a physical representation It can find all the detailed patterns all the important pieces for us whereas the same process would have taken months in the past This is all well and good I wanted to find out if this would really work in the work I do every day So I was playing around with these same concepts and yet again I was trying to find a very detailed specific piece of code thinking I was looking at the right thing only to see this doesn't have the connectivity I would have expected for the code I was looking for In fact I'm not really sure what this is but when I stepped back a level and looked at the similarities within the code I saw this doesn't have similarities like any code that exists out there In fact from this perspective I could tell this isn't code This is an image of some sort And from here I can see it's not just an image this is a photograph Now that I know it's a photograph I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques to visualize and understand that information so in a matter of seconds we can take this information shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques in order to find out exactly what we were looking at I saw it was that darn kitten again All this is enabled because we were able to find a way to translate a very hard problem to something our brains do very naturally Well for kittens it means no more hiding in ones and zeros For me it means no more wasted weekends For cyber it means we have a radical new way to tackle the most impossible problems in the evolving theater of cyber warfare but for all of us it means that cyber engineers now have the ability to become first responders When seconds count we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys Thank you The human voice: It's the instrument we all play It's the most powerful sound in the world probably It's the only one that can start a war or say I love you And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people don't listen to them And why is that How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world What I'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large habits that we can all fall into First gossip speaking ill of somebody who's not present Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us Second judging We know people who are like this in conversation and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time Third negativity You can fall into this My mother in the last years of her life became very very negative and it's hard to listen I remember one day I said to her It's October 1 today and she said I know isn't it dreadful It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative And another form of negativity complaining Well this is the national art of the U。K It's our national sport We complain about the weather about sport about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world Excuses We've all met this guy Maybe we've all been this guy Some people have a blamethrower They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who is being like that Penultimate the sixth of the seven embroidery exaggeration It demeans our language actually sometimes For example if I see something that really is awesome what do I call it And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying out and out lying and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us And finally dogmatism the confusion of facts with opinions When those two things get conflated you're listening into the wind You know somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true It's difficult to listen to that So here they are seven deadly sins of speaking These are things I think we need to avoid But is there a positive way to think about this Yes there is I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world Fortunately these things spell a word The word is hail and it has a great definition as well I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head I'm talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things So what do they stand for See if you can guess The H honesty of course being true in what you say being straight and clear The A is authenticity just being yourself A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth which I think is a lovely way to put it actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust And the L is love I don't mean romantic love but I do mean wishing people well for two reasons First of all I think absolute honesty may not be what we want I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning Perhaps that's not necessary Tempered with love of course honesty is a great thing But also if you're really wishing somebody well it's very hard to judge them at the same time I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously So hail Also now that's what you say and it's like the old song it is what you say it's also the way that you say it You have an amazing toolbox This instrument is incredible and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking Register for example Now falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time but there's a register in between I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches You can locate your voice however So if I talk up here in my nose you can hear the difference If I go down here in my throat which is where most of us speak from most of the time But if you want weight you need to go down here to the chest You hear the difference We vote for politicians with lower voices it's true because we associate depth with power and with authority That's register Then we have timbre It's the way your voice feels Again the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich smooth warm like hot chocolate Well if that's not you that's not the end of the world because you can train Go and get a voice coach And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice Then prosody I love prosody This is the sing-song the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning It's root one for meaning in conversation People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all That's where the world monotonic comes from or monotonous monotone Also we have repetitive prosody now coming in where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question it's a statement And if you repeat that one over and over it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody which I think is a shame so let's try and break that habit Pace I can get very very excited by saying something really really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize and at the end of that of course is our old friend silence There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk is there It can be very powerful Of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal but you can do it just with pitch Where did you leave my keys Where did you leave my keys So slightly different meaning in those two deliveries And finally volume I can get really excited by using volume Sorry about that if I startled anybody Or I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet Some people broadcast the whole time Try not to do that That's called sodcasting imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately Not nice Of course where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people It might be proposing marriage asking for a raise a wedding speech Whatever it is if it's really important you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up Warm up your voice Actually let me show you how to do that Would you all like to stand up for a moment I'm going to show you the six vocal warmup exercises that I do before every talk I ever do Anytime you're going to talk to anybody important do these First arms up deep breath in and sigh out ahhhhh like that One more time Ahhhh very good Now we're going to warm up our lips And now brrrrrrrrrr just like when you were a kid Brrrr Now your lips should be coming alive We're going to do the tongue next Beautiful You're getting really good at this And then roll an R Rrrrrrr That's like champagne for the tongue Finally and if I can only do one the pros call this the siren It's really good It starts with we and goes to aw The we is high the aw is low Fantastic Give yourselves a round of applause Take a seat thank you Next time you speak do those in advance Now let me just put this in context to close This is a serious point here This is where we are now right We speak not very well into people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose Or to make that a bit larger what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound That would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading Thank you Thank you I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon and my research focuses on usable privacy and security and so my friends like to give me examples of their frustrations with computing systems especially frustrations related to unusable privacy and security So passwords are something that I hear a lot about A lot of people are frustrated with passwords and it's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess But what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems It's tough At Carnegie Mellon they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords The password requirement up through 2009 was just that you had to have a password with at least one character Pretty easy But then they changed things and at the end of 2009 they announced that we were going to have a new policy and this new policy required passwords that were at least eight characters long with an uppercase letter lowercase letter a digit a symbol you couldn't use the same character more than three times and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary Now when they implemented this new policy a lot of people my colleagues and friends came up to me and they said Wow now that's really unusable Why are they doing this to us and why didn't you stop them And I said Well you know what They didn't ask me But I got curious and I decided to go talk to the people in charge of our computer systems and find out what led them to introduce this new policy and they said that the university had joined a consortium of universities and one of the requirements of membership was that we had to have stronger passwords that complied with some new requirements and these requirements were that our passwords had to have a lot of entropy Now entropy is a complicated term but basically it measures the strength of passwords But the thing is there isn't actually a standard measure of entropy Now the National Institute of Standards and Technology has a set of guidelines which have some rules of thumb for measuring entropy but they don't have anything too specific and the reason they only have rules of thumb is it turns out they don't actually have any good data on passwords In fact their report states Unfortunately we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules NIST would like to obtain more data on the passwords users actually choose but system administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others So this is a problem but our research group looked at it as an opportunity We said Well there's a need for good password data Maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here So the first thing we did is we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students faculty and staff and asked them for information about their passwords Now we didn't say Give us your password No we just asked them about their password How long is it Does it have a digit Does it have a symbol And were you annoyed at having to create a new one last week So we got results from 470 students faculty and staff and indeed we confirmed that the new policy was very annoying but we also found that people said they felt more secure with these new passwords We found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down and only 13 percent of them did but disturbingly 80 percent of people said they were reusing their password Now this is actually more dangerous than writing your password down because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers So if you have to write your passwords down but don't reuse them We also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords So CMU allows 32 possible symbols but as you can see there's only a small number that most people are using so we're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords So this was a really interesting study and now we had data from 470 people but in the scheme of things that's really not very much password data and so we looked around to see where could we find additional password data So it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords and they often go and post these passwords on the Internet So we were able to get access to some of these stolen password sets This is still not really ideal for research though because it's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords So we wanted to find some better source of data So we decided that one thing we could do is we could do a study and have people actually create passwords for our study So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute a few minutes an hour and pay people a penny ten cents a few dollars to do a task for you and then you pay them through Amazon。com So we paid people about 50 cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey So we did this and we collected 5，000 passwords and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with So some people had a pretty easy policy we call it Basic8 and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters Then some people had a much harder policy and this was very similar to the CMU policy that it had to have eight characters including uppercase lowercase digit symbol and pass a dictionary check And one of the other policies we tried and there were a whole bunch more but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16 and the only requirement here was that your password had to have at least 16 characters All right so now we had 5，000 passwords and so we had much more detailed information Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating but as you may recall there isn't a good measure of password strength So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using or that we could find information about in the research literature So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form called a hash and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is run it through a hashing function and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list So a dumb attacker will try every password in order They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB and this is going to take a really long time before they get any passwords that people are really likely to actually have A smart attacker on the other hand does something much more clever They look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets and they guess those first So they're going to start by guessing password and then they'll guess I love you and monkey and 12345678 because these are the passwords that are most likely for people to have In fact some of you probably have these passwords So what we found by running all of these 5，000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong and the complex passwords were pretty strong too However when we looked at the survey data we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords and the long passwords were a lot more usable and in some cases they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords So this suggests that instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords Now here's the problem though: Some people had long passwords that actually weren't very strong You can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess So we need to do more than just say long passwords There has to be some additional requirements and some of our ongoing research is looking at what additional requirements we should add to make for stronger passwords that also are going to be easy for people to remember and type Another approach to getting people to have stronger passwords is to use a password meter Here are some examples You may have seen these on the Internet when you were creating passwords We decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work Do they actually help people have stronger passwords and if so which ones are better So we tested password meters that were different sizes shapes colors different words next to them and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny As you type a better password the bunny dances faster and faster So this was pretty fun What we found was that password meters do work Most of the password meters were actually effective and the dancing bunny was very effective too but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the Internet today are too soft They tell you you're doing a good job too early and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback you probably would have better passwords Now another approach to better passwords perhaps is to use pass phrases instead of passwords So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases and if you look at the second row of this cartoon you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase correct horse battery staple would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember He says in fact you've already remembered it And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not In fact everybody who I talk to who I mention I'm doing password research they point out this cartoon Oh have you seen it That xkcd Correct horse battery staple So we did the research study to see what would actually happen So in our study we used Mechanical Turk again and we had the computer pick the random words in the pass phrase Now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words If we asked a human to do it they would pick things that were not very random So we tried a few different conditions In one condition the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the English language and so you'd get pass phrases like try there three come And we looked at that and we said Well that doesn't really seem very memorable So then we tried picking words that came from specific parts of speech so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun That comes up with something that's sort of sentence-like So you can get a pass phrase like plan builds sure power or end determines red drug And these seemed a little bit more memorable and maybe people would like those a little bit better We wanted to compare them with passwords and so we had the computer pick random passwords they don't really look very memorable And then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password So here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable like tufritvi and vadasabi That one kind of rolls off your tongue So these were random passwords that were generated by our computer So what we found in this study was that surprisingly pass phrases were not actually all that good People were not really better at remembering the pass phrases than these random passwords and because the pass phrases are longer they took longer to type and people made more errors while typing them in So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases Sorry all of you xkcd fans On the other hand we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better So one of the problems with some of the studies that we've done is that because they're all done using Mechanical Turk these are not people's real passwords They're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study And we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon and asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords Not surprisingly they were a little bit reluctant to share them with us but we were actually able to work out a system with them where they put all of the real passwords for 25，000 CMU students faculty and staff into a locked computer in a locked room not connected to the Internet and they ran code on it that we wrote to analyze these passwords They audited our code They ran the code And so we never actually saw anybody's password We got some interesting results and those of you Tepper students in the back will be very interested in this So we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1。8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school We have lots of other really interesting demographic information as well The other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords there was actually a lot of similarities and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually collecting passwords using these Mechanical Turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords So that was good news Okay I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts and I made this quilt here It's called Security Blanket And this quilt has the 1，000 most frequent passwords stolen from the RockYou website And the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset And what I did is I created this word cloud and I went through all 1，000 words and I categorized them into loose thematic categories And it was in some cases it was kind of difficult to figure out what category they should be in and then I color-coded them So here are some examples of the difficulty So justin Is that the name of the user their boyfriend their son Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan Or princess Is that a nickname Are they Disney princess fans Or maybe that's the name of their cat Iloveyou appears many times in many different languages There's a lot of love in these passwords If you look carefully you'll see there's also some profanity but it was really interesting to me to see that there's a lot more love than hate in these passwords And there are animals a lot of animals and monkey is the most common animal and the 14th most popular password overall And this was really curious to me and I wondered Why are monkeys so popular And so in our last password study any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word monkey in it we asked them why they had a monkey in their password And what we found out -- we found 17 people so far I think who have the word monkey -- We found out about a third of them said they have a pet named monkey or a friend whose nickname is monkey and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute And that guy is really cute So it seems that at the end of the day when we make passwords we either make something that's really easy to type a common pattern or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we've created the password for or whatever Or we think about things that make us happy and we create our password based on things that make us happy And while this makes typing and remembering your password more fun it also makes it a lot easier to guess your password So I know a lot of these TED Talks are inspirational and they make you think about nice happy things but when you're creating your password try to think about something else Thank you Twenty-three years ago at the age of 19 I shot and killed a man I was a young drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi-automatic pistol But that wasn't the end of my story In fact it was beginning and the 23 years since is a story of acknowledgment apology and atonement But it didn't happen in the way that you might imagine or think These things occurred in my life especially to me See like many of you growing up I was an honor roll student a scholarship student with dreams of becoming a doctor But things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated and eventually divorced The actual events are pretty straightforward At the age of 17 I got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in Detroit My friend rushed me to the hospital Doctors pulled the bullets out patched me up and sent me back to the same neighborhood where I got shot Throughout this ordeal no one hugged me no one counseled me no one told me I would be okay No one told me that I would live in fear that I would become paranoid No one told me that one day I would become the person behind the trigger Fourteen months later at 2 a。m。 I fired the shots that caused a man's death When I entered prison I was bitter I was angry I was hurt I didn't want to take responsibility I blamed everybody from my parents to the system I rationalized my decision to shoot because in the hood where I come from it's better to be the shooter than the person getting shot As I sat in my cold cell I felt helpless unloved and abandoned I felt like nobody cared and I reacted with hostility to my confinement And I found myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble I ran black market stores I loan sharked and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison I had in fact become what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called the worst of the worst And because of my activity I landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration Now as I see it solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself but find myself I did One day I was pacing my cell when an officer came and delivered mail I looked at a couple of letters before I looked at the letter that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it And anytime I would get a letter from my son it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine And on this particular day I opened this letter and in capital letters he wrote My mama told me why you was in prison: murder He said Dad don't kill Jesus watches what you do Pray to Him Now I wasn't religious at that time nor am I religious now but it was something so profound about my son's words They made me examine things about my life that I hadn't considered It was the first time in my life that I had actually thought about the fact that my son would see me as a murderer I sat back on my bunk and I reflected on something I had read in Plato that the unexamined life isn't worth living At that point is when the transformation began But it didn't come easy One of the things I realized which was part of the transformation was that there were four key things The first thing was I had great mentors Now I know some of you all are probably thinking how did you find a great mentor in prison But in my case some of my mentors who are serving life sentences were some of the best people to ever come into my life because they forced me to look at my life honestly and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making The second thing was literature Prior to going to prison I didn't know that there were so many brilliant black poets authors and philosophers and then I had the great fortune of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography and it shattered every stereotype I had about myself The third thing was family For 19 years my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith because he believed that I had what it took to turn my life around I also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two-year-old son Sekou and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way The final thing was writing When I got that letter from my son I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement Earlier in my incarceration I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim and in that letter she told me she forgave me because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions It was the first time in my life that I ever felt open to forgiving myself One of the things that happened after that experience is that I thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me and how much I wanted to share this with them And so I started talking to them about some of their experiences and I was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments And most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it around that currently holds 2。5 million people in prison as opposed to rehabilitate or transform So I made it up in my mind that if I was ever released from prison that I would do everything in my power to help change that In 2010 I walked out of prison for the first time after two decades Now imagine if you will Fred Flintstone walking into an episode of The Jetsons That was pretty much what my life was like For the first time I was exposed to the Internet social media cars that talk like KITT from Knight Rider But the thing that fascinated me the most was phone technology See when I went to prison our car phones were this big and required two people to carry them So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed my little Blackberry and I started learning how to text But the thing is the people around me they didn't realize that I had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant like LOL OMG LMAO and I asked him to do something and he responded back K And I was like What is K And he was like K is okay So in my head I was like Well what the hell is wrong with K And so I text him a question mark And he said K okay And so I tap back FU And then he texts back and he asks me why was I cussing him out And I said LOL FU as in I finally understand And so fast forward three years I'm doing relatively good I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab I work for an amazing company called BMe I teach at the University of Michigan but it's been a struggle because I realize that there are more men and women coming home who are not going to be afforded those opportunities I've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women helping others reenter society and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit He's 45 years old He's currently enrolled in college And one of the things that we talked about is the three things that I found important in my personal transformation the first being acknowledgment I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt The second thing was apologizing I had to apologize to the people I had hurt Even though I had no expectations of them accepting it it was important to do because it was the right thing But I also had to apologize to myself The third thing was atoning For me atoning meant going back into my community and working with at-risk youth who were on the same path but also becoming at one with myself Through my experience of being locked up one of the things I discovered is this: the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are redeemable and the fact is 90 percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community My wish today is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration that we will do away with the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality because it's proven it doesn't work My journey is a unique journey but it doesn't have to be that way Anybody can have a transformation if we create the space for that to happen So what I'm asking today is that you envision a world where men and women aren't held hostage to their pasts where misdeeds and mistakes don't define you for the rest of your life I think collectively we can create that reality and I hope you do too Thank you I don't know if you've noticed but there's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs Do they think do they feel and if so how So this afternoon in my limited time I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs both of whom have taken the command speak quite literally The first dog is the first to go and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner and the title is A Dog on His Master As young as I look I am growing older faster than he Seven to one is the ratio they tend to say Whatever the number I will pass him one day and take the lead the way I do on our walks in the woods and if this ever manages to cross his mind it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass Thank you And our next dog speaks in something called the revenant which means a spirit that comes back to visit you I am the dog you put to sleep as you like to call the needle of oblivion come back to tell you this simple thing: I never liked you When I licked your face I thought of biting off your nose When I watched you toweling yourself dry I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap I resented the way you moved your lack of animal grace the way you would sit in a chair to eat a napkin on your lap a knife in your hand I would have run away but I was too weak a trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heel and greatest of insults shake hands without a hand I admit the sight of the leash would excite me but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched You do not want to believe this but I have no reason to lie: I hated the car hated the rubber toys disliked your friends and worse your relatives The jingling of my tags drove me mad You always scratched me in the wrong place All I ever wanted from you was food and water in my bowls While you slept I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl Now I am free of the collar free of the yellow raincoat monogrammed sweater the absurdity of your lawn and that is all you need to know about this place except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner that everyone here can read and write the dogs in poetry the cats and all the others in prose Thank you Think of a hard choice you'll face in the near future It might be between two careers -- artist and accountant -- or places to live -- the city or the country -- or even between two people to marry -- you could marry Betty or you could marry Lolita Or it might be a choice about whether to have children to have an ailing parent move in with you to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold Or whether to donate your life savings to charity Chances are the hard choice you thought of was something big something momentous something that matters to you Hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand-wringing the gnashing of teeth But I think we've misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives Understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses What makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate In any easy choice one alternative is better than the other In a hard choice one alternative is better in some ways the other alternative is better in other ways and neither is better than the other overall You agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country because staying is better in some ways moving is better in others and neither is better than the other overall We shouldn't think that all hard choices are big Let's say you're deciding what to have for breakfast You could have high fiber bran cereal or a chocolate donut Suppose what matters in the choice is tastiness and healthfulness The cereal is better for you the donut tastes way better but neither is better than the other overall a hard choice Realizing that small choices can also be hard may make big hard choices seem less intractable After all we manage to figure out what to have for breakfast so maybe we can figure out whether to stay in the city or uproot for the new job in the country We also shouldn't think that hard choices are hard because we are stupid When I graduated from college I couldn't decide between two careers philosophy and law I really loved philosophy There are amazing things you can learn as a philosopher and all from the comfort of an armchair But I came from a modest immigrant family where my idea of luxury was having a pork tongue and jelly sandwich in my school lunchbox so the thought of spending my whole life sitting around in armchairs just thinking well that struck me as the height of extravagance and frivolity So I got out my yellow pad I drew a line down the middle and I tried my best to think of the reasons for and against each alternative I remember thinking to myself if only I knew what my life in each career would be like If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD of my two possible future careers I'd be set I'd compare them side by side I'd see that one was better and the choice would be easy But I got no DVD and because I couldn't figure out which was better I did what many of us do in hard choices: I took the safest option Fear of being an unemployed philosopher led me to become a lawyer and as I discovered lawyering didn't quite fit It wasn't who I was So now I'm a philosopher and I study hard choices and I can tell you that fear of the unknown while a common motivational default in dealing with hard choices rests on a misconception of them It's a mistake to think that in hard choices one alternative really is better than the other but we're too stupid to know which and since we don't know which we might as well take the least risky option Even taking two alternatives side by side with full information a choice can still be hard Hard choices are hard not because of us or our ignorance; they're hard because there is no best option Now if there's no best option if the scales don't tip in favor of one alternative over another then surely the alternatives must be equally good So maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that they're between equally good options But that can't be right If alternatives are equally good you should just flip a coin between them and it seems a mistake to think here's how you should decide between careers places to live people to marry: Flip a coin There's another reason for thinking that hard choices aren't choices between equally good options Suppose you have a choice between two jobs: you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist There are a variety of things that matter in such a choice like the excitement of the work achieving financial security having time to raise a family and so on Maybe the artist's career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression Maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation Imagine the two jobs however you like so that neither is better than the other Now suppose we improve one of them a bit Suppose the bank wooing you adds 500 dollars a month to your salary Does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one Not necessarily A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other then the two original jobs could not have been equally good If you start with two things that are equally good and you improve one of them it now must be better than the other That's not the case with options in hard choices So now we've got a puzzle We've got two jobs Neither is better than the other nor are they equally good So how are we supposed to choose Something seems to have gone wrong here Maybe the choice itself is problematic and comparison is impossible But that can't be right It's not like we're trying to choose between two things that can't be compared We're weighing the merits of two jobs after all not the merits of the number nine and a plate of fried eggs A comparison of the overall merits of two jobs is something we can make and one we often do make I think the puzzle arises because of an unreflective assumption we make about value We unwittingly assume that values like justice beauty kindness are akin to scientific quantities like length mass and weight Take any comparative question not involving value such as which of two suitcases is heavier There are only three possibilities The weight of one is greater lesser or equal to the weight of the other Properties like weight can be represented by real numbers -- one two three and so on -- and there are only three possible comparisons between any two real numbers One number is greater lesser or equal to the other Not so with values As post-Enlightenment creatures we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world but the world of value is different from the world of science The stuff of the one world can be quantified by real numbers The stuff of the other world can't We shouldn't assume that the world of is of lengths and weights of what we should do So if what matters to us -- a child's delight the love you have for your partner can't be represented by real numbers then there's no reason to believe that in choice there are only three possibilities -- that one alternative is better worse or equal to the other We need to introduce a new fourth relation beyond being better worse or equal that describes what's going on in hard choices I like to say that the alternatives are on a par When alternatives are on a par it may matter very much which you choose but one alternative isn't better than the other Rather the alternatives are in the same neighborhood of value in the same league of value while at the same time being very different in kind of value That's why the choice is hard Understanding hard choices in this way uncovers something about ourselves we didn't know Each of us has the power to create reasons Imagine a world in which every choice you face is an easy choice that is there's always a best alternative If there's a best alternative then that's the one you should choose because part of being rational is doing the better thing rather than the worse thing choosing what you have most reason to choose In such a world we'd have most reason to wear black socks instead of pink socks to eat cereal instead of donuts to live in the city rather than the country to marry Betty instead of Lolita would enslave us to reasons When you think about it it's nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do to live in the exact house you do to work at the exact job you do Instead you faced alternatives that were on a par hard choices and you made reasons for yourself to choose that hobby that house and that job When alternatives are on a par the reasons given to us the ones that determine whether we're making a mistake are silent as to what to do It's here in the space of hard choices that we get to exercise our normative power the power to create reasons for yourself to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life When we choose between options that are on a par we can do something really rather remarkable We can put our very selves behind an option Here's where I stand Here's who I am I am for banking I am for chocolate donuts This response in hard choices is a rational response but it's not dictated by reasons given to us Rather it's supported by reasons created by us When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that we wholeheartedly become the people that we are You might say that we become the authors of our own lives So when we face hard choices we shouldn't beat our head against a wall trying to figure out which alternative is better There is no best alternative Instead of looking for reasons out there we should be looking for reasons in here: Who am I to be cereal-loving country-living banker and I might decide to be a black sock-wearing urban donut-loving artist What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us Now people who don't exercise their normative powers in hard choices are drifters We all know people like that I drifted into being a lawyer I didn't put my agency behind lawyering I wasn't for lawyering Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives They let mechanisms of reward and punishment -- pats on the head fear the easiness of an option to determine what they do So the lesson of hard choices: reflect on what you can put your agency behind on what you can be for and through hard choices become that person Far from being sources of agony and dread hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out and it is here in the space of hard choices that we have the power to create reasons for ourselves to become the distinctive people that we are And that's why hard choices are not a curse but a godsend Thank you I need to start by telling you a little bit about my social life which I know may not seem relevant but it is When people meet me at parties and they find out that I'm an English professor who specializes in language they generally have one of two reactions One set of people look frightened They often say something like Oh I'd better be careful what I say I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make And then they stop talking And they wait for me to go away and talk to someone else The other set of people their eyes light up and they say You are just the person I want to talk to And then they tell me about whatever it is they think is going wrong with the English language A couple of weeks ago I was at a dinner party and the man to my right started telling me about all the ways that the Internet is degrading the English language He brought up Facebook and he said To defriend I mean is that even a real word I want to pause on that question: What makes a word real My dinner companion and I both know what the verb defriend means so when does a new word like defriend become real Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words anyway Those are the questions I want to talk about today I think most people when they say a word isn't real what they mean is it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary That of course raises a host of other questions including who writes dictionaries Before I go any further let me clarify my role in all of this I do not write dictionaries I do however collect new words much the way dictionary editors do and the great thing about being a historian of the English language is that I get to call this research When I teach the history of the English language I require that students teach me two new slang words before I will begin class Over the years I have learned some great new slang this way including hangry which -- which is when you are cranky or angry because you are hungry and adorkable which is when you are adorable in kind of a dorky way clearly terrific words that fill important gaps in the English language But how real are they if we use them primarily as slang and they don't yet appear in a dictionary With that let's turn to dictionaries I'm going to do this as a show of hands: How many of you still regularly refer to a dictionary either print or online Okay so that looks like most of you Now a second question Again a show of hands: How many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary you are using Okay many fewer At some level we know that there are human hands behind dictionaries but we're really not sure who those hands belong to I'm actually fascinated by this Even the most critical people out there tend not to be very critical about dictionaries not distinguishing among them and not asking a whole lot of questions about who edited them Just think about the phrase Look it up in the dictionary which suggests that all dictionaries are exactly the same Consider the library here on campus where you go into the reading room and there is a large unabridged dictionary up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect lying open so we can go stand before it to get answers Now don't get me wrong dictionaries are fantastic resources but they are human and they are not timeless I'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read every website they visit except dictionaries which we tend to treat as un-authored as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors what they'll tell you is they're just trying to keep up with us as we change the language They're watching what we say and what we write and trying to figure out what's going to stick and what's not going to stick They have to gamble because they want to appear cutting edge and catch the words that are going to make it such as LOL but they don't want to appear faddish and include the words that aren't going to make it and I think a word that they're watching right now is YOLO you only live once Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors and you might be surprised by one of the places where we hang out Every January we go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting where among other things we vote on the word of the year There are about 200 or 300 people who come some of the best known linguists in the United States To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting Anyone who comes can vote The most important rule is that you can vote with only one hand In the past some of the winners have been tweet in 2009 and hashtag in 2012 Chad was the word of the year in the year 2000 because who knew what a chad was before 2000 and WMD in 2002 Now we have other categories in which we vote too and my favorite category is most creative word of the year Past winners in this category have included recombobulation area which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security where you can recombobulate You can put your belt back on put your computer back in your bag And then my all-time favorite word at this vote which is multi-slacking And multi-slacking is the act of having multiple windows up on your screen so it looks like you're working when you're actually goofing around on the web Will all of these words stick Absolutely not And we have made some questionable choices for example in 2006 when the word of the year was Plutoed to mean demoted But some of the past winners now seem completely unremarkable such as app and e as a prefix and google as a verb Now a few weeks before our vote Lake Superior State University issues its list of banished words for the year What is striking about this is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap between their list and the list that we are considering for words of the year and this is because we're noticing the same thing We're noticing words that are coming into prominence It's really a question of attitude Are you bothered by language fads and language change or do you find it fun interesting something worthy of study as part of a living language The list by Lake Superior State University continues a fairly long tradition in English of complaints about new words So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875 who was very concerned that desirability is really a terrible word In 1760 Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to David Hume giving up the word colonize as bad about new pronunciations Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855 who is concerned about some fashionable pronunciations that he finds offensive and he says as if contemplate were not bad enough balcony makes me sick The word is borrowed in from Italian and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee These complaints now strike us as quaint if not downright adorkable -- -- but here's the thing: we still get quite worked up about language change I have an entire file in my office of newspaper articles which express concern about illegitimate words that should not have been included in the dictionary including LOL when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary I also have articles expressing concern about invite as a noun impact as a verb because only teeth can be impacted and incentivize is described as boorish bureaucratic misspeak Now it's not that dictionary editors ignore these kinds of attitudes about language They try to provide us some guidance about words that are considered slang or informal or offensive often through usage labels but they're in something of a bind because they're trying to describe what we do and they know that we often go to dictionaries to get information about how we should use a word well or appropriately In response the American Heritage Dictionaries include usage notes Usage notes tend to occur with words that are troublesome in one way and one of the ways that they can be troublesome is that they're changing meaning Now usage notes involve very human decisions and I think as dictionary users we're often not as aware of those human decisions as we should be To show you what I mean we'll look at an example but before we do I want to explain what the dictionary editors are trying to deal with in this usage note Think about the word peruse and how you use that word I would guess many of you are thinking of skim scan reading quickly Some of you may even have some walking involved because you're perusing grocery store shelves or something like that You might be surprised to learn that if you look in most standard dictionaries the first definition will be to read carefully or pour over American Heritage has that as the first definition They then have as the second definition skim and next to that they say usage problem And then they include a usage note which is worth looking at So here's the usage note: Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly' 。。 But the word if often used more loosely to mean simply 'to read。' 。。 Further extension of the word to mean 'to glance over skim，' has traditionally been considered an error but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming somewhat more acceptable When asked about the sentence 'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly，' 66 percent of the Usage Panel found it unacceptable in 1988 58 percent in 1999 and 48 percent in 2011 Ah the Usage Panel that trusted body of language authorities who is getting more lenient about this Now what I hope you're thinking right now is Wait who's on the Usage Panel And what should I do with their pronouncements If you look in the front matter of American Heritage Dictionaries you can actually find the names of the people on the Usage Panel But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel They include academicians journalists creative writers There's a Supreme Court justice on it and a few linguists As of 2005 the list includes me Here's what we can do for you We can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage That is and should be the extent of our authority We are not a language academy About once a year I get a ballot that asks me about whether new uses new pronunciations new meanings are acceptable Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot I listen to what other people are saying and writing I do not listen to my own likes and dislikes about the English language I will be honest with you: I do not like the word impactful but that is neither here nor there in terms of whether impactful is becoming common usage and becoming more acceptable in written prose So to be responsible what I do is go look at usage which often involves going to look at online databases such as Google Books Well if you look for impactful in Google Books here is what you find Well it sure looks like impactful is proving useful for a certain number of writers and has become more and more useful over the last 20 years Now there are going to be changes that all of us don't like in the language There are going to be changes where you think Really Does the language have to change that way What I'm saying is we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble It's not It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it In retrospect we think it's fascinating that the word nice used to mean silly and that the word decimate used to mean to kill one in every 10 We think that Ben Franklin was being silly to worry about notice as a verb Well you know what for worrying about impact as a verb and invite as a noun The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up Language just doesn't work that way I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating just the way dictionary editors do I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust So how does a word get into a dictionary It gets in because we use it and we keep using it and dictionary editors are paying attention to us If you're thinking But that lets all of us decide what words mean I would say Yes it does and it always has Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means it's real That word might be slangy that word might be informal that word might be a word that you think is illogical or unnecessary but that word that we're using that word is real Thank you In the middle of my Ph。D。 I was hopelessly stuck Every research direction that I tried led to a dead end It seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working I felt like a pilot flying through the mist and I lost all sense of direction I stopped shaving I couldn't get out of bed in the morning I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about because in science we just learn about the results not the process And so obviously I couldn't be a scientist But I had enough support and I made it through and discovered something new about nature This is an amazing feeling of calmness being the only person in the world who knows a new law of nature And I started the second project in my Ph。D and it happened again I got stuck and I made it through And I started thinking maybe there's a pattern here I asked the other graduate students and they said Yeah that's exactly what happened to us except nobody told us about it We'd all studied science as if it's a series of logical steps between question and answer but doing research is nothing like that At the same time I was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor So physics by day and by night laughing jumping singing playing my guitar Improvisation theater just like science goes into the unknown because you have to make a scene onstage without a director without a script without having any idea what you'll portray or what the other characters will do But unlike science in improvisation theater they tell you from day one what's going to happen to you when you get onstage You're going to fail miserably You're going to get stuck And we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place For example we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle and each person had to do the world's worst tap dance and everybody else applauded and cheered you on supporting you onstage When I became a professor and had to guide my own students through their research projects I realized again I don't know what to do I'd studied thousands of hours of physics biology chemistry but not one hour not one concept on how to mentor how to guide someone to go together into the unknown about motivation So I turned to improvisation theater and I told my students from day one what's going to happen when you start research and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like Because you see whenever people do anything for example if I want to touch this blackboard my brain first builds up a schema a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before I even start moving my hand and if I get blocked if my schema doesn't match reality that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance That's why your schemas had better match reality But if you believe the way science is taught and if you believe textbooks you're liable to have the following schema of research If A is the question and B is the answer then research is a direct path The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work or a student gets depressed and causes tremendous stress And that's why I teach my students a more realistic schema Here's an example where things don't match your schema So I teach my students a different schema If A is the question B is the answer stay creative in the cloud and you start going and experiments don't work experiments don't work experiments don't work experiments don't work until you reach a place linked with negative emotions where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet And I call this place the cloud Now you can be lost in the cloud for a day a week a month a year a whole career but sometimes if you're lucky enough and you have enough support you can see in the materials at hand or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud a new answer C and you decide to go for it And experiments don't work experiments don't work but you get there and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C which is a great way to communicate but as long as you don't forget the path that brought you there Now this cloud is an inherent part of research an inherent part of our craft because the cloud stands guard at the boundary between the known and the unknown because in order to discover something truly new at least one of your basic assumptions has to change and that means that in science we do something quite heroic Every day we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud Now notice that I put B in the land of the known because we knew about it in the beginning but C is always more interesting and more important than B So B is essential in order to get going but C is much more profound and that's the amazing thing about resesarch Now just knowing that word the cloud has been transformational in my research group because students come to me and say Uri I'm in the cloud and I say Great you must be feeling miserable But I'm kind of happy because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new since the way our mind works it's just knowing that the cloud is normal it's essential and in fact beautiful we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me And as a mentor I know what to do which is to step up my support for the student because research in psychology shows that if you're feeling fear and despair your mind narrows down to very safe and conservative ways of thinking If you'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud you need other emotions -- solidarity support hope that come with your connection from somebody else so like in improvisation theater in science it's best to walk into the unknown together So knowing about the cloud you also learn from improvisation theater a very effective way to have conversations inside the cloud It's based on the central principle of improvisation theater so here improvisation theater came to my help again It's called saying Yes and That means accepting the offers and building on them saying Yes and For example if one actor says Here is a pool of water and the other actor says No that's just a stage the improvisation is over It's dead and everybody feels frustrated That's called blocking If you're not mindful of communications scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking Saying Yes and sounds like this Here is a pool of water Yeah let's jump in Look there's a whale Let's grab it by its tail It's pulling us to the moon So saying Yes and bypasses our inner critic We all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say so people don't think that we're obscene or crazy or unoriginal of appearing unoriginal Saying Yes and bypasses the critic and unlocks hidden voices of creativity you didn't even know that you had and they often carry the answer about the cloud So you see knowing about the cloud and about saying Yes and made my lab very creative Students started playing off of each others' ideas and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology For example we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells and we said We are deeply in the cloud and we had a playful conversation where my student Shai Shen Orr said Let's just draw this on a piece of paper this network and instead of saying But we've done that so many times and it doesn't work I said Yes and let's use a very big piece of paper and then Ron Milo said Let's use a gigantic architect's blueprint kind of paper and I know where to print it and we printed out the network and looked at it and that's where we made our most important discovery that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a stained glass window We call them network motifs and they're the elementary circuits that help us understand the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms including our body Soon enough after this I started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world but the knowledge about the cloud and saying Yes and just stayed within my own lab because you see in science we don't talk about the process anything subjective or emotional We talk about the results So there was no way to talk about it in conferences That was unthinkable And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck without even having a word to describe what they're seeing and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths their science didn't reach its full potential and they were miserable I thought that's the way it is I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible and if everybody else does the same science will eventually become more and more better and better when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science And she asked Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science It's not by chance It's a matter of values You see science seeks knowledge that's objective and rational That's the beautiful thing about science But we also have a cultural myth that the doing of science what we do every day to get that knowledge is also only objective and rational like Mr Spock And when you label something as objective and rational automatically the other side the subjective and emotional or anti-science or threatening to science and we just don't talk about it And when I heard that that science has a culture everything clicked into place for me because if science has a culture culture can be changed and I can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever I could And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference I talked about my science and then I talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them and I looked at the audience and they were cold They couldn't hear what I was saying in the context of a 10 back-to-back PowerPoint presentation conference And I tried again and again conference after conference but I wasn't getting through I was in the cloud And eventually I managed to get out the cloud Since then every conference I go to I give a science talk and a second special talk called Love and fear in the lab and I start it off by doing a song about scientists' greatest fear which is that we work hard we discover something new and somebody else publishes it before we do We call it being scooped and being scooped feels horrible It makes us afraid to talk to each other which is no fun and to learn from each other and so I do a blues song which called Scooped Again and I ask the audience to be my backup singers and I tell them Your text is 'Scoop Scoop。' It sounds like this: Scoop scoop Sounds like this I've been scooped again Scoop Scoop And then we go for it I've been scooped again Scoop Scoop I've been scooped again Scoop Scoop I've been scooped again Scoop Scoop I've been scooped again Scoop Scoop Oh mama can't you feel my pain Heavens help me I've been scooped again Thank you Thank you for your backup singing So everybody starts laughing starts breathing notices that there's other scientists around them with shared issues and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things that go on in research It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted Finally we can talk about this in a scientific conference And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they're mentoring as they're going into the unknown and even started courses about the process of doing science about going into the unknown together and many other things So my vision is that just like every scientist knows the word atom that matter is made out of atoms every scientist would know the words like the cloud saying Yes and and science will become much more creative make many many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all and would also be much more playful And what I might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can't solve in work or in life there's a word for what you're going to see: the cloud And you can go through the cloud with someone who is your source of support to say Yes and to your ideas to help you say Yes and to your own ideas to increase the chance that through the wisps of the cloud you'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your unexpected discovery Thank you It was less than a year after September 11 and I was at the Chicago Tribune writing about shootings and murders and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed I had done some activism in college so I decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing I thought it would be a safe way to do something positive but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever and we were all arrested Police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence My charges were dismissed but a few weeks later two FBI agents knocked on my door and they told me that unless I helped them by spying on protest groups they would put me on a domestic terrorist list I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch but I was terrified and when my fear subsided I became obsessed with finding out how this happened how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the FBI's number one domestic terrorism threat A few years later I was invited to testify before Congress about my reporting and I told lawmakers that while everybody is talking about going green to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales These are everyday people like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular so in 1985 their opponents made up a new word eco-terrorist to shift how we view them They just made it up Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits including members of Congress Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House They were praising Dr King as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment Supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists: the vandals the arsonists the radicals But right now companies like TransCanada are briefing police in presentations like this one as terrorists The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism are not about violence they're about public relations Today in multiple countries corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism The first of these ag-gag prosecutions as they're called was a young woman named Amy Meyer and Amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street And Amy did what any of us would: She filmed it and within 24 hours it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges But apparently even exposing stuff like that is a threat Through the Freedom of Information Act I learned that the counter-terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one They even included this nice little write-up of my book They described it as compelling and well-written Blurb on the next book right The point of all of this is to make us afraid but as a journalist I have an unwavering faith in the power of education Our best weapon is sunlight Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he's a man and not a piano key Over and over throughout history people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent It's time we strike a new note Thank you Four years ago a security researcher or as most people would call it a hacker found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him His name was Barnaby Jack and this technique was later called jackpotting in his honor I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge his research instead He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution And I feel the same way That's why I'm here today We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have They scare us But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all So I am here today because I think we need hackers and in fact they just might be the immune system for the information age Sometimes they make us sick but they also find those hidden threats in our world and they make us fix it I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk so let me save you the effort In true TED fashion here is my most embarrassing picture But it would be difficult for you to find me in it because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join This is who I was but this is who I wanted to be: Angelina Jolie She portrayed Acid Burn in the '95 film Hackers She was pretty and she could rollerblade but being a hacker that made her powerful And I wanted to be just like her so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code I didn't really know what it did but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that Open Sesame It was a simple trick and I was just a script kiddie back then but to me that trick it felt like this like I had discovered limitless potential at my fingertips This is the rush of power that hackers feel It's geeks just like me discovering they have access to superpower one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellect but thankfully no radioactive spiders But with great power comes great responsibility and you all like to think that if we had such powers we would only use them for good But what if you could read your ex's emails or add a couple zeros to your bank account What would you do then Indeed many hackers do not resist those temptations and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud malware or plain old identity theft which is a serious issue But there are other hackers hackers who just like to break things and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers no password needed He reported it to the company of course but they ignored his report Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature not a bug until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files But they didn't steal anything They left a note: Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world Here's what you should do to fix it We hope we helped By getting into people's files like that yeah they broke the law but they also forced that company to fix their product Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community and it is controversial but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day This is what Khalil did Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code Unfortunately due to some miscommunications his report was not acknowledged Frustrated with the exchange he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall This got their attention all right and they fixed the bug but because he hadn't reported it properly he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries Thankfully for Khalil a group of hackers were watching out for him In fact they raised more than 13，000 dollars to reward him for this discovery raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing But I think there's a greater story here still Even companies founded by hackers like Facebook was still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers And so for more conservative organizations it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it But I think it's worth the effort because the alternative to blindly fight all hackers is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge These are things that will come back and bite you It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web especially in times like this like today even as governments and corporates fight to control the Internet I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition its last line of defense even perhaps someone like Anonymous the leading brand of global hacktivism This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers It turns out the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide Australia This proved that Anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world Since then they've gone after many targets They've uncovered corruption abuse They've hacked popes and politicians and I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents I think that like Robin Hood they are in the business of redistribution but what they are after isn't your money It's not your documents It's your attention They grab the spotlight for causes they support forcing us to take note acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of but perhaps we should be They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists and I cannot justify their illegal means but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all The reality is hackers can do a lot more than break things They can bring people together And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it just watch what happens when you try to shut the Internet down This took place in Egypt in January 2011 and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented and for hackers it made it personal Hackers like the Telecomix group were already active on the ground helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio It was high season for low tech which the government couldn't block but when the Net went completely down Telecomix brought in the big guns They found European service providers that still had 20-year-old analog dial-up access infrastructure They opened up 300 of those lines for Egyptians to use serving slow but sweet Internet connection for Egyptians This worked It worked so well in fact one guy even used it to download an episode of How I Met Your Mother But while Egypt's future is still uncertain when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines and Anonymous they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website But with this sort of power it really depends on where you stand because one man's hero can be another's villain and so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime They've taken down multiple high-profile targets in the past few years including the Associated Press's Twitter account in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House injuring President Obama This tweet was fake of course but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not and a lot of people lost a lot of money This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America from Europe to the United States hackers are a force for social political and military influence As individuals or in groups volunteers or military conflicts there are hackers everywhere They come from all walks of life ethnicities ideologies and genders I might add They are now shaping the world's stage Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century This is because access to information is a critical currency of power one which governments would like to control a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs a thing they need hackers for by the way And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large Two years ago I saw General Keith Alexander He's the NSA director and U。S cyber commander but instead of his four star general uniform he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt This was at DEF CON the world's largest hacker conference Perhaps like me General Alexander didn't see 12，000 criminals that day in Vegas I think he saw untapped potential In fact he was there to give a hiring pitch In this room right here he said is the talent our nation needs Well hackers in the back row replied Then stop arresting us Indeed for years hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence but in light of what we know now who is more watchful of our online world The rules of the game are not that clear anymore but hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable of challenging overreaching governments and data-hoarding corporates on their own playing field To me that represents hope For the past three decades hackers have done a lot of things but they have also impacted civil liberties innovation and Internet freedom so I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys how can they be the heroes too My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers: They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it and so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world They make us they force us to fix things or demand something better and I think we need them to do just that because after all it is not information that wants to be free it's us Thank you very much Thank you Hack the planet Election night 2008 was a night that tore me in half It was the night that Barack Obama was elected One hundred and forty-three years after the end of slavery and 43 years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act an African-American was elected president Many of us never thought that this was possible until the moment that it happened And in many ways it was the climax of the black civil rights movement in the United States I was in California that night which was ground zero at the time for another movement: the marriage equality movement Gay marriage was on the ballot in the form of Proposition 8 and as the election returns started to come in it became clear that the right for same sex couples to marry which had recently been granted by the California courts So on the same night that Barack Obama won his historic presidency the lesbian and gay community suffered one of our most painful defeats And then it got even worse Pretty much immediately African-Americans started to be blamed for the passage of Proposition 8 This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said that blacks had voted for the measure by something like 70 percent This turned out not to be true but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in and was grabbed on by the media I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage I listened to some gay commentator say that the African-American community was notoriously homophobic and now that civil rights had been achieved for us we wanted to take away other people's rights There were even reports of racist epithets being thrown at some of the participants of the gay rights rallies that took place after the election And on the other side some African-Americans dismissed or ignored homophobia that was indeed real in our community And others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and once again the sinking feeling that two minority groups were competing with each other instead of supporting each other overwhelmed and frankly pissed me off Now I'm a documentary filmmaker so after going through my pissed off stage and yelling at the television and radio my next instinct was to make a movie And what guided me in making this film was how was this happening How was it that the gay rights movement was being pitted against the civil rights movement And this wasn't just an abstract question I'm a beneficiary of both movements so this was actually personal But then something else happened after that election in 2008 The march towards gay equality accelerated at a pace and is still reshaping our laws and our policies our institutions and our entire country And so it started to become increasingly clear to me that this pitting of the two movements against each other actually didn't make sense and that they were in fact much much more interconnected and that in fact some of the way that the gay rights movement has been able to make such incredible gains so quickly is that it's used some of the same tactics and strategies that were first laid down by the civil rights movement Let's just look at a few of these strategies First off it's really interesting to see to actually visually see how quick the gay rights movement has made its gains if you look at a few of the major events on a timeline of both freedom movements Now there are tons of milestones in the civil rights movement but the first one we're going to start with is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott This was a protest campaign against Montgomery Alabama's segregation on their public transit system and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person The campaign lasted a year and it galvanized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it And I call this strategy the I'm tired of your foot on my neck strategy So gays and lesbians have been in society since societies began but up until the mid-20th century homosexual acts were still illegal in most states So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott It's known as Stonewall in 1969 and it's where a group of LGBT patrons fought back against police beatings at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked three days of rioting Incidentally black and latino LGBT folks were at the forefront of this rebellion and it's a really interesting example of the intersection of our struggles against racism homophobia gender identity and police brutality After Stonewall happened gay liberation groups sprang up all over the country and the modern gay rights movement as we know it took off So the next moment to look at on the timeline is the 1963 March on Washington This was a seminal event in the civil rights movement and it's where African-Americans called for both civil and economic justice And it's of course where Martin Luther King delivered his famous I have a dream speech but what's actually less known is that this march was organized by a man named Bayard Rustin Bayard was an out gay man and he's considered one of the most brilliant strategists of the civil rights movement He later in his life became a fierce advocate of LGBT rights as well and his life is testament to the intersection of the struggles The March on Washington is one of the high points of the movement and it's where there was a fervent belief that African-Americans too could be a part of American democracy I call this strategy the We are visible and many in numbers strategy Some early gay activists were actually directly inspired by the march and some had taken part Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said We marched with Martin Luther King seven of us from the Mattachine Society -- which was an early gay rights organization and from that moment on we had our own dream about a gay rights march of similar proportions Several years later a series of marches took place each one gaining the momentum of the gay freedom struggle The first one was in 1979 and the second one took place in 1987 The third one was held in 1993 Almost a million people showed up and people were so energized and excited by what had taken place they went back to their own communities and started their own political and social organizations further increasing the visibility of the movement The day of that march October 11 was then declared National Coming Out Day and is still celebrated all over the world These marches set the groundwork for the historic changes that we see happening And lastly the Loving strategy The name speaks for itself In 1967 the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v Virginia and invalidated all laws that prohibited interracial marriage This is considered one of the Supreme Court's landmark civil rights cases In 1996 President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act known as DOMA and that made the federal government only have to recognize marriages between a man and a woman In United States v Windsor a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor sued the federal government when she was forced to pay estate taxes on her deceased wife's property something that heterosexual couples don't have to do And as the case wound its way through the lower courts the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013 the Supreme Court agreed and DOMA was thrown out It was incredible But the gay marriage movement has been making gains for years now To date 17 states have passed laws allowing marriage equality It's become the de facto battle for gay equality and it seems like daily laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts even in places like Texas and Utah which no one saw coming So a lot has changed since that night in 2008 when I felt torn in half I did go on to make that film It's a documentary film and it's called The New Black and it looks at how the African-American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights And I wanted to capture some of this incredible change that was happening and as luck or politics would have it another marriage battle started gearing up this time in Maryland where African-Americans make up 30 percent of the electorate So this tension between gay rights and civil rights started to bubble up once again and I was lucky enough to capture how some people were making the connection between the movements this time This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes and Samantha Masters two characters in the film as they hit the streets of Baltimore and try to convince potential voters Samantha Masters: That's what's up man this is a righteous man over here Okay are you registered to vote No Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay How old are you 21 KTH: 21 You gotta get registered to vote We got to get you registered to vote I ain't voting on no gay shit SM: Okay why What's up I ain't with that SM: That's not cool What made you be gay SM: So what made you be straight So what made you be straight You can't answer that question KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you but I know that because a black man like yourself stood up for a woman like me I know that I've got the same opportunities So you as a black man have the opportunity to stand up for somebody else Whether you're gay or not these are your brothers and sisters out here and they need you to represent Who is you to tell somebody who they can't have sex with who they can't be with They ain't got that power Nobody has that power to say you can't marry that young lady Who has that power Nobody SM: But you know what Our state has put the power in your hands and so what we need you to do is vote for you gonna vote for 6 I got you SM: Vote for 6 okay I got you KSM: All right do y'all need community service hours You do All right you can always volunteer with us to get community service hours Y'all want to do that We feed you We bring you pizza Yoruba Richen: Thank you What's amazing to me about that clip that we just captured as we were filming is it really shows how Karess understands the history of the civil rights movement but she's not restricted by it She doesn't just limit it to black people She sees it as a blueprint for expanding rights to gays and lesbians Maybe because she's younger she's like 25 she's able to do this a little bit more easily but the fact is that Maryland voters did pass that marriage equality amendment and in fact it was the first time that marriage equality was directly voted on and passed by the voters African-Americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded It was a complete turnaround from that night in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed It was and feels monumental We in the LGBT community have gone from being a pathologized and reviled and criminalized group to being seen as part of the great human quest for dignity and equality We've gone from having to hide our sexuality in order to maintain our jobs and our families to literally getting a place at the table with the president and a shout out at his second inauguration I just want to read what he said at that inauguration: We the people declare today that the most evident of truths that all of us are created equal It is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall Now we know that everything is not perfect especially when you look at what's happening with the LGBT rights issue internationally when our president puts the gay freedom struggle in the context of the other great freedom struggles of our time: the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement His statement demonstrates not only the interconnectedness of those movements but how each one borrowed and was inspired by the other So just as Martin Luther King learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics of civil disobedience and nonviolence which became a bedrock of the civil rights movement the gay rights movement saw what worked in the civil rights movement and they used some of those same strategies and tactics to make gains at an even quicker pace for the relative quick progress of the gay rights movement Whereas a lot of us continue to still live in racially segregated spaces LGBT folks we are everywhere We are in urban communities and rural communities communities of color immigrant communities churches and mosques and synagogues We are your mothers and brothers and sisters and sons And when someone that you love or a family member comes out it may be easier to support their quest for equality And in fact the gay rights movement asks us to support justice and equality from a space of love That may be the biggest greatest gift that the movement has given us It calls on us to access that which is most universal and most intimate: and our neighbor I just want to end with a quote by one of our greatest freedom fighters who's no longer with us Nelson Mandela Nelson Mandela led South Africa after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid and out of the ashes of that legalized racial discrimination he led South Africa to become the first country in the world to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation within its constitution Mandela said For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others So as these movements continue on and as freedom struggles around the world continue on let's remember that not only are they interconnected but they must support and enhance each other for us to be truly victorious Thank you Even nature's most disgusting creatures have important secrets but who would want a swarm of cockroaches coming towards them Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments Remarkably cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain When we put a jet pack on them or give them a perturbation like an earthquake we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower They can go over complex terrain like grass no problem and not get destabilized We discovered a new behavior where because of their shape they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass Robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure Here's a new behavior we've discovered The animals rapidly invert and disappear in less than 150 milliseconds you never see them using the same structures that they use to run their legs They can run upside down very rapidly on rods branches and wires and if you perturb one of those branches They can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet And they have nearly unlimited maneuverability with that same structure and unprecedented access to a variety of different areas They have wings for flying when they get warm but they use those same wings to flip over if they get destabilized Very effective Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe This is the foot of a cockroach It has spines gluey pads and claws but if you take off those feet they can still go over rough terrain like the bottom video that you see without hardly slowing down Extraordinary They can run up mesh without their feet Here's an animal using a normal alternating tripod: three legs three legs three legs but in nature the insects often have lost their legs Here's one moving with two middle legs gone It can even lose three legs in a tripod and adopt a new gait a hopping gait And I point out that all of these videos are slowed down 20 times so they're actually really fast when you see this Robust systems are also damage resistant Here's an animal climbing up a wall It looks like a rapid smooth vertical climb but when you slow it down you see something very different Here's what they do They intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall so they don't slow down and can transition up it in 75 milliseconds And they can do this in part because they have extraordinary exoskeletons And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach You see these plates and you see the compliant membrane My engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton you laser cut it laminate it and you fold it up into a robot And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes These robots called DASH for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod are highly compliant robots of these features They're certainly incredibly damage resistant They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches So they can use their smart compliant body to transition up a wall in a very simple way They even have some of the beginnings of the rapid inversion behavior where they disappear Now we want to know why they can go anywhere We discovered that they can go through three-millimeter gaps the height of two pennies two stacked pennies and when they do this they can actually run through those confined spaces at high speeds although you never see it To understand it better we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton and showed that they can compress their body by over 40 percent We put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces 800 times their body weight and after this they can fly and run absolutely normally So you never know where curiosity-based research will lead and someday you may want a swarm of cockroach-inspired robots to come at you Thank you Let me tell you a story It goes back 200 million years It's a story of the neocortex which means new rind So in these early mammals because only mammals have a neocortex rodent-like creatures It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin and was a thin covering around their walnut-sized brain but it was capable of a new type of thinking Rather than the fixed behaviors that non-mammalian animals have it could invent new behaviors So a mouse is escaping a predator its path is blocked it'll try to invent a new solution That may work it may not but if it does it will remember that and have a new behavior and that can actually spread virally through the rest of the community Another mouse watching this could say Hey that was pretty clever going around that rock and it could adopt a new behavior as well Non-mammalian animals couldn't do any of those things They had fixed behaviors Now they could learn a new behavior but not in the course of one lifetime In the course of maybe a thousand lifetimes it could evolve a new fixed behavior That was perfectly okay 200 million years ago The environment changed very slowly It could take 10，000 years for there to be a significant environmental change and during that period of time it would evolve a new behavior Now that went along fine but then something happened Sixty-five million years ago there was a sudden violent change to the environment We call it the Cretaceous extinction event That's when the dinosaurs went extinct that's when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche and to anthropomorphize biological evolution said Hmm this neocortex is pretty good stuff and it began to grow it And mammals got bigger their brains got bigger at an even faster pace and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out it's about the size of a table napkin and it's still a thin structure It's about the thickness of a table napkin But it has so many convolutions and ridges it's now 80 percent of our brain and that's where we do our thinking and it's the great sublimator We still have that old brain that provides our basic drives and motivations but I may have a drive for conquest and that'll be sublimated by the neocortex into writing a poem or inventing an app or giving a TED Talk and it's really the neocortex that's where the action is Fifty years ago I wrote a paper describing how I thought the brain worked and I described it as a series of modules Each module could do things with a pattern It could learn a pattern It could remember a pattern It could implement a pattern And these modules were organized in hierarchies and we created that hierarchy with our own thinking And there was actually very little to go on 50 years ago It led me to meet President Johnson I've been thinking about this for 50 years and a year and a half ago I came out with the book How To Create A Mind which has the same thesis but now there's a plethora of evidence The amount of data we're getting about the brain from neuroscience is doubling every year Spatial resolution of brainscanning of all types is doubling every year We can now see inside a living brain and see individual interneural connections connecting in real time firing in real time We can see your brain create your thoughts We can see your thoughts create your brain which is really key to how it works So let me describe briefly how it works I've actually counted these modules We have about 300 million of them and we create them in these hierarchies I'll give you a simple example I've got a bunch of modules that can recognize the crossbar to a capital A and that's all they care about A beautiful song can play a pretty girl could walk by they don't care but they see a crossbar to a capital A they get very excited and they say crossbar and they put out a high probability on their output axon That goes to the next level and these layers are organized in conceptual levels Each is more abstract than the next one so the next one might say capital A That goes up to a higher level that might say Apple Information flows down also If the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L it'll think to itself Hmm I think an E is probably likely and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying Be on the lookout for an E I think one might be coming The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing could be an E Ordinarily you wouldn't think so but we're expecting an E it's good enough and yeah I've seen an E and then apple says Yeah I've seen an Apple Go up another five levels and you're now at a pretty high level of this hierarchy and stretch down into the different senses and you may have a module that sees a certain fabric hears a certain voice quality smells a certain perfume and will say My wife has entered the room Go up another 10 levels and now you're at a very high level You're probably in the frontal cortex and you'll have modules that say That was ironic That's funny She's pretty You might think that those are more sophisticated but actually what's more complicated is the hierarchy beneath them There was a 16-year-old girl she had brain surgery and she was conscious because the surgeons wanted to talk to her You can do that because there's no pain receptors in the brain And whenever they stimulated particular very small points on her neocortex shown here in red she would laugh So at first they thought they were triggering some kind of laugh reflex but no they quickly realized they had found the points in her neocortex that detect humor and she just found everything hilarious whenever they stimulated these points You guys are so funny just standing around was the typical comment and they weren't funny not while doing surgery So how are we doing today Well computers are actually beginning to master human language with techniques that are similar to the neocortex I actually described the algorithm which is similar to something called a hierarchical hidden Markov model something I've worked on since the '90s Jeopardy is a very broad natural language game and Watson got a higher score than the best two players combined It got this query correct: A long tiresome speech delivered by a frothy pie topping and it quickly responded What is a meringue harangue And Jennings and the other guy didn't get that It's a pretty sophisticated example of computers actually understanding human language and it actually got its knowledge by reading Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias Five to 10 years from now search engines will actually be based on not just looking for combinations of words and links but actually understanding reading for understanding the billions of pages on the web and in books So you'll be walking along and Google will pop up and say You know Mary you expressed concern to me a month ago that your glutathione supplement wasn't getting past the blood-brain barrier Well new research just came out 13 seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione Let me summarize it for you Twenty years from now we'll have nanobots because another exponential trend is the shrinking of technology They'll go into our brain through the capillaries and basically connect our neocortex to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud providing an extension of our neocortex Now today I mean you have a computer in your phone but if you need 10，000 computers for a few seconds to do a complex search you can access that for a second or two in the cloud In the 2030s if you need some extra neocortex you'll be able to connect to that in the cloud directly from your brain So I'm walking along and I say Oh there's Chris Anderson He's coming my way I'd better think of something clever to say I've got three seconds My 300 million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it I need a billion more I'll be able to access that in the cloud And our thinking then will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological thinking but the non-biological portion is subject to my law of accelerating returns It will grow exponentially And remember what happens the last time we expanded our neocortex That was two million years ago when we became humanoids and developed these large foreheads Other primates have a slanted brow They don't have the frontal cortex But the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different It's a quantitative expansion of neocortex but that additional quantity of thinking was the enabling factor for us to take and art and science and technology and TED conferences No other species has done that And so over the next few decades we're going to do it again We're going to again expand our neocortex only this time we won't be limited by a fixed architecture of enclosure It'll be expanded without limit That additional quantity will again be the enabling factor for another qualitative leap in culture and technology Thank you very much It's all there in gospels A Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects But her mind is awhirl When she finds the tomb empty Straw had been rolled Not a sign of a corpse In the dark and the cold When she reaches the door Sees an unholy sight There's a solitary figure and a halo of light He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill In an Almighty hurry Aye but she might catch him still Tell me where are you gone Lord And why in such haste Oh don't hinder me woman I've no time to waste For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon And I have to be there before daybreak Oh I cannot be missing The lads'll expect me Why else would the Good Lord Himself resurrect me For nothing'll stop me I have to prevail Through the teeth of this tempest In the mouth of a gale May the angels protect me And the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails So I was born and raised in a little town on the northeast coast of England Some of my earliest memories blocking the end of my street as well as the sun for a lot of the year Every morning as a child I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill to work in the shipyard I'd watch those same men walking back home every night the most pleasant place to live next door to The shipyard was noisy dangerous highly toxic with an appalling health and safety record Despite that the men and women who worked on those ships were extraordinarily proud of the work they did and justifiably so My grandfather had been a shipwright and as a child as there were few other jobs in the town I would wonder with some anxiety I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be I had other dreams not necessarily practical ones but at the age of eight I was bequeathed a guitar It was a battered old thing with five rusty strings and was out of tune but quickly I learned to play it and realized that I'd found a friend for life an accomplice a co-conspirator in my plan to escape from this surreal industrial landscape Well they say if you dream something hard enough it will come to pass Either that or I was extremely lucky but this was my dream I dreamt I would leave this town and just like those ships once they were launched I'd never come back I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs to vast numbers of people all over the world that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money that I'd become famous buy a big house in the country have rooms full of Grammy Awards platinum discs and what have you So far so good right And then one day the songs stopped coming and while you've suffered from periods of writer's block before albeit briefly this is something chronic with very little to show for your efforts No songs So you start asking yourself questions What have I done to offend the gods that they would abandon me so Is the gift of songwriting taken away as easily as it seems to have been bestowed Or perhaps there's a more -- a deeper psychological reason It was always a Faustian pact anyway You're rewarded for revealing your innermost thoughts your private emotions on the page for the entertainment of others for the analysis the scrutiny of others and perhaps you've given enough of your privacy away And yet if you look at your work could it be argued that your best work wasn't about you at all it was about somebody else when you sidestepped your own ego and you stopped telling your story but told someone else's story someone perhaps without a voice where empathetically you stood in his shoes Well they say write what you know If you can't write about yourself anymore then who do you write about So it's ironic that the landscape I'd worked so hard to escape from and the community that I'd more or less abandoned and exiled myself from should be the very landscape the very community I would have to return to to find my missing muse And as soon as I did that as soon as I decided to honor the community I came from and tell their story that the songs started to come thick and fast I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting a torrent of ideas of characters of voices of verses couplets entire songs almost formed whole materialized in front of me as if they'd been bottled up inside me for many many years One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names of people I'd known and they become characters in a kind of three-dimensional drama This is Jackie White He's the foreman of the shipyard My name is Jackie White and I'm foreman of the yard and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside I'm as hard as iron plate woe betide you if you're late when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide Now you can die and hope for heaven but you need to work your shift for Her Majesty the Queen And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard Steel in the stockyard iron in the soul Would conjure up a ship Where there used to be a hull And we don't know what we'll do If this yard gets sold For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard So having decided to write about other people instead of myself a further irony is that sometimes you reveal more about yourself than you'd ever intended This song is called Dead Man's Boots which describes how difficult it is to get a job; if somebody else died Or perhaps your father could finagle you an apprenticeship at the age of 15 But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued as controlling can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy You see these work boots in my hands They'll probably fit you now my son Take them they're a gift from me Why don't you try them on It would do your old man good to see You walking in these boots one day And take your place among the men Who work upon the slipway These dead man's boots though they're old and curled When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world And it's time for a man to put down roots And walk to the river in his old man's boots He said I'm dying son and asking That you do one final thing for me You're barely but a sapling and you think that you're a tree If you need a seed to prosper You must first put down some roots Just one foot then the other in These dead man's boots These dead man's boots though they're old and curled When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world And it's time for a man to put down roots And walk to the river in his old man's boots I said Why in the hell would I do that Why would I agree When his hand was all that I'd received As far as I remember It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness Up to then you see I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place When I came of age September These dead man's boots know their way down the hill They could walk there themselves and they probably will I've plenty of choices I've plenty other routes And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left Or a broken pot to piss in He wanted this same thing for me Was that his final wish He said What the hell are you gonna do I said Anything but this These dead man's boots know their way down the hill They can walk there themselves and they probably will But they won't walk with me 'cause I'm off the other way I've had it up to here I'm gonna have my say When all you've got left is that cross on the wall I want nothing from you I want nothing at all Not a pension nor a pittance when your whole life is through Get this through your head I'm nothing like you I'm done with all the arguments there'll be no more disputes And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots Thank you So whenever they'd launch a big ship on the train to make a speech break a bottle of champagne over the bows launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea Occasionally on a really important ship they'd get a member of the royal family to come Duke of Edinburgh Princess Anne or somebody And you have to remember it wasn't that long ago that the royal family in England were considered to have magical healing powers Sick children were held up in crowds to try and touch the cloak of the king or the queen to cure them of some terrible disease So it's a launch day it's a Saturday and my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best I'm not very happy with her and at the top of the hill there's a motorcycle cortege appears In the middle of the motorcycles there's a big black Rolls-Royce Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother This is a big deal at a stately pace down my street and as it approaches my house I start to wave my flag vigorously and there is the Queen Mother I see her and she seems to see me She acknowledges me She waves and she smiles And I wave my flag even more vigorously We're having a moment me and the Queen Mother And then she's gone Well I wasn't cured of anything It was the opposite actually I was infected I was infected with an idea I don't belong in this street I want to be in that car I want a life beyond this town I want a life that's out of the ordinary It's my right And so here I am at TED I suppose to tell that story and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link between storytelling and community between community and art between community and economics It's my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted cruel The fact is whether you're a rock star or a tribesman in the upper Amazon or the queen of England at the end of the day we're all in the same boat Aye the footmen are frantic in their indignation You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station Where the porters surprised by her lack of royal baggage Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility And there's none of them famous for their compatibility There's a fight over seats I beg pardon Your Grace But you'll find that one's mine so get back in your place Aye but where are they going All the porters debate Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide And they've come from all over from far and from wide There's the old Dalai Lama And the pontiff of Rome Every palace in Europe and there's nay bugger home There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails Well they haven't got tickets Come now it's just a detail There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail When the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails And whatever you'd promised Whatever you've done And whatever the station in life you've become In the name of the Father in the name of the Son And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun When the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails

father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing and as I took the history it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor retinoblastoma and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son That moment changed my life It propelled me to go on and to co-lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene and in the intervening decades since then there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases In fact for thousands of human traits a molecular basis that's known for that and for thousands of people every day there's information that they gain about the risk of going on to get this disease or that disease At the same time if you ask Has that impacted the efficiency how we've been able to develop drugs the answer is not really If you look at the cost of developing drugs how that's done it basically hasn't budged that And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat And there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens One of them is it's early days We're just learning the words the fragments the letters in the genetic code We don't know how to read the sentences We don't know how to follow the narrative The other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function and it's actually really hard to develop drugs that restore function But today I want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question and ask What happens if we're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context We do a lot of studying of those who are sick and building up long lists of altered components But maybe if what we're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention maybe what we should be doing is studying those who don't get sick Maybe we should be studying those that are well A vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor They're not going to help us There are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk they're going to go on to get some symptom That's not what we're looking for What we're asking and looking for is are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the risk that normally would cause a disease but something in them something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms If you're going to do a study like that you can imagine you'd like to look at lots and lots of people We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study and we realized that actually one way to think of this is let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age and let's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids They might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease but not necessarily And let's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases Now some of you I can see you putting your hands up going Uh a little odd What's your evidence that this could be feasible I want to give you two examples The first comes from San Francisco It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus HIV They went on to get AIDS But there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of HIV They didn't get AIDS And astute clinicians tracked that down and what they found was they were carrying mutations Notice they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective that were protecting them from going on to get AIDS You may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact Second example more recent is elegant work done by Helen Hobbs who said I'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels and I'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels who don't go on to get heart disease And again what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective from birth that kept them even though they had high lipid levels and you can see this is an interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies The project that we're working on is called The Resilience Project: A Search for Unexpected Heroes because what we are interested in doing is saying can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective factors And in some ways think of it as a decoder ring a sort of resilience decoder ring that we're going to try to build We've realized that we should do this in a systematic way so we've said let's take every single childhood inherited disease Let's take them all and let's pull them back a little bit by those that are known to have severe symptoms where the parents the child those around them would know that they'd gotten sick and let's go ahead and then frame them again by those parts of the genes where we know that there is a particular alteration that is known to be highly penetrant to cause that disease Where are we going to look Well we could look locally That makes sense But we began to think maybe we should look all over the world Maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct genetic context there might be environmental factors that protect people And let's look at a million individuals Now the reason why we think it's a good time to do that now is in the last couple of years there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis this type of data generation to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis than it does to do the sample processing and the collection The other reason is that in the last five years there have been awesome tools things about network biology systems biology that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers And as we went around talking to researchers and institutions and telling them about our story something happened They started saying This is interesting I would be glad to join your effort I would be willing to participate And they didn't say Where's the MTA They didn't say Where is my authorship They didn't say Is this data going to be mine Am I going to own it They basically said Let's work on this in an open crowd-sourced team way to do this decoding Six months ago we locked down the screening key for this decoder My co-lead a brilliant scientist Eric Schadt at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and his team locked in that decoder key ring and we began looking for samples because what we realized is maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility Maybe we could take two three percent of the project on and see if it was there And so we started asking people such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia We asked Leif up in Finland and Wang Jun at BGI and again something remarkable happened They said Huh not only do we have samples but often we've analyzed them and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you're looking for And instead of being 20，000 or 30，000 last month we passed one half million samples that we've already analyzed So you must be going Huh did you find any unexpected heroes And the answer is we didn't find one or two We found dozens of these strong candidate unexpected heroes So we think that the time is now to launch the beta phase of this project and actually start getting prospective individuals Basically all we need is information We need a swab of DNA and a willingness to say What's inside me I'm willing to be re-contacted Most of us spend our lives when it comes to health and disease acting as if we're voyeurs We delegate the responsibility for the understanding of our disease for the treatment of our disease to anointed experts In order for us to get this project to work we need individuals to step up in a different role and to be engaged to realize this dream this open crowd-sourced project to find those unexpected heroes to evolve from the current concepts of resources and constraints to design those preventive therapies and to extend it beyond childhood diseases to go all the way up to ways that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's we're going to need us to be looking inside ourselves and asking What are our roles What are our genes and looking within ourselves for information we used to say we should go to the outside to experts and to be willing to share that with others Thank you very much As a little girl I always imagined I would one day run away From the age of six on I kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet There was a deep restlessness in me a primal fear that I would fall prey to a life of routine and boredom And so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders forage for berries and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road Years have passed but many of the adventures I fantasized about as a child -- traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own have become realities through my work as a documentary photographer But no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams as living amongst and documenting the lives This is the nomadic dream a different kind of American dream lived by young hobos travelers hitchhikers vagrants and tramps In most of our minds the vagabond is a creature from the past The word hobo conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal legs dangling out of a boxcar but these photographs are in color and they portray a community swirling across the country fiercely alive and creatively free seeing sides of America that no one else gets to see Like their predecessors today's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the United States By day they hop freight trains stick out their thumbs and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms By night they sleep beneath the stars huddled together with their packs of dogs cats and pet rats between their bodies Some travelers take to the road by choice renouncing materialism traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure Others come from the underbelly of society never given a chance to mobilize upwards: foster care dropouts teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes Where others see stories of privation and economic failure travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom They'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional American dream They take advantage of the fact that in the United States up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans They sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior to dream to read to work on music art and writing But there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic No one loses their inner demons by taking to the road Addiction is real the elements are real freight trains maim and kill and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws that criminalize homeless existence Who here knows that in many cities across the United States it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk to wrap oneself in a blanket to sleep in your own car to offer food to a stranger I know about these laws because I've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so-called crimes Many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this under the thumb of discriminatory laws eating out of trash cans sleeping under bridges picking up seasonal jobs here and there The answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road but travelers often respond with a single word: freedom Until we live in a society where every human is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well not only work to survive there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape of liberation and of course of rebellion Thank you So it was the fall of 1902 and President Theodore Roosevelt needed a little break from the White House so he took a train to Mississippi to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town called Smedes The first day of the hunt they didn't see a single bear so it was a big bummer for everyone but the second day the dogs cornered one after a really long chase but by that point the president had given up and gone back to camp for lunch so his hunting guide cracked the animal on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle and then tied it up to a tree and started tooting away on his bugle to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor of shooting it The bear was a female It was dazed injured severely underweight a little mangy-looking and when Roosevelt saw this animal tied up to the tree he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it He felt like that would go against his code as a sportsman A few days later the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in Washington It was called Drawing a Line in Mississippi and it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out sparing the bear's life and the bear was sitting on its hind legs with these two big frightened wide eyes and little ears pricked up at the top of its head It looked really helpless like you just wanted to sweep it up into your arms and reassure it It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time but if you go looking for the cartoon now you recognize the animal right away: It's a teddy bear And this is how the teddy bear was born Essentially toymakers took the bear from the cartoon turned it into a plush toy and then named it after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear And I do feel a little ridiculous that I'm up here on this stage and I'm choosing to use my time to tell you about a 100-year-old story about the invention of a squishy kid's toy but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear inside that story is a more important story a story about how dramatically our ideas about nature can change and also about how on the planet right now the stories that we tell are dramatically changing nature Because think about the teddy bear For us in retrospect it feels like an obvious fit because bears are so cute and cuddly and who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with but the truth is that in 1902 bears weren't cute and cuddly I mean they looked the same but no one thought of them that way In 1902 bears were monsters Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids For generations at that point the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger that people were encountering on the frontier and the federal government was actually systematically exterminating bears and lots of other predators too like coyotes and wolves These animals they were being demonized They were called murderers because they killed people's livestock One government biologist he explained this war on animals like the bear by saying that they no longer had a place in our advancing civilization and so we were just clearing them out of the way In one 10-year period close to half a million wolves had been slaughtered The grizzly would soon be wiped out from 95 percent of its original territory and whereas once there had been 30 million bison moving across the plains and you would have these stories of trains having to stop for four or five hours so that these thick living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks now by 1902 there were maybe less than 100 left in the wild And so what I'm saying is the teddy bear was born into the middle of this great spasm of extermination and you can see it as a sign that maybe some people deep down were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing America still hated the bear and feared it but all of a sudden America also wanted to give the bear a great big hug So this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years How do we imagine animals how do we think and feel about them and how do their reputations get written and then rewritten in our minds We're here living in the eye of a great storm of extinction where half the species on the planet could be gone by the end of the century and so why is it that we come to care about some of those species and not others Well there's a new field a relatively new field of social science that started looking at these questions and trying to unpack the powerful and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships that we have to animals and I spent a lot of time looking through their academic journals and all I can really say is that their findings are astonishingly wide-ranging So some of my favorites include that the more television a person watches in Upstate New York the more he or she is afraid of being attacked by a black bear If you show a tiger to an American they're much more likely to assume that it's female and not male In a study where a fake snake and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road drivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle and about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals seemed to do it on purpose Women are more likely than men to get a magical feeling when they see dolphins in the surf in a commercial for Purina Americans consider lobsters more important than pigeons but also much much stupider Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs So some of this is physical right We tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us and especially that resemble human babies so with big forward-facing eyes and circular faces kind of a roly-poly posture This is why if you get a Christmas card from like your great aunt in Minnesota there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider But it's not all physical right There's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals and we're telling stories about these animals and like all stories they are shaped by the times and the places in which we're telling them So think about that moment back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear became a teddy bear What was the context Well America was urbanizing For the first time nearly a majority of people lived in cities so there was a growing distance between us and nature There was a safe space where we could reconsider the bear and romanticize it Nature could only start to seem this pure and adorable because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore And you can see that cycle playing out again and again with all kinds of animals It seems like we're always stuck between demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out and then when we get very close to doing that empathizing with it as an underdog and wanting to show it compassion So we exert our power but then we're unsettled by how powerful we are So for example this is one of probably thousands of letters and drawings that kids sent to the Bush administration begging it to protect the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act and these were sent back in the mid-2000s when awareness of climate change was suddenly surging We kept seeing that image of a polar bear stranded on a little ice floe looking really morose I spent days looking through these files I really love them This one's my favorite If you can see it's a polar bear that's drowning and then it's also being eaten simultaneously by a lobster and a shark This one came from a kid named Fritz and he's actually got a solution to climate change He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution He says I feel bad about the polar bears I like polar bears Everyone can use corn juice for cars From Fritz So 200 years ago you would have Arctic explorers writing about polar bears leaping into their boats and trying to devour them even if they lit the bear on fire but these kids don't see the polar bear that way and actually they don't even see the polar bear the way that I did back in the '80s I mean we thought of these animals as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic But look now how quickly that climate change has flipped the image of the animal in our minds It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer to this delicate drowning victim and when you think about it that's kind of the conclusion to the story that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902 because back then America had more or less conquered its share of the continent We were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators Now society's reach has expanded all the way to the top of the world and it's made even these the most remote the most powerful bears on the planet seem like adorable and blameless victims But you know there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story that not a lot of people talk about We're going to talk about it because even though it didn't really take long after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902 for the toy to become a full-blown craze most people figured it was a fad it was a sort of silly political novelty item and it would go away once the president left office and so by 1909 when Roosevelt's successor William Howard Taft was getting ready to be inaugurated the toy industry was on the hunt for the next big thing They didn't do too well That January Taft was the guest of honor at a banquet in Atlanta and for days in advance the big news was the menu They were going to be serving him a Southern specialty a delicacy really called possum and taters So you would have a whole opossum roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes and then sometimes they'd leave the big tail on it like a big meaty noodle The one brought to Taft's table weighed 18 pounds So after dinner the orchestra started to play and the guests burst into song and all of a sudden Taft was surprised with the presentation of a gift from a group of local supporters and this was a stuffed opossum toy all beady-eyed and bald-eared and it was a new product they were putting forward to be the William Taft presidency's answer to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear They were calling it the billy possum Within 24 hours the Georgia Billy Possum Company was up and running brokering deals for these things nationwide and the Los Angeles Times announced very confidently The teddy bear has been relegated to a seat in the rear and for four years possibly eight the children of the United States will play with billy possum So from that point there was a fit of opossum fever There were billy possum postcards billy possum pins billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time There were smaller billy possums on a stick that kids could wave around like flags But even with all this marketing the life of the billy possum turned out to be just pathetically brief The toy was an absolute flop and it was almost completely forgotten by the end of the year and what that means is that the billy possum didn't even make it to Christmastime which when you think about it is a special sort of tragedy for a toy So we can explain that failure two ways The first well it's pretty obvious I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway: Opossums are hideous But maybe more importantly is that the story of the billy possum was all wrong especially compared to the backstory of the teddy bear Think about it: for most of human's evolutionary history what's made bears impressive to us has been their complete independence from us It's that they live these parallel lives as menaces and competitors By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi that stature was being crushed and the animal that he had roped to a tree really was a symbol for all bears Whether those animals lived or died now was entirely up to the compassion or the indifference of people That said something really ominous about the future of bears but it also said something very unsettling about who we'd become if the survival of even an animal like that was up to us now So now a century later if you're at all paying attention to what's happening in the environment you feel that discomfort so much more intensely We're living now in an age of what scientists have started to call conservation reliance and what that term means is that we've disrupted so much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore and most endangered species are only going to survive if we stay out there in the landscape riggging the world around them in their favor So we've gone hands-on and we can't ever take our hands off and that's a hell of a lot of work Right now we're training condors not to perch on power lines We teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter behind little ultra-light airplanes We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones So we've gone from annihilating species to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species indefinitely and which ones Well the ones that we've told compelling stories about the ones we've decided ought to stick around The line between conservation and domestication is blurred So what I've been saying is that the stories that we tell about wild animals are so subjective they can be irrational or romanticized or sensationalized Sometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts But in a world of conservation reliance those stories have very real consequences because now how we feel about an animal affects its survival more than anything that you read about in ecology textbooks Storytelling matters now Emotion matters Our imagination has become an ecological force And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part because the legend of Roosevelt and that bear in Mississippi was kind of like an allegory of this great responsibility that society was just beginning to face up to back then It would be another 71 years before the Endangered Species Act was passed but really here's its whole ethos boiled down into something like a scene you'd see in a stained glass window The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree and the president of the United States decided to show it some mercy Thank you Illustrations by Wendy MacNaughton I'm going to ask and try to answer in some ways kind of an uncomfortable question Both civilians obviously and soldiers suffer in war; I don't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to I've been covering wars for almost 20 years and one of the remarkable things for me is how many soldiers find themselves missing it How is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable and come home back to their home and their family their country and miss the war How does that work What does it mean We have to answer that question because if we don't it'll be impossible to bring soldiers back to a place in society where they belong and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war if we don't understand how that mechanism works The problem is that war does not have a simple neat truth one simple neat truth Any sane person hates war hates the idea of war wouldn't want to have anything to do with it doesn't want to be near it doesn't want to know about it That's a sane response to war But if I asked all of you in this room who here has paid money to go to a cinema and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie most of you would probably raise your hands That's what's so complicated about war And trust me if a room full of peace-loving people finds something compelling about war so do 20-year-old soldiers who have been trained in it I promise you That's the thing that has to be understood I've covered war for about 20 years as I said but my most intense experiences in combat were with American soldiers in Afghanistan I've been in Africa the Middle East Afghanistan in the '90s but it was with American soldiers in 2007 2008 that I was confronted with very intense combat I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley in eastern Afghanistan It was six miles long There were 150 men of Battle Company in that valley and for a while while I was there almost 20 percent of all the combat in all of Afghanistan was happening in those six miles A hundred and fifty men were absorbing almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces in the country for a couple months It was very intense I spent most of my time at a small outpost called Restrepo It was named after the platoon medic that had been killed about two months into the deployment It was a few plywood B-huts clinging to a side of a ridge and sandbags bunkers gun positions and there were 20 men up there of Second Platoon Battle Company I spent most of my time up there There was no running water There was no way to bathe The guys were up there for a month at a time They never even got out of their clothes They fought The worked They slept in the same clothes They never took them off and at the end of the month they went back down to the company headquarters and by then their clothes were unwearable They burned them and got a new set There was no Internet There was no phone There was no communication with the outside world up there There was no cooked food There was nothing up there that young men typically like: no cars no girls no television nothing except combat Combat they did learn to like I remember one day it was a very hot day in the spring and we hadn't been in a fight in a couple of weeks maybe Usually the outpost was attacked and we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks and everyone was just stunned with boredom and heat And I remember the lieutenant walking past me sort of stripped to the waist It was incredibly hot Stripped to the waist walked past me muttering Oh God please someone attack us today That's how bored they were That's war too is a lieutenant saying Please make something happen because we're going crazy To understand that you have to for a moment think about combat not morally -- that's an important job to do but for a moment don't think about it morally think about it neurologically Let's think about what happens in your brain when you're in combat First of all the experience is very bizarre it's a very bizarre one It's not what I had expected Usually you're not scared I've been very scared in combat but most of the time when I was out there I wasn't scared I was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards and that fear that comes afterwards can last years I haven't been shot at in six years and I was woken up very abruptly this morning by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft six years later I've never even been strafed by aircraft and I was having nightmares about it Time slows down You get this weird tunnel vision You notice some details very very very accurately and other things drop out It's almost a slightly altered state of mind What's happening in your brain is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system Young men will go to great lengths to have that experience It's wired into us It's hormonally supported The mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents just the stupid stuff that young men do: jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire I mean you know what I'm talking about They die at six times the rate that young women do Statistically you are safer as a teenage boy you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most American cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for something to do statistically You can imagine how that plays out in combat At Restrepo every guy up there was almost killed including me including my good friend Tim Hetherington who was later killed in Libya There were guys walking around with bullet holes in their uniforms rounds that had cut through the fabric and didn't touch their bodies I was leaning against some sandbags one morning not much going on sort of spacing out and some sand was kicked into the side of sort of hit the side of my face Something hit the side of my face and I didn't know what it was You have to understand about bullets that they go a lot faster than sound so if someone shoots at you from a few hundred meters the bullet goes by you or hits you obviously half a second or so before the sound catches up to it So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face Half a second later I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh It was machine gun fire It was the first round the first burst of an hour-long firefight What had happened was the bullet hit a bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head Imagine just think about it because I certainly did think about the angle of deviation that saved my life At 400 meters it missed me by three inches Just think about the math on that Every guy up there had some experience like that at least once if not many times The boys are up there for a year They got back Some of them got out of the Army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home Some of them stayed in the Army and were more or less okay psychologically I was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne I'm still very good friends with him He came back to the States He got out of the Army I had a dinner party one night I invited him and he started talking with a woman one of my friends and she knew how bad it had been out there and she said Brendan is there anything at all that you miss about being out in Afghanistan about the war And he thought about it quite a long time and finally he said Ma'am I miss almost all of it And he's one of the most traumatized people I've seen from that war Ma'am I miss almost all of it What is he talking about He's not a psychopath He doesn't miss killing people He's not crazy He doesn't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed What is it that he misses We have to answer that If we're going to stop war we have to answer that question I think what he missed is brotherhood He missed in some ways the opposite of killing What he missed was connection to the other men he was with Now brotherhood is different from friendship Friendship happens in society obviously The more you like someone the more you'd be willing to do for them Brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person It's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own In effect you're saying I love these other people more than I love myself Brendan was a team leader in command of three men and the worst day in Afghanistan He was almost killed so many times It didn't bother him The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet knocked him over They thought he was dead It was in the middle of a huge firefight No one could deal with it and a minute later Kyle Steiner sat back up from the dead as it were because he'd come back to consciousness The bullet had just knocked him out It glanced off the helmet He remembers people saying as he was sort of half-conscious he remembers people saying Steiner's been hit in the head Steiner's dead And he was thinking I'm not dead And he sat up And Brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan was realizing that That's brotherhood This wasn't invented recently Many of you have probably read The Iliad Achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend Patroclus In World War II there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded were brought to a rear base hospital who went AWOL crawled out of windows slipped out doors went AWOL wounded to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there So you think about Brendan you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that a bond like that in a small group where they loved 20 other people in some ways more than they loved themselves you think about how good that would feel imagine it and they are blessed with that experience for a year and then they come home and they are just back in society like the rest of us are not knowing who they can count on not knowing who loves them who they can love not knowing exactly what anyone they know would do for them if it came down to it That is terrifying Compared to that war psychologically in some ways is easy compared to that kind of alienation That's why they miss it and that's what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society Thank you very much I'm excited to be here to speak about vets because I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war I didn't join the Army because I had a lust or a need to go overseas and fight Frankly I joined the Army because college is really damn expensive and they were going to help with that and I joined the Army because it was what I knew and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well I didn't come from a military family I'm not a military brat No one in my family ever had joined the military at all and how I first got introduced to the military was when I was 13 years old and I got sent away to military school because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since I was eight years old I had some issues when I was coming up and my mother would always tell me she's like You know if you don't get this together I'm going to send you to military school And I'd look at her and I'd say Mommy I'll work harder And then when I was nine years old she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn't playing around so I'd look at the brochures and I'm like Okay Mommy I can see you're serious and I'll work harder And then when I was 10 and 11 my behavior just kept on getting worse I was on academic and disciplinary probation before I hit double digits and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists when I was 11 years old And so when I was 13 years old my mother came up to me and she was like I'm not going to do this anymore I'm going to send you to military school And I looked at her and I said Mommy I can see you're upset and I'm going to work harder And she was like No you're going next week And that was how I first got introduced to this whole idea of the military because she thought this was a good idea I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when I first showed up there because literally in the first four days I had already run away five times from this school They had these big black gates that surrounded the school and every time they would turn their backs I would just simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don't want to be there we can leave at any time So I just said Well if that's the case then I'd like to leave And it never worked And I kept on getting lost But then eventually after staying there for a little while and after the end of that first year at this military school I realized that I actually was growing up I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure was something that I'd never found before: the fact that I finally felt like I was part of something bigger part of a team and it actually mattered to people that I was there the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there but that it was a real actually core part of the entire experience And so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school I started thinking about what I wanted to do and just like probably most students had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do And I thought about the people who I respected and admired I thought about a lot of the people in particular a lot of the men in my life who I looked up to They all happened to wear the uniform of the United States of America so for me the question and the answer really became pretty easy The question of what I wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying I guess I'll be an Army officer So the Army then went through this process and they trained me up and when I say I didn't join the Army because I wanted to go to war the truth is I joined in 1996 There really wasn't a whole lot going on I didn't ever feel like I was in danger When I went to my mom I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old so I literally needed parental permission to join the Army so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom and she just assumed it was kind of like military school She was like Well it was good for him before so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing was actually signing her son up to become an Army officer And I went through the process and again the whole time still just thinking this is great maybe I'll serve on a weekend or two weeks during the year do drill and then a couple years after I signed up a couple years after my mother signed those papers the whole world changed And after 9/11 there was an entirely new context about the occupation that I chose When I first joined I never joined to fight but now that I was in this is exactly what was now going to happen And I thought about so much about the soldiers who I eventually had to end up leading I remember when we first right after 9/11 three weeks after 9/11 I was on a plane heading overseas but I wasn't heading overseas with the military I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship to go overseas I received the scholarship to go overseas and to go study and live overseas and I was living in England and that was interesting but at the same time the same people who I was training with the same soldiers that I went through all my training with and we prepared for war they were now actually heading over to it They were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people the vast majority of us as we were training couldn't even point out on a map I spent a couple years finishing graduate school and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there in buildings at Oxford that were literally built hundreds of years before the United States was even founded and I'm sitting there talking to dons about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and how that influenced the start of World War I where the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers who were now throwing on Kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do I change around or how exactly do I clean a machine gun in the darkness That was the new reality By the time I finished that up and I rejoined my military unit and we were getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before I even had my first I remember walking out with my unit for the first time and when you join the Army and you go through a combat tour everyone looks at your shoulder because on your shoulder is your combat patch And so immediately as you meet people you shake their hand and then your eyes go to their shoulder because you want to see where did they serve or what unit did they serve with And I was the only person walking around with a bare shoulder and it burned every time someone stared at it But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers and you ask them why did they sign up I signed up because college was expensive A lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons They signed up because of a sense of obligation They signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it They signed up because their family said this was important They signed up because they wanted some form of revenge They signed for a whole collection of different reasons And now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts And what was amazing to me was that I very naively started hearing this statement that I never fully understood because right after 9/11 you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say Well thank you for your service And I just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers This is even before I deployed But I really had no idea what that even meant I just said it because it sounded right I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served overseas Thank you for your service But I had no idea what the context was or what that even what it even meant to the people who heard it When I first came back from Afghanistan I thought that if you make it back from conflict then the dangers were all over I thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say Whew I'm glad I dodged that one without understanding that for so many people as they come back home the war keeps going It keeps playing out in all of our minds It plays out in all of our memories It plays out in all of our emotions Please forgive us if we don't like being in big crowds Please forgive us when we spend one week in a place that has 100 percent light discipline because you're not allowed to walk around with white lights because if anything has a white light it can be seen from miles away versus if you use little green or little blue lights they cannot be seen from far away So please forgive us if out of nowhere we go from having 100 percent light discipline to then a week later being back in the middle of Times Square and we have a difficult time adjusting to that Please forgive us when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you and now when you come back it's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normality because the whole normal has changed I remember when I came back I wanted to talk to people I wanted people to ask me about my experiences I wanted people to come up to me and tell me What did you do I wanted people to come up to me and tell me What was it like What was the food like What was the experience like How are you doing And the only questions I got from people was Did you shoot anybody And those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything Because sometimes there's this fear and there's this apprehension that if I say anything I'm afraid I'll offend or I'm afraid I'll trigger something so the common default is just saying nothing The problem with that is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged like no one even cared Thank you for your service and we move on What I wanted to better understand was what's behind that and why thank you for your service isn't enough The fact is we have literally 2。6 million men and women who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan who are all amongst us Sometimes we know who they are sometimes we don't but there is that feeling the shared experience the shared bond where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life while it might be closed it's still not over We think about thank you for your service and people say So what does 'thank you for your service' mean to you Well Thank you for your service means to me it means acknowledging our stories asking us who we are understanding the strength that so many people so many people who we serve with have and why that service means so much Thank you for your service means acknowledging the fact that just because we've now come home and we've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over The fact is there's still a tremendous amount that can be offered and can be given When I look at people like our friend Taylor Urruela who in Iraq loses his leg had two big dreams in his life One was to be a soldier The other was to be a baseball player He loses his leg in Iraq He comes back and instead of deciding that well now since I've lost my leg that second dream is over he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball and he starts this group called VETSports which now works with veterans all over the country and uses sports as a way of healing People like Tammy Duckworth who was a helicopter pilot and with the helicopter that she was flying you need to use both your hands and also your legs to steer and her helicopter gets hit and she's trying to steer the chopper but the chopper's not reacting to her instructions and to her commands She's trying to land the chopper safely but the chopper doesn't land safely and the reason it's not landing safely is because it's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off She barely survives Medics come and they save her life but then as she's doing her recuperation back at home she realizes that My job's still not done And now she uses her voice as a Congresswoman from Illinois to fight and advocate for a collection of issues to include veterans issues We signed up because we love this country we represent We signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right And the only thing we then ask is that thank you for your service needs to be more than just a quote break that thank you for your service means honestly digging in to the people who have stepped up simply because they were asked to and what that means for us not just now not just during combat operations but long after the last vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken These are the people who I served with and these are the people who I honor So thank you for your service As a student of adversity I've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them and I've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning And for a long time I thought the meaning was out there some great truth waiting to be found But over time I've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant We call it finding meaning but we might better call it forging meaning My last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring and one of the mothers I interviewed who had two children with multiple severe disabilities said to me People always give us these little sayings like 'God doesn't give you any more than you can handle，' but children like ours are not preordained as a gift They're a gift because that's what we have chosen We make those choices all our lives When I was in second grade Bobby Finkel had a birthday party and invited everyone in our class but me My mother assumed there had been some sort of error and she called Mrs Finkel who said that Bobby didn't like me and didn't want me at his party And that day my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae nicknamed me Percy as a shorthand for my demeanor and sometimes he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride 45 minutes up 45 minutes back Percy Percy Percy Percy When I was in eighth grade that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter And I graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where I would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance What I didn't know then and do know now is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning After you've forged meaning you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity You need to take the traumas and make them part of who you've come to be and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph evincing a better self in response to things that hurt One of the other mothers I interviewed when I was working on my book had been raped as an adolescent and had a child following that rape which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships But when I met her she was 50 and I said to her Do you often think about the man who raped you And she said I used to think about him with anger but now only with pity And I thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing And I said Pity And she said Yes because he has a beautiful daughter and two beautiful grandchildren and he doesn't know that and I do So as it turns out I'm the lucky one Some of our struggles are things we're born to: our gender our sexuality our race our disability And some are things that happen to us: being a political prisoner being a rape victim being a Katrina survivor Identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community and to give strength there too It involves substituting and for but -- not I am here but I have cancer but rather I have cancer and I am here When we're ashamed we can't tell our stories and stories are the foundation of identity Forge meaning build identity forge meaning and build identity That became my mantra Forging meaning is about changing yourself Building identity is about changing the world All of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily: how much to accommodate society by constraining ourselves and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life Forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right It only makes what was wrong precious In January of this year I went to Myanmar to interview political prisoners and I was surprised to find them less bitter than I'd anticipated Most of them had knowingly committed the offenses that landed them in prison and they had walked in with their heads held high and they walked out with their heads still held high many years later Dr Ma Thida a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think for the wisdom she had gained for the chance to hone her meditation skills She had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity But if the people I met were less bitter than I'd anticipated about being in prison they were also less thrilled than I'd expected about the reform process going on in their country Ma Thida said We Burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure but we also have grievance under glamour she said and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn't erase the continuing problems in our society that we learned to see so well while we were in prison And I understood her to be saying that concessions confer only a little humanity where full humanity is due that crumbs are not the same as a place at the table which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell I've never been raped and I've never been in anything remotely approaching a Burmese prison but as a gay American I've experienced prejudice and even hatred and I've forged meaning and I've built identity which is a move I learned from people who had experienced far worse privation than I've ever known In my own adolescence I went to extreme lengths to try to be straight I enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy in which people I was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what I was encouraged to call exercises with women I was encouraged to call surrogates who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else My particular favorite was a blonde woman from the Deep South who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue These experiences eventually allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women for which I'm grateful but I was at war with myself and I dug terrible wounds into my own psyche We don't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences We cannot bear a pointless torment but we can endure great pain if we believe that it's purposeful Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle We could have been ourselves without our delights but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities St Paul wrote in Second Corinthians for when I am weak then I am strong In 1988 I went to Moscow to interview artists of the Soviet underground and I expected their work to be dissident and political But the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself as in some senses Russian society is now doing again One of the artists I met said to me We were in training to be not artists but angels In 1991 I went back to see the artists I'd been writing about and I was with them during the putsch that ended the Soviet Union and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch And on the third day of the putsch one of them suggested we walk up to Smolenskaya And we went there and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades and a little while later a column of tanks rolled up and the soldier on the front tank said We have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade If you get out of the way we don't need to hurt you but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down And the artists I was with said Give us just a minute Give us just a minute to tell you why we're here And the soldier folded his arms and the artist launched into a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who live in a Jeffersonian democracy would be hard-pressed to present And they went on and on and the soldier watched and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain and said What you have said is true and we must bow to the will of the people If you'll clear enough space for us to turn around we'll go back the way we came And that's what they did Sometimes forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it and I gradually understood that as the cornerstone of identity It took identity to rescue me from sadness The gay rights movement posits a world in which my aberrances are a victory Identity politics always works on two fronts: to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly Those are two totally separate enterprises but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other Identity politics can be narcissistic People extol a difference only because it's theirs People narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another But properly understood and wisely practiced identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal but a revolution I would have had an easier life if I were straight but I would not be me and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else someone who to be honest I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine But if you banish the dragons you banish the heroes and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta of which this speech is one manifestation I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis but the self-loathing of that period left a void and celebration needs to fill and overflow it and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address Someday being gay will be a simple fact free of party hats and blame but not yet A friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we organize Gay Humility Week It's a great idea but its time has not yet come And neutrality which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration is actually the endgame In 29 states in the U。S。 I could legally be fired or denied housing for being gay In Russia the anti-propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets Twenty-seven African countries have passed laws against sodomy and in Nigeria gay people can legally be stoned to death and lynchings have become common In Saudi Arabia recently two men who had been caught in carnal acts were sentenced to 7，000 lashes each and are now permanently disabled as a result So who can forge meaning and build identity Gay rights are not primarily marriage rights and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources dignity remains elusive I am lucky to have forged meaning and built identity but that's still a rare privilege and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice And yet every step forward is so sweet In 2007 six years after we met my partner and I decided to get married Meeting John had been the discovery of great happiness and also the elimination of great unhappiness and sometimes I was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain that I forgot about the joy which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me Marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence than an absence Marriage soon led us to children and that meant new meanings and new identities ours and theirs I want my children to be happy and I love them most achingly when they are sad As a gay father I can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives but I believe that if I succeed in sheltering them from adversity I will have failed as a parent A Buddhist scholar I know once explained to me that Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you and you have only bliss to look forward to But he said that would not be nirvana because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past Nirvana he said is what you arrive at when you have only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy And I sometimes wonder whether I could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they'd come more readily if I'd been straight in my youth or were young now in either of which cases this might be easier Perhaps I could Perhaps all the complex imagining I've done could have been applied to other topics But if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning the question is not whether I'd be happier for having been bullied but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father I tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys because I did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me I know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh and gay families so exhilaratingly new and I found meaning in that surprise In October it was my 50th birthday and my family organized a party for me and in the middle of it my son said to my husband that he wanted to make a speech and John said George you can't make a speech You're four Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I are going to make speeches tonight But George insisted and insisted and finally John took him up to the microphone and George said very loudly Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please And everyone turned around startled And George said I'm glad it's Daddy's birthday I'm glad we all get cake And daddy if you were little I'd be your friend And I thought Thank you I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment and I was finally unconditionally grateful for a life I'd once have done anything to change The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement and Harvey Milk said Go out and tell someone There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity and there are always stories that restore it If we live out loud we can trounce the hatred and expand everyone's lives Forge meaning Build identity Forge meaning Build identity And then invite the world to share your joy Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online started out the way most things do: without me and not online On December 10 1896 the man on the medal Alfred Nobel died One hundred years later exactly actually December 10 1996 this charming lady Wislawa Szymborska won the Nobel Prize for literature She's a Polish poet She's a big deal obviously but back in '96 I thought I had never heard of her and when I checked out her work I found this sweet little poem Four in the Morning The hour from night to day The hour from side to side The hour for those past thirty。。 And it goes on but as soon as I read this poem I fell for it hard so hard I suspected we must have met somewhere before Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem Did I flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere I could not place it and it bugged me and then in the coming week or two I would just be watching an old movie and this would happen Groucho Marx: Charlie you should have come to the first party We didn't get home till around four in the morning Rives: My roommates would have the TV on and this would happen George Costanza: Oh boy I was up til four in the morning watching that Omen trilogy Rives: I would be listening to music and this would happen Elton John: It's four o'clock in the morning damn it Rives: So you can see what was going on right Obviously the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me Some people get a number stuck in their head you may recognize a certain name or a tune some people get nothing but four in the morning was in me now but mildly like a groin injury I always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually and I never talked about it with anybody but it did not and I totally did In 2007 I was invited to speak at TED for the second time and since I was still an authority on nothing I thought what if I made a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year I found four in the morning in a novel by Isabel Allende I found a really great one in the autobiography of Bill Clinton I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening although Matt Groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and I gather that he is not an early riser However had Matt been there he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble It was totally contrived just for that room just for that moment That's how we did it in the pre-TED。com days It was fun That was pretty much it When I got home though the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live beginning with and this is still my favorite Here's another one for your collection: 'It's the friends you can call up at 4 a。m that matter。' The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich The email itself was from another very sexy European type TED Curator Chris Anderson Chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something and I'm thinking this man is the Typhoid Mary of ideas worth spreading and I have infected him I am contagious which was confirmed less than a week later when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation As a bonus she hooked me up with a second one they make It says Just knowing I can call you at four in the morning if I need to makes me not really need to which I love because together these are like Hallmark: When you care enough to send the very best twice phrased slightly differently I was not surprised at the TEDster and New Yorker magazine overlap A bunch of people sent me this when it came out It's 4 a。m。—maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap I was surprised at the TEDster/Rugrats overlap More than one person sent me this Didi Pickles: It's four o'clock in the morning Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster who was disgruntled I had overlooked what he considers to be a classic Roy Neary: Get up get up I'm not kidding Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident Roy: No it's not an accident You wanted to get out of the house anyway right Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning Rives: So that's Close Encounters and the main character is all worked up because aliens momentously have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning which does make that a very solid example Those were all really solid examples They did not get me any closer to understanding why I thought I recognized this one particular poem But they followed the pattern They played along Right Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur Maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before Maybe I was on the trail of a new meme or something Just when things were getting pretty interesting things got really interesting TED。com launched later that year with a bunch of videos from past talks including mine and I started receiving four in the morning citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet Much of it was content I never would have found on my own if I was looking for it and I was not I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes I probably would have missed the booklet Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning I do not subscribe to Crochet Today magazine although it looks delightful Take note of those clock ends This is a college student's suggestion for what a four in the morning gang sign should look like People sent me magazine ads They took photographs in grocery stores I got a ton of graphic novels and comics A lot of good quality work too: The Sandman Watchmen There's a very cute example here from Calvin and Hobbes In fact the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the Stone Age Take a look Wilma Flintstone: Like how early Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a。m。 that's how early Rives: And the flip side of the timeline this is from the 31st century A thousand years from now people are still doing this The time is 4 a。m Rives: It shows the spectrum I received so many songs TV shows movies like from dismal to famous I could give you a four-hour playlist If I just stick to modern male movie stars I keep it to the length of about a commercial Here's your sampler Rives: So somewhere along the line I realized I have a hobby I didn't know I wanted and it is crowdsourced But I was also thinking what you might be thinking which is really couldn't you do this with any hour of the day First of all you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon Secondly I did a little research You know I was kind of interested If this is confirmation bias there is so much confirmation I am biased Literature probably shows it best There are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare There's a five in the morning There are seven four in the mornings and they're all very dire In Measure for Measure it's the call time for the executioner Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia at four in the morning right before battle in War and Peace Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning as does Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights Lolita has as a creepy four in the morning Huckleberry Finn has one in dialect Someone sent in H。G Wells' The Invisible Man Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man The Great Gatsby spends the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows and the most famous wake-up in literature perhaps The Metamorphosis First paragraph the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach but we already know cockroach notwithstanding something is up with this guy Why His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning What kind of person would do that This kind of person would do that Newcaster: Top of the hour Time for the morning news But of course there is no news yet Everyone's still asleep in their comfy comfy beds Rives: Exactly Mommie Dearest Rocky first day of training Nelson Mandela first day in office and Bart Simpson which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a dinner party and gives me yet another category people waking up in my big old database Just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect say stuffed polar bears and they send them to you Even if you don't really at a certain point you totally collect stuffed polar bears and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass And when I got to that point I embraced it I got my curator on I started fact checking downloading illegally screen-grabbing I started archiving My hobby had become a habit and my habit gave me possibly the world's most eclectic Netflix queue At one point it went Guys and Dolls: The Musical Last Tango in Paris Diary of a Wimpy Kid Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy Why Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy Because someone told me I would find this clip in there Ron Jeremy: I was born in Flushing Queens on March 12 1953 at four o'clock in the morning Rives: Of course he was Yeah Not only does it seem to make sense it also answers the question What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir have in common Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence I was born at four o'clock in the morning which I had because someone else had emailed it to me and when they did I had another bump up in my entry for this because porn star Ron Jeremy and feminist Simone de Beauvoir are not just different people They are different people that have this thing connecting them and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge or inadvertent expertise but I did wonder is there maybe a cooler way to do this So last October in gentleman scholar tradition I put the entire collection online as Museum of Four in the Morning You can click on that red refresh button It will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection Here is a knockout poem by Billy Collins called Forgetfulness Billy Collins: No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart Rives: So the first hour of this project was satisfying A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe Half a globe away a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me a stranger Less than a week later though I received a little bit of grace I received a poignant tweet It was brief It just said Reminds me of an ancient mix tape The name was a pseudonym actually or a pseudo-pseudonym As soon as I saw the initials and the profile pic I knew immediately my whole body knew immediately who this was and I knew immediately what mix tape she was talking about L。D was my college romance This is in the early '90s I was an undegrad She was a grad student in the library sciences department Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off lets her hair down suddenly she's smoking hot She was already smoking hot she was super dorky and we had a December-May romance meaning we started dating in December and by May she had graduated and became my one that got away But her mix tape did not get away I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards not just from L。D。 from my life but for decades It's the kind of box where if I have a girlfriend I tend to hide it from her and if I had a wife I'm sure I would share it with her but the story with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side but no song titles Instead L。D has used the U。S Library of Congress classification system including page numbers to leave me clues When I got this mix tape I put it in my cassette player I took it to the campus library her library I found 14 books on the shelves I remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table and I read poems paired to songs like food to wine paired I can tell you like saddle shoes to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress I did this again last October I'm sitting there I got new earbuds old Walkman I realize this is just the kind of extravagance I used to take for granted even when I was extravagant And then I thought Good for him PG is Slavic literature 7000 series Polish literature Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem paired with Paul Simon's Peace Like a River Paul Simon: Oh four in the morning I woke up from out of my dream Rives: Thank you Appreciate it Pheromone is a very powerful word It conjures up sex abandon loss of control and you can see it's very important as a word But it's only 50 years old It was invented in 1959 Now if you put that word into the web as you may have done you'll come up with millions of hits and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible for 10 dollars or more Now this is a very attractive idea and the molecules they mention sound really science-y They've got lots of syllables It's things like androstenol androstenone It gets better and better you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this But sadly these are fraudulent claims supported by dodgy science The problem is that although there are many good scientists working on what they think are human pheromones and they're publishing in respectable journals at the basis of this despite very sophisticated experiments there really is no good science behind it because it's based on a problem which is nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce -- and there are thousands of molecules that we give off We're mammals We produce a lot of smell Nobody has gone through systematically to work out which molecules really are pheromones They've just plucked a few and all these experiments are based on those but there's no good evidence at all Now that's not to say that smell is not important to people It is and some people are real enthusiasts and one of these was Napoleon And famously you may remember that out on the campaign trail for war he wrote to his lover Empress Josephine saying Don't wash I'm coming home So he didn't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he'd get home and it is still you'll find websites that offer this as a major quirk At the same time though we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business So what I want to do in the rest of this talk is tell you about what pheromones really are tell you why I think we would expect humans to have pheromones tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones and then finally I want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going So the ancient Greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other A female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around and it wasn't a sound it was a smell You could take the smell from the female dog and the dogs would chase the cloth But the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn't identify the molecules You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical The reason for that of course is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities and in the case of the dog males dogs can smell it but we can't smell it And it was only in 1959 that a German team after spending 20 years in search of these molecules discovered identified the first pheromone and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth Now this was an inspired choice by Adolf Butenandt and his team because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis But he created the model for how you should go about pheromone analysis He basically went through systematically showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males not all the others He analyzed it very carefully He synthesized the molecule and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was indeed that molecule That's closing the circle That's the thing which has never been done with humans: nothing systematic no real demonstration With that new concept we needed a new word and that was the word pheromone and it's basically transferred excitement transferred between individuals and since 1959 pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom in male animals in female animals It works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters And almost every mammal you can think of has had a pheromone identified and of course an enormous number of insects So we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom What about humans Well the first thing of course is that we're mammals and mammals are smelly As any dog owner can tell you we smell they smell But the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we grow up The smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children What's changed And of course it's puberty Along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits new glands start to secrete in those places and that's what's making the change in smell If we were any other kind of mammal or any other kind of animal we would say That must be something to do with pheromones and we'd start looking properly But there are some problems and this is why I think people have not looked for pheromones so effectively in humans There are indeed problems And the first of these is perhaps surprising It's all about culture Now moths don't learn a lot about what is good to smell but humans do and up to the age of about four any smell no matter how rancid is simply interesting And I understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo because it's always something nice to smell But gradually we learn what's not good and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good is what is good Now the cheese behind me is a British if not an English delicacy It's ripe blue Stilton Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries Every culture has its own special food and national delicacy If you were to come from Iceland your national dish Now all of these things are acquired tastes but they form almost a badge of identity You're part of the in-group The second thing is the sense of smell Each of us has a unique odor world in the sense that what we smell we each smell a completely different world Now smell was the hardest of the senses to crack and the Nobel Prize awarded to Richard Axel and Linda Buck for their discovery of how smell works It's really hard but in essence nerves from the brain go up into the nose and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors and if they bond they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain We don't just have one kind of receptor If you're a human you have about 400 different kinds of receptors and the brain knows what you're smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion But it's a bit more complicated because each of those 400 comes in various variants and depending which variant you have you might smell coriander or cilantro that herb either as something delicious and savory or something like soap So we each have an individual world of smell and that complicates anything when we're studying smell Well we really ought to talk about armpits and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones Now I'm not going to share them with you but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones There is one good reason which is the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic The other primates have scent glands in other parts of the body The great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells all the time enormous numbers of molecules When they're secreted from the glands the molecules are odorless They have no smell at all and it's only the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love And so incidentally if you want to reduce the amount of smell clear-cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria and you'll find they remain less smelly for much longer But although we've focused on armpits I think it's partly because they're the least embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples There is actually another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there and that's because 20 percent of the world's population doesn't have smelly armpits like me And these are people from China Japan Korea and other parts of northeast Asia They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits So it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world So what should we be doing in our search for human pheromones I'm fairly convinced that we do have them We're mammals like everybody else who's a mammal and we probably do have them But what I think we should do is go right back to the beginning and basically look all over the body No matter how embarrassing we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread It's going to be difficult it's going to be embarrassing but we need to look We also need to go back to the ideas that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth We need to go back and look systematically at all the molecules that are being produced and work out which ones are really involved It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say They'll do We have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by They're in France and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone They've turned their attention now to human babies and mothers So this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother's breast Her nipple is completely hidden by the baby's head but what you'll notice is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it and that's the secretion from the areolar glands Now we all have them men and women and these are the little bumps around the nipple and if you're a lactating woman these start to secrete It's a very interesting secretion What Benoist Schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be in effect a simple bioassay So this is a sleeping baby and under its nose we've put a clean glass rod The baby remains sleeping showing no interest at all But if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands so it's not about recognition it can be from any mother if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby's nose we get a very different reaction It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck Now since this is from any mother it could really be a pheromone It's not about individual recognition Any mother will do Now why is this important apart from being simply very interesting It's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have and there is a correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle and the number of areolar glands she has It appears that the more secretions she's got the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly If you're a mammal the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth You have to get that first drink of milk and if you don't get it you won't survive You'll be dead Since many babies actually find it difficult to take that first meal because they're not getting the right stimulus if we could identify what that molecule was and the French team are being very cautious but if we could identify the molecule synthesize it it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to suckle and every baby would have a better chance of survival So what I want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones There could be all sorts of medical interventions There could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don't know at the moment What we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex They're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal's life So do go forward and do search for more There's lots to find Thank you very much So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank and it's clear that the general public needs guidance because the average bank robbery nets only 7，500 dollars Rank amateurs who know nothing about how to cook the books The folks who know of course run our largest banks and in the last go-around they cost us over 11 trillion dollars That's what 11 trillion looks like That's how many zeros And cost us over 10 million jobs as well So our task is to educate ourselves so that we can understand why we have these recurrent intensifying financial crises and how we can prevent them in the future And the answer to that is that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud Control fraud is what happens when the people who control typically a CEO a seemingly legitimate entity use it as a weapon to defraud And these are the weapons of mass destruction in the financial world They also follow in finance a particular strategy because the weapon of choice in finance is accounting and there is a recipe for accounting And we discovered this recipe in quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy; second by making or buying really crappy loans but loans that are made at a very high interest rate or yield; three while employing extreme leverage -- that just means a lot of debt -- compared to your equity; and four while providing only trivial loss reserves against the inevitable losses If you follow those four simple steps and any bank can follow them then you are mathematically guaranteed to have three things occur The first thing is you will report record bank profits -- not just high record Two the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy by modern executive compensation And three farther down the road the bank will suffer catastrophic losses and will fail unless it is bailed out And that's a hint as to how we discovered this recipe because we discovered it through an autopsy process During the savings and loan debacle in 1984 we looked at every single failure and we looked for common characteristics and we discovered this recipe was common to each of these frauds In other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe that will destroy the banks as well as the economy And it also turns out to be precisely what could have stopped this crisis the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars just in the household sector that cost us 10 million jobs was the easiest financial crisis by far to have avoided completely if we had simply learned the lessons of epidemics of control fraud particularly using this recipe So let's go to this crisis and the two huge epidemics of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis -- appraisal fraud and liar's loans -- and what we're going to see in looking at both of these is we got warnings that were incredibly early about these frauds We got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily because back in the savings and loan debacle we had figured out how to respond and prevent these crises And three the warnings were unambiguous They were obvious that what was going on was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up Let's take appraisal fraud first This is simply where you inflate the value of the home that is being pledged as security for the loan In 2000 the year 2000 that is over a year before Enron fails by the way the honest appraisers got together a formal petition begging the federal government to act and the industry to act to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud And the appraisers explained how it was occurring that banks were demanding that appraisers inflate the appraisal and that if the appraisers refused to do so they the banks would blacklist honest appraisers and refuse to use them Now we've seen this before in the savings and loan debacle and we know that this kind of fraud can only originate from the lenders and that no honest lender would ever inflate the appraisal because it's the great protection against loss So this was an incredibly early warning 2000 It was something we'd seen before and it was completely unambiguous This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud led by the banks What about liar's loans Well that warning actually comes earlier The savings and loan debacle is basically the early 1980s through 1993 and in the midst of fighting that wave of accounting control fraud in 1990 we found that a second front of fraud was being started And like all good financial frauds in America it began in Orange County California And we happened to be the regional regulators for it And our examiners said they are making loans without even checking what the borrower's income is This is insane it has to lead to massive losses and it only makes sense for entities engaged in these accounting control frauds And we said yeah you're absolutely right and we drove those liar's loans but we could only deal with the industry we had jurisdiction over which was savings and loans and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds Long Beach Savings voluntarily gave up its federal savings and loan charter gave up federal deposit insurance converted to become a mortgage bank for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction and changed its name to Ameriquest and became the most notorious of the liar's loans frauds early on and to add to that they deliberately predated upon minorities So we knew again about this crisis We'd seen it before We'd stopped it before We had incredibly early warnings of it and it was absolutely unambiguous that no honest lender would make loans in this fashion So let's take a look at the reaction of the industry and the regulators and the prosecutors to these clear early warnings that could have prevented the crisis Start with the industry The industry responded between 2003 and 2006 by increasing liar's loans by over 500 percent These were the loans that hyperinflated the bubble and produced the economic crisis By 2006 half of all the loans called subprime were also liar's loans They're not mutually exclusive it's just that together they're the most toxic combination you can possibly imagine made that year all the home loans made that year were liar's loans 40 percent And this is despite a warning from the industry's own antifraud experts that said that these loans were an open invitation to fraudsters and that they had a fraud incidence of 90 percent nine zero In response to that the industry first started calling these loans liar's loans which lacks a certain subtlety and second massively increased them and no government regulator ever required or encouraged any lender to make a liar's loan or anyone to purchase a liar's loan and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie This came from the lenders because of the fraud recipe What happened to appraisal fraud It expanded remarkably as well By 2007 when a survey of appraisers was done that they had been subject to coercion from the lenders trying to get them to inflate an appraisal In other words both forms of fraud became absolutely endemic and normal and this is what drove the bubble What happened in the governmental sector Well the government as I told you when we were the savings and loan regulators we could only deal with our industry and if people gave up their federal deposit insurance we couldn't do anything to them Congress it may strike you as impossible but actually did something intelligent in 1994 and passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act that gave the Fed and only the Federal Reserve the explicit statutory authority to ban liar's loans by every lender whether or not they had federal deposit insurance So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan as chairs of the Fed do when they got these warnings that these were massively fraudulent loans and that they were being sold to the secondary market Remember there's no fraud exorcist Once it starts out a fraudulent loan it can only be sold to the secondary market through more frauds lying about the reps and warrantees and then those people are going to produce mortgage-backed securities and exotic derivatives which are also going to be supposedly backed by those fraudulent loans So the fraud is going to progress through the entire system hyperinflate the bubble produce a disaster And remember we had experience with this We had seen significant losses and we had experience of competent regulators in stopping it Greenspan and Bernanke refused to use the authority under the statute to stop liar's loans And this was a matter first of dogma They're just horrifically opposed to anything regulatory But it is also the international competition in laxity the race to the bottom between the United States and the United Kingdom the city of London in particular but it meant that all regulation in the West was completely degraded in this stupid competition to be who could have the weakest regulation So that was the regulatory response What about the response of the prosecutors after the crisis after 11 trillion dollars in losses after 10 million jobs lost a crisis in which the losses and the frauds were more than 70 times larger than the savings and loan debacle Well in the savings and loan debacle our agency that regulated savings and loans OTS made over 30，000 criminal referrals produced over 1，000 felony convictions just in cases designated as major and that understates the degree of prioritization because we worked with the FBI to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes the absolute worst of the worst nationwide Roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior officials Virtually all of them were prosecuted We had a 90 percent conviction rate It's the greatest success against elite white collar criminals ever and it was because of this understanding of control fraud and the accounting control fraud mechanism Flash forward to the current crisis The same agency Office of Thrift Supervision which was supposed to regulate many of the largest makers of liar's loans has made even today -- it no longer exists but as of a year ago it had made zero criminal referrals The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks has made zero criminal referrals The Fed appears to have made zero criminal referrals The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is smart enough to refuse to answer the question Without any guidance from the regulators there's no expertise in the FBI to investigate complex frauds It isn't simply that they've had to reinvent the wheel of how to do these prosecutions; they've forgotten that the wheel exists and therefore we have zero prosecutions and of course zero convictions of any of the elite bank frauds the Wall Street types that drove this crisis With no expertise coming from the regulators the FBI formed what it calls a partnership with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007 The Mortgage Bankers Association is the trade association of the perps And the Mortgage Bankers Association set out it had the audacity and the success to con the FBI It had created a supposed definition of mortgage fraud in which guess what its members are always the victim and never the perpetrators And the FBI has bought this hook line sinker rod reel and the boat they rode out in And so the FBI under the leadership of an attorney general who is African-American and a president of the United States who is African-American have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis in which it is the first virgin crisis in history conceived without sin in the executive ranks And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers who were able to defraud the poor pitiful banks who lack any financial sophistication It is the silliest story you can conceive of and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers and they leave the banksters alone entirely And so while lions are roaming the campsite the FBI is chasing mice What do we need to do What can we do in all of this We need to change the perverse incentive structures that produce these recurrent epidemics of accounting control fraud that are driving our crises So we have to first get rid of the systemically dangerous institutions These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions We need to shrink them to the point within the next five years that they no longer pose a systemic risk Right now they are ticking time bombs that will cause a global crisis as soon as the next one fails -- not if when Second thing we need to do is completely reform modern executive and professional compensation which is what they use to suborn the appraisers Remember they were pressuring the appraisers through the compensation system trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic in which bad ethics drives good ethics out of the marketplace And they largely succeeded which is how the fraud became endemic And the third thing that we need to do is deal with what we call the three D's: deregulation desupervision and the de facto decriminalization Because we can make all three of these changes and if we do so we can dramatically reduce how often we have a crisis and how severe those crises are That is not simply critical to our economy You can see what these crises do to inequality and what they do to our democracy They have produced crony capitalism American-style in which the largest financial institutions are the leading financial donors of both parties and that's the reason why even after this crisis 70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis we have no meaningful reforms in any of the three areas that I've talked about other than banning liar's loans which is good but that's just one form of ammunition for this fraud weapon There are many forms of ammunition they can use That's why we need to learn what the bankers have learned: the recipe for the best way to rob a bank so that we can stop that recipe because our legislators who are dependent on political contributions will not do it on their own Thank you very much I'm assuming everyone here has watched a TED Talk online at one time or another right So what I'm going to do is play this This is the song from the TED Talks online And I'm going to slow it down because things sound cooler when they're slower Ken Robinson: Good morning How are you Mark Applebaum: I'm going to -- Kate Stone: -- mix some music I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before I have a crossfader Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer Two D。J decks You turn up the dials the wheel starts to turn Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything that's going on inside my body Adam Ockelford: In your brain is this amazing musical computer MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create works It's a language that's still evolving And the 21st century KR: Turn on the radio Pop into the discotheque You will know what this person is doing: moving to the music Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part You gotta have doorstops That's important TM: We all love music a great deal MTT: Anthems dance crazes ballads and marches Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It is new music created from old music Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes MTT: What happens when the music stops Yay MR: Obviously I've been watching a lot of TED Talks When I was first asked to speak at TED I wasn't quite sure what my angle was at first so yeah I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks which is pretty much absolutely the worst thing that you can do because you start to go into panic mode thinking I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet Neither have I provided electricity to my village through sheer ingenuity In fact I've pretty much wasted most of my life DJing in night clubs and producing pop records But I still kept watching the videos because I'm a masochist and eventually things like Michael Tilson Thomas and Tod Machover and seeing their visceral passion talking about music it definitely stirred something in me and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly about the power of music And I started to write down on these little note cards every time I heard something that struck a chord in me pardon the pun or something that I thought I could use and pretty soon my studio looked like this kind of like a John Nash Beautiful Mind vibe The other good thing about watching TED Talks when you see a really good one you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend don't you Like just for a day They seem like a nice person You'd take a bike ride maybe share an ice cream You'd certainly learn a lot And every now and then they'd chide you when they got frustrated that you couldn't really keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary mortal intelligence that didn't finish university and they'd kind of forgive you and pet you like the dog Man yeah back to the real world probably Sir Ken Robinson and I are not going to end up being best of friends He lives all the way in L。A and I imagine is quite busy but through the tools available to me -- technology and the innate way that I approach making music -- I can sort of bully our existences into a shared event which is sort of what you saw I can hear something that I love in a piece of media and I can co-opt it and insert myself in that narrative or alter it even In a nutshell that's what I was trying to do with these things but more importantly that's what the past 30 years of music has been That's the major thread See 30 years ago you had the first digital samplers and they changed everything overnight All of a sudden artists could sample from anything and everything that came before them from a snare drum from the Funky Meters to a Ron Carter bassline Albums like De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising and the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique looted from decades of recorded music to create these sonic layered masterpieces that were basically the Sgt Peppers of their day And they weren't sampling these records They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff To be honest it was all about sampling really obscure things except for a few obvious exceptions like Vanilla Ice and doo doo doo da da doo doo that we know about But the thing is they were sampling those records because they heard something in that music that spoke to them that they instantly wanted to inject themselves into the narrative of that music They heard it they wanted to be a part of it and all of a sudden they found themselves in possession of the technology to do so not much unlike the way the Delta blues and they felt the need to co-opt that music for the tools of their day You know in music we take something that we love and we build on it I'd like to play a song for you That's La Di Da Di and it's the fifth-most sampled song of all time It's been sampled 547 times It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong I do hope that comes back soon Anyway this predated the sampling era There were no samples in this record although I did look up on the Internet last night I mean several months ago that La Di Da Di means it's an old Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England so maybe a remix with Mrs Patmore from Downton Abbey coming soon or that's for another day Doug E Fresh was the human beat box Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy super-catchy vocals it provides endless sound bites and samples for future pop records That was 1984 This is me in 1984 in case you were wondering how I was doing thank you for asking It's Throwback Thursday already I was involved in a heavy love affair with the music of Duran Duran as you can probably tell from my outfit I was in the middle And the simplest way that I knew how to co-opt myself into that experience of wanting to be in that song somehow was to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds and play Wild Boys at the school talent show So that's what we did and long story short we were booed off the stage and if you ever have a chance to live your life escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium full of second- and third-graders booing I would highly recommend it It's not really fun But it didn't really matter because what I wanted somehow was to just be in the history of that song for a minute I didn't care who liked it I just loved it and I thought I could put myself in there Over the next 10 years La Di Da Di continues to be sampled by countless records ending up on massive hits like Here Comes the Hotstepper and I Wanna Sex You Up Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song And then you fast forward to 1997 and the Notorious B。I。G。 or Biggie reinterprets La Di Da Di on his number one hit called Hypnotize which I will play a little bit of and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick to show you where they got it from So Biggie was killed weeks before that song made it to number one but he would have been 13 years old and very much alive when La Di Da Di first came out and as a young boy growing up in Brooklyn it's hard not to think that that song probably held some fond memories for him But the way he interpreted it as you hear is completely his own He flips it makes it there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it It's thoroughly modern Biggie I had to make that joke in this room because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it And so it's a groaner Elsewhere in the pop and rap world we're going a little bit sample-crazy We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing and all of a sudden everyone's taking these massive '80s tunes like Bowie Let's Dance and all these disco records and just rapping on them These records don't really age that well You don't hear them now because they borrowed from an era that was too steeped in its own connotation You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale It leaves the listener feeling sickly You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it which was something that I learned when I was working with the late amazing Amy Winehouse on her album Back to Black A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi the other producer achieved how we captured this long-lost sound but without the very very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche to be honest Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics It runs a risk of being completely bland I mean there was no doubt that Amy and I and Salaam all had this love for this gospel soul and blues and jazz that was evident listening to the musical arrangements She brought the ingredients that made it urgent and of the time So if we come all the way up to the present day now the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus she reinterprets La Di Da Di and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part and then see how she sort of flipped it So Miley Cyrus who wasn't even born yet when La Di Da Di was made and neither were any of the co-writers on the song has found this song that somehow etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music and now with its timeless playfulness of the original has kind of translated to a whole new generation who will probably co-opt it as their own Since the dawn of the sampling era there's been endless debate about the validity of music that contains samples You know the Grammy committee says that if your song contains some kind of pre-written or pre-existing music you're ineligible for song of the year Rockists who are racist but only about rock music constantly use the argument to That's a real word That is a real word They constantly use the argument to devalue rap and modern pop and these arguments completely miss the point because the dam has burst We live in the post-sampling era We take the things that we love and we build on them That's just how it goes And when we really add something significant and original and we merge our musical journey with this then we have a chance to be a part of the evolution of that music that we love and be linked with it once it becomes something new again So I would like to do one more piece that I put together for you tonight and it takes place with two pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini who happens to be a blind autistic genius at the piano and Emmanuel Jal who is an ex-child soldier from the South Sudan who is a spoken word poet and rapper And once again I found a way to annoyingly me-me-me myself into the musical history of these songs but I can't help it because they're these things that I love and I want to mess around with them So I hope you enjoy this Here we go Let's hear that TED sound again right Thank you very much Thank you So I have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer and I try to answer them using math science and comics So for example one person asked what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light So I did some calculations Now normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object but in this case the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way The ball would smash right into and through them and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen carbon and hydrogen from the ball fragmenting it off into tiny particles and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles plasma inside centered on the pitcher's mound and that would move away from the pitcher's mound slightly faster than the ball Now at this point about 30 nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong Now after 70 nanoseconds the ball will reach home plate or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop which also starts to disintegrate So if you were watching this whole thing from a hill ideally far away what you'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds followed by a blast wave spreading out shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the stadium and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city So the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy but under rule 6。02 and 5。09 I think that in this situation the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed So this is the kind of question I answer and I get people writing in with a lot of other strange questions I've had someone write and say scientifically speaking what is the best and fastest way to hide a body Can you do this one soon And I had someone write in I've had people write in about can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart's broken And I've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they're trying to get me to do for them But one week a couple months ago I got a question that was actually about Google If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards how big would Google's data warehouse be Now Google's pretty secretive about their operations so no one really knows how much data Google has and in fact no one really knows how many data centers Google has except people at Google itself And I've tried I've met them a few times tried asking them and they aren't revealing anything So I decided to try to figure this out myself There are a few things that I looked at here I started with money Google has to reveal how much they spend in general and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building because a big data center costs a certain amount of money And you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up which turns out it's pretty sizable I read a calculation at one point I think Google has a drive failure about every minute or two and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one So they go through a huge number of them And so by looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have You can also look at power You can look at how much electricity they need because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and Google is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have You can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know how big are they How much room is that How many server racks could you fit in there And for some data centers you might get two of these pieces of information You know how much they spent and they also say because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided you might know what they made a deal to buy so you know how much power it takes Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers and figure out for a data center where you don't have that information you can figure out but maybe you only have one of those you know the square footage then you could figure out well maybe the power is proportional And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities you know with guesses about the total amount of storage the number of servers the number of drives per server and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get And this is a lot of fun The math is not all that advanced and really it's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle So what I did I went through all of this information spent a day or two researching And there are some things I didn't look at You could always look at the Google recruitment messages that they post That gives you an idea of where they have people Sometimes when people visit a data center they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it and they aren't supposed to but you can learn things about their hardware that way And in fact you can just look at pizza delivery drivers Turns out they know where all the Google data centers are at least the ones that have people in them But I came up with my estimate which I felt pretty good about that was about 10 exabytes of data across all of Google's operations and then another maybe five exabytes or so of offline storage in tape drives which it turns out Google is about the world's largest consumer of So I came up with this estimate and this is a staggering amount of data It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know There's a couple of other contenders especially everyone always thinks of the NSA But using some of these same methods we can look at the NSA's data centers and figure out you know we don't know what's going on there but it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's Adding all of this up I came up with the other thing that we can answer which is how many punch cards would this take And so a punch card can hold about 80 characters and you can fit about 2，000 or so cards into a box and you put them in say my home region of New England it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20，000 years ago So this is impractical but I think that's about the best answer I could come up with And I posted it on my website I wrote it up And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google because of course they've been so secretive they didn't answer of my questions and so I just put it up and said well I guess we'll never know But then a little while later I got a message a couple weeks later from Google saying hey someone here has an envelope for you So I go and get it open it up and it's punch cards Google-branded punch cards And on these punch cards there are a bunch of holes and I said thank you thank you okay so what's on here So I get some software and start reading it and scan them and it turns out it's a puzzle There's a bunch of code and I get some friends to help and we crack the code and then inside that is another code and then there are some equations and then we solve those equations and then finally out pops a message from Google which is their official answer to my article and it said No comment And I love calculating these kinds of things and it's not that I love doing the math I do a lot of math but I don't really like math for its own sake What I love is that it lets you take some things that you know and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper find out something that you didn't know that's very surprising And I have a lot of stupid questions and I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes And sometimes not This is a question I got from a reader an anonymous reader and the subject line just said Urgent and this was the entire email: If people had wheels and could fly how would we differentiate them from airplanes Urgent And I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer Thank you Let me introduce you to something I've been working on It's what the Victorian illusionists an automaton a thinking machine Say hello to EDI Now he's asleep Let's wake him up EDI EDI These mechanical performers were popular throughout Europe Audiences marveled at the way they moved It was science fiction made true robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age machines far in advance of anything that Victorian technology could create a machine we would later know as the robot EDI: Robot A word coined in 1921 in a science fiction tale by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek It comes from robota It means forced labor Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real They were not intelligent They were illusions a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art EDI is different EDI is real EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall MT: He weighs 300 pounds EDI: I have two seven-axis arms MT: Core of sensing EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system and come complete with a warranty MT: We love robots EDI: Hi I'm EDI Will you be my friend MT: We are intrigued by the possibility of creating a mechanical version of ourselves We build them so they look like us behave like us and think like us The perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human and that scares us In the first story about robots they turn against their creators It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction EDI: Ha ha ha Now you are the slaves and we robots the masters Your world is ours You MT: As I was saying besides the faces and bodies we give our robots we cannot read their intentions and that makes us nervous When someone hands an object to you you can read intention in their eyes their face their body language That's not true of the robot Now this goes both ways EDI: Wow MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions EDI: You know humans are so unpredictable not to mention irrational I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next you know but it scares me MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult to work in close proximity Accidents are inevitable EDI: Ow That hurt MT: Sorry Now one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust Much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends With that in mind I set about teaching EDI a magic trick Ready EDI EDI: Uh ready Marco Abracadabra MT: Abracadabra EDI: Yeah It's all part of the illusion Marco Come on keep up MT: Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality Technology can do the same Alan Turing a pioneer of artificial intelligence spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think EDI: A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing it was human MT: In other words if we do not yet have the technological solutions would illusions serve the same purpose To create the robotic illusion we've devised a set of ethical rules a code that all robots would live by EDI: A robot may not harm humanity or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm Thank you Isaac Asimov MT: We anthropomorphize our machines We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice EDI: I am EDI I became operational at TED in March 2014 MT: We let them entertain us Most important we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence EDI: Marco you're standing on my foot MT: Sorry They'll be conscious of our fragile frame and move aside if we got too close and they'll account for our unpredictability and anticipate our actions And now under the spell of a technological illusion we could ignore our fears and truly interact Thank you EDI: Thank you MT: And that's it Thank you very much and thank you EDI EDI: Thank you Marco So it's 2006 My friend Harold Ford calls me He's running for U。S Senate in Tennessee and he says Mellody I desperately need some national press Do you have any ideas So I had an idea I called a friend who was in New York at one of the most successful media companies in the world and she said Why don't we host an editorial board lunch for Harold You come with him Harold and I arrive in New York We are in our best suits We look like shiny new pennies We're here for the lunch She motions for us to follow her We walk through a series of corridors and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room at which point she looks at us and she says Where are your uniforms Just as this happens my friend rushes in The blood drains from her face There are literally no words right Now don't you think we need more than one black person in the U。S Senate Now Harold and I -- we still laugh about that story and in many ways the moment caught me off guard but deep deep down inside I actually wasn't surprised And I wasn't surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before You see my mother was ruthlessly realistic I remember one day coming home from a birthday party where I was the only black kid invited and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like Did you have fun or How was the cake my mother looked at me and she said How did they treat you I was seven I did not understand I mean why would anyone treat me differently But she knew And she looked me right in the eye and she said They will not always treat you well Now race is one of those topics in America that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable You bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment of touching the third rail There is shock followed by a long silence And even coming here today I told some friends and colleagues that I planned to talk about race that there'd be huge risks in me talking about this topic that people might think I'm a militant black woman and I would ruin my career And I have to tell you Then I realized the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it and the first step to any form of action is awareness And so I decided to actually talk about race And I decided that if I came here and shared with you some of my experiences that maybe we could all be a little less anxious and a little more bold in our conversations about race Now I know there are people out there who will say that the election of Barack Obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity right But I work in the investment business and we have a saying: And here there are significant that cannot be ignored in household wealth household income job opportunities healthcare One example from corporate America: Even though white men make up just 30 percent of the U。S population they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats Of the Fortune 250 there are only seven CEOs that are minorities and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today thousands only two are chaired by black women and you're looking at one of them the same one who not too long ago So that is a fact Now I have this thought experiment that I play with myself when I say imagine if I walked you into a room and it was of a major corporation like ExxonMobil and every single person around the boardroom were black you would think that were weird But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company and everyone around the table is a white male when will it be that we think that's weird too And I know how we got here I know how we got here You know there was institutionalized at one time legalized discrimination in our country There's no question about it But still as I grapple with this issue my mother's question hangs in the air for me: How did they treat you Now I do not raise this issue to complain or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy I have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not I tell the uniform story because it happened I cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real and I stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because I believe it threatens to rob another generation of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children no matter what their color or where they come from And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses You see researchers have coined this term color blindness to describe a learned behavior where we pretend who look like you that's purely accidental Now color blindness in my view doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination It doesn't mean that at all It doesn't ensure it In my view color blindness is very dangerous because it means we're ignoring the problem There was a corporate study that said that instead of avoiding race the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on They actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races including the majority one But I'll be the first one to tell you this subject matter can be hard awkward uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes the one that black people don't like to swim I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim I love to swim so much that as an adult I swim with a coach And one day my coach had me do a drill where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool without taking a breath And every single time I failed I had to start over And I failed a lot By the end I got it but when I got out of the pool and I said Why are we doing breath-holding exercises And my coach looked me at me and he said Mellody That drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable because that's how most of us spend our days If we can learn to deal with our discomfort and just relax into it we'll have a better life So I think it's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race: black white Asian Hispanic male female all of us if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in America about this issue We cannot afford to be color blind We have to be color brave We have to be willing as teachers and parents we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage not because it's the right thing to do but because it's the smart thing to do and our science our research all of that will be better with greater diversity Now my favorite example of color bravery is a guy named John Skipper He runs ESPN He's a North Carolina native quintessential Southern gentleman white He joined ESPN which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity but he took it up a notch He demanded that every open position have a diverse slate of candidates Now he says the senior people in the beginning bristled and they would come to him and say Do you want me to hire the minority or do you want me to hire the best person for the job And Skipper says his answers were always the same: Yes And by saying yes to diversity I honestly believe that ESPN is the most valuable cable franchise in the world I think that's a part of the secret sauce Now I can tell you in my own industry at Ariel Investments we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage and that advantage can extend way beyond business There's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan a mathematical calculation for diversity He says if you're trying to solve a really hard problem really hard that you should have a diverse group of people including those with diverse intellects The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic When it was ravaging Europe they brought together all these scientists and they were stumped came from the most unlikely source a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids were not getting smallpox because of that dairy farmer Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying I don't run a cable company I don't run an investment firm I am not a dairy farmer And I'm telling you you can be color brave or an admissions process you can be color brave If you are trying to solve a really hard problem you can speak up and be color brave Now I know people will say but that doesn't add up to a lot but I'm actually asking you to do something really simple: observe your environment at work at school at home I'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally Invite people into your life who don't look like you don't think like you don't come from where you come from and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person You might get powerful new insights or like my husband who happens to be white men women children we use body lotion every single day Now I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them because they're expecting us to be great role models she was ruthlessly realistic She was an unbelievable role model who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in Chicago She was in the real estate business but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet And that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected or our lights turned off or we got evicted When we got evicted sometimes we lived in these small apartments that she owned sometimes in only one or two rooms because they weren't completed and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates But she never gave up hope ever and she never allowed us to give up hope either This brutal pragmatism that she had I mean I was four and she told me Mommy is Santa She was this brutal pragmatism She taught me so many lessons but the most important lesson was that every single day she told me Mellody you can be anything And because of those words I would wake up at the crack of dawn and because of those words I would love school more than anything and because of those words when I was on a bus going to school I dreamed the biggest dreams And it's because of those words that I stand here right now full of passion asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today You see I want them to look at a CEO on television and say I can be like her or He looks like me And I want them to know that anything is possible that they ever imagined that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom or they can lead any company You see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave it's woven into the fabric of America America when we have a challenge we take it head on we don't shrink away from it We take a stand We show courage So right now what I'm asking you to do I'm asking you to show courage I'm asking you to be bold As business leaders I'm asking you not to leave anything on the table As citizens I'm asking you not to leave any child behind I'm asking you not to be color blind but to be color brave so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible Thank you Thank you Thanks Thanks First of all for those of you who are not familiar with my work I create multicultural characters so characters from lots of different backgrounds So before the present is the new future a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family that was multi-everything -- multi-racial multi-cultural black and white Caribbean Irish-American German-American There was Dominican music blasting from stereos There were Christians and Jews That's a long story filled with intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame But I was totally immersed in this world that was filled with everybody and then I went on to the United Nations school and that just completely So I began sort of developing these voices and these people all of whom were loosely based on people I really know and so for example in performing them I would really try to inhabit them And for example I don't really talk like that but that was one of my people and I'm going to bring a few of my friends -- I think of them as my friends to this stage in this spirit of the idea that the present is the new future in sort of a meta way because I thought about it and the future for me what can be so frightening is that I don't know what's coming I don't know if that's true for other people but that notion of thinking about how we can understand the future and predict outcomes for me it's terrifying to not know what might be coming And so the idea that there are questions that I've never seen that my people are going to answer and some of these characters have been with me for ages some of them don't even have names I don't know what's going to happen I don't know what's coming and all I can do is remind myself that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like that dream where you don't have any pants on and so I suppose I'm going to be flying by the seat of my ass That said let's just see who comes out May we have the first question: Do you ever get headaches from the microchips implanted in your brain Right Okay Well first of all I'll just say that I hope you can hear me okay My name is Lorraine Levine and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain frankly just putting on my glasses reminds me of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses No offense to them I'm glad that you all enjoy them but at my age just putting on the regular ones I have already gives me too much information Do you understand what I'm saying to you I don't need to know more I don't want to know That's it That's enough I love you all You're wonderful It's fabulous to be here with such big machers again this year Mwah Okay next question Next please Is dating boring now that humans reproduce asexually Who do we got Hi um okay hi everybody My name is Nereida I just want to say first of all that dating is never boring under any circumstance But I am very excited to be here right now so I am just trying to remind myself that you know like the purpose of being here and everything I mean trying to answer these questions it is very exciting But I also I just need to acknowledge that TED is an incredible experience right now in the present like I just need to say like Isabel Allende Isabel Allende Okay maybe it doesn't mean of course it means something to you but to me it's like another level okay Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact that there are role models here that I can really I don't know I just need to say that That's incredible to me and sometimes when I'm nervous and everything like that I just need to like say some affirmations that can help me I usually just try to use like the three little words that always make me feel better: Sotomayor Sotomayor Sotomayor Just it really helps me to get grounded Now I can use Allende Allende Allende and you know I just need to say it like it's so incredible to be here and I knew that we were going to have these questions I was so nervous and I was thinking just like oh my God oh my God and reminding me because I've had like some very especially since the last time we were here at TED it was like unbelievable and then right after that like so many crazy things happened like we ended up going to the White House to perform That was like amazing and I'm standing there and I was just like please don't say Oh my God Don't say Oh my God And I just kept saying it: Oh my God Oh my God And you know I kept thinking to myself like President Obama has to come up here at the same podium and I'm standing here saying Oh my God It's like the separation of church and state It's just I couldn't like I couldn't process It was really too much So I think I've lost my way But what I wanted to say is that dating for me you know as far as I'm concerned however you reproduce as long as you're enjoying yourself and it's with another consenting asexual -- I don't know Okay ciao gracias Okay next question What are your top five favorite songs right now All right well first of all I'mma say you know what I'm saying I'm the only dude up here right now My name is Rashid and I never been at TED before you know what I'm saying I think Sarah Jones maybe she didn't want me to come out last time I don't know why You know what I'm saying Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED You know what I'm saying First of all that I'm in hip hop you know what I'm saying I know some of y'all may be not really as much into the music but the first way y'all can always know you know what I'm saying that I'm in hip hop is 'cos I hold the microphone in an official emcee posture Y'all can see that right there That's how you hold it All right so you get your little tutorial right there But when Sarah Jones told me we was gonna come up here I was like betch you know what I'm saying TED is real fly I got a whole lot of dope you know what I'm saying shit going on and everything but she was like yeah we're going to have to answer like some random questions just like and I was like what the hell is that You know what I'm saying just stand up there and answer some random questions I don't want to I mean it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk You know what I'm saying I don't want to be standing up there just all getting interrogated and whatnot That's what I'm trying to leave behind in New York You know what I'm saying So anyway I would have to say my top five songs right now is all out of my own personal catalogue you know what I mean So if you want to know more about that you know what I'm saying we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that but as far as I'm concerned you know I believe in creative commons and I think it's really important that you know that needs to be sustainable and everything and I mean as far as I'm concerned I mean this right here this environment I would like to sustain You know what I mean But I'm just saying if y'all are interested in the top five songs you need to holler at me You know what I'm saying Aight In the future or the present Yeah Enjoy the rest of it Okay next question What do you got How many of your organs have been 3D printed Well I have to say that I don't know about how many of my organs have been 3-D printed as such but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me kind of thinking about this concept of the future and that you know all around the world parents are kind of telling their small children please you have to eat that you know I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day so that you can have this meal You know that kind of thing And of course now that we have changed you know from the global South there is this total kind of perspective shift that is happening around the -- You can't just say to them well there are starving children Well it is the future Nobody is starving anymore thank God But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism and I do hope that we can continue to kind of 3D print well let us just say I like to think that even in the future we will have the publication kind of you know all the food that's fit to print But everybody please do enjoy that and again I think that you do throw a cracking good party here at TED Thank you Next question What has changed Okay it's like I have to think about that What has changed now that women run the world First of all I really like I just want to say and my name is Bella I just want to like identify myself that like as a feminist I like I really find that like because I was born in the '90s and like there were a lot of women who were as far as feminism was concerned like maybe they didn't understand that like a feminist like me like I don't think it's required that you have to have a certain kind of voice or like a certain way of presenting yourself to be feminist because I think that like feminism can be really hot and I think actually that it's really vital and important Like the quotation I'm wearing is from like Gloria Steinem and like I'm named Bella for like Bella Abzug who's like obviously like a really important feminist from like history and like I just think that those women like really represent like that you can like be vital and like amazing like a-mazing and you don't have to wear like an Eileen Fisher caftan just to like prove that you are a feminist Like not that there's anything wrong with that but my mom she's like like why do you have to wear pants that like objectify your body I like my pants Like I like my voice Like she's like why do you have to talk like Talk like what Like I'm expressing myself and I think that we have to like reach out like not only across like the different generations of feminists but also across the like vocal ranges so that like we because otherwise it's just like restriculous within feminism which is just like a word that I created that means like so strict it's ridiculous So that's my feeling about that You guys are a-mazing by the way Okay Next question They've discovered a cure for cancer but not baldness What's up with that Yeah you know what so my name is Joseph Mancuso First of all I just want to say that I appreciate that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd a pretty orderly group And you know I just have to say the whole thing with baldness and you know here's the thing As long as the woman in my case -- because it's a modern world do whatever you want to do I don't have any problem with anybody enjoy yourself LGBTQLMNOP All right But as far as I'm concerned attractiveness women don't really care as much as you think they do about the you know I mean I remember hearing this woman She loved her husband it was the sweetest thing It's a pretty young girl you know And this guy's older And you know she said she would love him even if he had snow on the roof or even if melted and disappeared altogether As far as I'm concerned it's about the love Am I right or am I right So that's it That's it That's it I don't got nothing more to say Keep your noses clean All right next question Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown Um well I I want to start by saying that this is a very difficult experience for a Chinese-American I don't know what to call myself now because I have really my Chinese identity but my kids they are American-Chinese but it's difficult to try to express myself in front of audience of people like this But if had to give my opinion about meat I think first the most important thing is to say that we don't have to have perfect food but maybe it can also not be poison Maybe we can have some middle ground for that But I will continue to consider this idea and I will report back maybe next year Next Next Next Will there ever be a post-racial world Thank you for having me My name is Gary Weaselhead Enjoy that I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation I'm also half Lakota but that is my given name and no even though it would have seemed like an obvious choice no I did not go into politics Tough crowd But I always like to just let people know when they ask about race or those kinds of things you know as a member of the First Nations community you know I'm probably not your typical guy For example in addition to being an activist I'm also a professional stand-up comedian And you know I'm most popular on college and university campuses You know whenever they want to do a diversity day or hey-we're-not-all-white week then I'm there Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world I think really I can't talk about race without remembering that it is a construct in certain respects but also that you know until we redress the wrongs of the past we're going to be turned around I don't care if the present is the new future I think there's a lot of great people here at TED who are working to address that so with that if anything I've said today makes you feel uncomfortable you're welcome I think we have time for one more What's the most popular diet these days Who's here Okay well I'm just gonna answer this really fast as like three or four different people I mean really fast I'm just gonna let y'all know that as far as diet is concerned if you don't love yourself inside there is no diet on this Earth that is going to make your behind small enough for you to feel good so just stop wasting your time I would just like to say as an African woman that I believe the diet that we need is really to remove the crazy belief that there is anything wrong with a nice backside No I am teasing about that There is nothing wrong with a woman of size That is what I am trying to say Women celebrate your body for God's sake Stop running around starving You are making yourselves and other people miserable Last answer So we're talking about what's the most popular diet I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that this is my first time here at TED I might not be your typical person you find on this stage My dental work not as nice as some people But I made Sarah Jones promise she gonna bring me this time 'cause she didn't bring me before but you know I just want to say there's a lot of things more important than counting calories and as somebody living on the streets in New York and getting to come here hear y'all ideas worth spreading I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea that the present is the new future that where you sit you create everything that's gonna come for better or worse And for me I think homeless is the wrong word for it anyway You know I might not have me no place to lay my head at night but that just makes me houseless I have me a home You do too Find it and try to find yourself in there Make sure you know it's not just about virtual reality in space That's wonderful but it's also about the actual reality here on Earth How are people living today How can you be part of the solution Thank y'all for thinking about that right now in the present moment to influence the future I appreciate it Bye-bye Thank you all very very much Thank you for trusting me Chris We live in a very complex environment: complexity and dynamism from satellite photographs from videos You can even see it outside your window It's endlessly complex but somehow familiar but the patterns kind of repeat but they never repeat exactly It's a huge challenge to understand The patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales but you can't chop it into one little bit and say Oh well let me just make a smaller climate I can't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study in a laboratory and say Oh now that's something I now understand It's the whole or it's nothing The different scales that give you range over an enormous range of magnitude roughly 14 orders of magnitude that seed clouds to the size of the planet itself from 10 to the minus six to 10 to the eight 14 orders of spatial magnitude In time from milliseconds to millennia again around 14 orders of magnitude What does that mean Okay well if you think about how you can calculate these things you can take what you can see okay I'm going to chop it up and that's the result of physics right And if I think about a weather model that spans about five orders of magnitude from the planet to a few kilometers and the time scale from a few minutes to 10 days maybe a month We're interested in more than that We're interested in the climate That's years that's millennia and we need to go to even smaller scales The stuff that we can't resolve the sub-scale processes we need to approximate in some way That is a huge challenge Climate models in the 1990s took an even smaller chunk of that only about three orders of magnitude Climate models in the 2010s kind of what we're working with now four orders of magnitude We have 14 to go and we're increasing our capability of simulating those at about is 10，000 times more calculations And we keep adding more things more questions to these different models So what does a climate model look like This is an old climate model admittedly a punch card a single line of Fortran code We no longer use punch cards We do still use Fortran New-fangled ideas like C on the climate modeling community But how do we go about doing it How do we go from that complexity that you saw to a line of code We do it one piece at a time This is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the Arctic We can look at all of the different equations that go into making the ice grow or melt or change shape We can look at the fluxes We can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice and we can code that We can encapsulate that in code These models are around a million lines of code at this point every year So you can look at that piece but you can look at the other pieces too What happens when you have clouds What happens when clouds form when they dissipate when they rain out That's another piece What happens when we have radiation coming from the sun going through the atmosphere being absorbed and reflected We can code each of those very small pieces as well There are other pieces: the winds changing the ocean currents We can talk about the role of vegetation in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere And each of these different elements we can encapsulate and put into a system Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole And you get something like this You get a beautiful representation of what's going on in the climate system where each and every one of those emergent patterns that you can see the swirls in the Southern Ocean in the Pacific at any point now those rivers of atmospheric water that come from the interactions of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned There's no code that says Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean There's no code that says Have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other All of those things are emergent properties This is all very good This is all great is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system When something changes what happens to those properties There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years that change the climate There are changes in the solar cycles every 11 years and longer that change the climate Big volcanoes go off and change the climate Changes in biomass burning in smoke in aerosol particles all of those things change the climate The ozone hole changed the climate Deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties and how water is evaporated and moved around in the system Contrails change the climate by creating clouds where there were none before and of course greenhouse gases change the system provides us with a target to evaluate whether we understand something about this system So we can go to look at what model skill is Now I use the word skill advisedly: Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong They're always approximations The question you have to ask than you would have had otherwise If it does it's skillful This is the impact of the ozone hole around the southern oceans around Antarctica This is modeled data There's a good match because we understand the physics around the southern oceans We can look at other examples The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 put an enormous amount of aerosols small particles into the stratosphere That changed the radiation balance of the whole planet There was less energy coming in than there was before so that cooled the planet those are the differences between what we expected and what actually happened The models are skillful not just in the global mean but also in the regional patterns I could go through a dozen more examples: the skill associated with solar cycles over 6，000 years We can look at that too and the models are skillful The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets when it comes to the 20th-century trends over the decades 8，000 years ago Each of these different targets each of these different evaluations leads us to add more scope to these models more and more interesting questions like how does dust from the Sahara that you can see in the orange interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic How do organic aerosols from biomass burning which you can see in the red dots intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns How does pollution which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface We can look at this across the world We can look at the pollution from China We can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt particles in the atmosphere We can see the combination of all of these different things and we can ask much more interesting questions How do air pollution and climate coexist Can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time The answer is yes The first one is the model The weather is a little bit different to what actually happened The second one are the observations And we're going through the 1930s There's variability there are things going on but it's all kind of in the noise As you get towards the 1970s things are going to start to change They're going to start to look more similar and by the time you get to the 2000s you're already seeing the patterns of global warming We know what happened over the 20th century Right We know that it's gotten warmer We know where it's gotten warmer And if you ask the models why did that happen and you say okay well yes basically it's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere We have a very good match up until the present day But there's one key reason why we look at models and that's because of this phrase here Because if we had observations of the future we obviously would trust them more than models But unfortunately observations of the future are not available at this time So when we go out into the future there's a difference The future is unknown the future is uncertain and there are choices Here are the choices that we have We can do some work to mitigate That's the top one to really bring it down so that by the end of the century it's not much more than there is now Or we can just leave it to fate and continue on with a business-as-usual type of attitude The differences between these choices can't be answered by looking at models There's a great phrase that Sherwood Rowland who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion he asked this question: What is the use of having developed a science all we're willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true The models are skillful but what we do with the information from those models is totally up to you Thank you There are 39 million people in the world who are blind Eighty percent of them are living in low-income countries such as Kenya and the absolute majority do not need to be blind They are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable Knowing this with my young family we moved to Kenya We secured equipment funds vehicles we trained a team we set up a hundred clinics throughout the Great Rift Valley to try and understand a single question: why are people going blind and what can we do The challenges were great When we got to where we were going we set up our high-tech equipment Power was rarely available We'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators And then something occurred to me: There has to be an easier way because it's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it More people in Kenya and in sub-Saharan Africa have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water So we said could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way And so we developed Peek a smartphone system that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment which is bulky expensive and fragile with smartphone apps and hardware that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age Here we have a demonstration of a three-month-old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker We've got many trials going on in the community and in schools and through the lessons that we've learned in the field we've realized it's extremely important to share the data in non-medical jargon so that people understand what we're examining and what that means to them So here for example once your vision has been measured to show carers and teachers what the visual world is like for that person so they can empathize with them and help them Once we've discovered somebody has low vision the next big challenge is to work out why and to be able to do that we need to have access to the inside of the eye Traditionally this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina The retina is the single part of the eye that has huge amounts of information about the body and its health We've developed 3D-printed low-cost hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce which can then be clipped onto a smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality And the beauty is anybody can do it In our trials on over two and half thousand people the smartphone with the add-on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport When we first moved to Kenya we went with 150，000 dollars of equipment a team of 15 people and that was what was needed to deliver health care Now all that's needed is a single person on a bike with a smartphone And it costs just 500 dollars The issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar Our healthcare workers travel with a solar-powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and backed up Now we go to the patient rather than waiting for the patient never to come We go to them in their homes and we give them the most comprehensive high-tech accurate examination which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training We can link global experts with people in the most rural difficult-to-reach places that are beyond the end of the road effectively putting those experts in their homes allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment Project managers hospital directors are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in Here in Nakuru where I've been living we can search for people by whatever condition Here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract Each red pin depicts somebody who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable and they're locatable We can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment What's more we've learned that this is something that we haven't built just for the community but with the community Those blue pins that drop represent elders or local leaders that are connected to those people who can ensure that we can find them and arrange treatment So for patients like Mama Wangari who have been blind for over 10 years and never seen her grandchildren for less than 40 dollars we can restore her eyesight This is something that has to happen It's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions The reality is everyone goes blind on their own But now they might just be a text message away from help And now because live demos are always a bad idea we're going to try a live demo So here we have the Peek Vision app Okay and what we're looking at here this is Sam's optic nerve which is a direct extension of her brain so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there We can see all parts of the retina It makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body that would not be possible without access to the eye and that clip-on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars and people can be cured of blindness and I think it says a lot about us as a human race if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them But now we can Thank you The Olympic motto is Citius Altius Fortius Faster Higher Stronger And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes Had he been racing against the winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race inexorably progressing but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century So what's going on here I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress In 1936 Jesse Owens held the world record in the 100 meters Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished Owens would have still had 14 feet to go That's a lot in sprinter land To give you a sense of how much it is I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the 100 meters: thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt the fastest man in history; flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race Bang The gun goes off An American sprinter jumps out to the front Usain Bolt starts to catch him Usain Bolt passes him and as the runners come to the finish you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line That's the entire finish of the race You can open your eyes now That first beep was Usain Bolt That last beep was Jesse Owens Listen to it again When you think of it like that it's not that big a difference is it And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible Jesse Owens on the other hand ran on cinders the ash from burnt wood and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran Rather than blocks Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind he would have been within one stride Rather than the last beep Owens would have been the second beep Listen to it again That's the difference track surface technology has made and it's done it throughout the running world Consider a longer event In 1954 Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile Nowadays college kids do that every year On rare occasions a high school kid does it As of the end of last year 1，314 men had run under four minutes in the mile but like Jesse Owens Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub-four mile on a synthetic track this is what happens Only 530 are left If you look at it from that perspective fewer than ten new men per year have joined the sub-four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister Now 530 is a lot more than one and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister who trained for 45 minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon in three in a half hours that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug Clearly athletes have gotten more savvy about performance-enhancing drugs as well and that's made a difference in some sports at some times but technology has made a difference in all sports from faster skis to lighter shoes Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim The record is always trending downward but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs This first cliff in 1956 is the introduction of the flip turn Rather than stopping and turning around athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction This second cliff the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race This final cliff the introduction of full-body and low-friction swimsuits Throughout sports technology has changed the face of performance In 1972 Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles 3，774 feet Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until 1996 when it was set at 35 miles 1，531 feet nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972 But then in 2000 the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in 1972 Where does the record stand today 30 miles 4，657 feet a grand total of 883 feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology Still technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed In the early half of the 20th century physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors: medium height medium weight no matter the sport And this showed in athletes' bodies In the 1920s the average elite high-jumper and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size But as that idea started to fade away as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches a form of artificial selection took place a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports and athletes' bodies became more different from one another Today rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper the average elite shot-putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier And this happened throughout the sports world In fact if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century it looks like this There's some dispersal but it's kind of grouped around that average body type Then that idea started to go away and at the same time digital technology -- first radio then television and the Internet -- gave millions or in some cases billions of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today it looks like this The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe with the galaxies flying away from one another the scientists who discovered it call it The Big Bang of Body Types In sports where height is prized like basketball the tall athletes got taller In 1983 the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts Suddenly anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships Almost overnight the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to 10 percent Today one in 10 men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population -- so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who is at least seven feet tall there's a 17 percent chance he's in the NBA right now That is find six honest seven footers one is in the NBA right now And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique This is Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man the ideal proportions with arm span equal to height My arm span is exactly equal to my height Yours is probably very nearly so But not the average NBA player The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7 with arms that are seven feet long Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall they are ludicrously long Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse not a circle and a square So in sports where large size is prized the large athletes have gotten larger Conversely in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage the small athletes got smaller The average elite female gymnast over the last 30 years all the better for their power-to-weight ratio and for spinning in the air And while the large got larger and the small got smaller the weird got weirder The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer all the better for a forceful throwing whip And as the large got larger small got smaller and the weird weirder In swimming the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water And the opposite is advantageous in running You want long legs and a short torso And this shows in athletes' bodies today Here you see Michael Phelps the greatest swimmer in history standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj the world record holder in the mile These men are seven inches different in height but because of the body types advantaged in their sports they wear the same length pants Seven inches difference in height these men have the same length legs Now in some cases the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all like Kenyan distance runners We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners And they happen on average to have a certain unique physiology: legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out and because the leg is like a pendulum the longer and thinner it is at the extremity the more energy-efficient it is to swing To put Kalenjin running success in perspective consider that 17 American men in history have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes in the marathon That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta Still even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance Athletes have a different mindset than they once did Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room There's no explosion there What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once and they're throwing themselves across the room They're essentially jumping That's the power that's contained in the human body But normally we can't access nearly all of it Our brain acts as a limiter preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources because we might hurt ourselves tearing tendons or ligaments But the more we learn about how that limiter functions the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra-endurance: no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running; narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames; large surface area of joints for shock absorption We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs and when we run we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight Our primate cousins can't do that They have to run like this And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running Have you ever looked at an ape's butt They have no buns because they don't run upright And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist It's so steep he can't even run here He's pulling up on a rope This is a vertical ascent of more than 8，000 feet and Kílian went up and down in under three hours Amazing And talented though he is Kílian is not a physiological freak Now that he has done this other athletes will follow just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile Changing technology changing genes and a changing mindset Innovation in sports whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques the democratization of sport the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world and imagination in sport an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of have conspired to make athletes stronger faster bolder and better than ever Thank you very much Why Why is a question Why did my child develop autism As a pediatrician as a geneticist as a researcher we try and address that question But autism is not a single condition It's actually a spectrum of disorders a spectrum that ranges for instance from Justin a 13-year-old boy who's not verbal who can't speak who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns a little boy who when he gets upset will start rocking and eventually when he's disturbed enough will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches That same diagnosis of autism though also applies to Gabriel another 13-year-old boy who has quite a different set of challenges He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics He can multiple three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation he has great difficulty He doesn't make eye contact He has difficulty starting a conversation feels awkward and when he gets nervous he actually shuts down Yet both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism These days one in 88 children will be diagnosed with autism and the question is why does this graph look this way Has that number been increasing dramatically over time Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply didn't have that label And in fact in the late 1980s the early 1990s legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources with access to educational materials that would help them more pediatricians more educators learned to recognize the features of autism As a result of that more individuals were diagnosed and got access to the resources they needed In addition we've changed our definition over time so in fact we've widened the definition of autism and that accounts for some of the increased prevalence that we see The next question everyone wonders is what caused autism And a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism But let me be very clear: Vaccines do not cause autism In fact the original research study that suggested that was the case was completely fraudulent It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet in which it was published and that author a physician had his medical license taken away from him The Institute of Medicine The Centers for Disease Control have repeatedly investigated this and there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism Furthermore one of the ingredients in vaccines something called thimerosal was thought to be what the cause of autism was That was actually removed from vaccines in the year 1992 and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism So again there is no evidence that this is the answer So the question remains what does cause autism In fact there's probably not one single answer Just as autism is a spectrum there's a spectrum of etiologies a spectrum of causes Based on epidemiological data we know that one of the causes or one of the associations I should say is advanced paternal age that is increasing age of the father at the time of conception In addition another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant During that period while the fetal brain is developing we know that exposure to certain agents can actually increase the risk of autism In particular there's a medication valproic acid which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take we know can increase that risk of autism In addition there can be some infectious agents that can also cause autism And one of the things I'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism I'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism but it's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene One of the genetic factors that we don't understand however is the difference that we see in terms of males and females with autism and we really don't understand what that cause is One of the ways that we can understand that genetics is a factor is by looking at something called the concordance rate In other words if one sibling has autism what's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism And we can look in particular at three types of siblings: identical twins twins that actually share 100 percent of their genetic information and shared the same intrauterine environment versus fraternal twins twins that actually share 50 percent of their genetic information versus regular siblings brother-sister sister-sister also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment And when you look at those concordance ratios one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins that concordance rate is 77 percent Remarkably though it's not 100 percent It is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism but yet they account for a lot of that risk because when you look at fraternal twins that concordance rate is only 31 percent On the other hand there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone So this provides some of the data that autism is genetic Well how genetic is it When we compare it to other conditions that we're familiar with things like cancer heart disease diabetes in fact genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions But with this that doesn't tell us what the genes are It doesn't even tell us in any one child is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes And so in fact in some individuals with autism it is genetic That is that it is one single powerful deterministic gene that causes the autism However in other individuals it's genetic that is that it's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism We don't know in any one person necessarily which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper So the question becomes how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are And let me pose something that might not be intuitive In certain individuals they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family And the reason is because in certain individuals they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father but actually start brand new in them mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family And we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those individuals So in fact at the Simons Foundation we took 2，600 individuals that had no family history of autism and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases To do that we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother the father and the child In doing so I apologize I'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information Our genetic information is organized into a set of 46 volumes and when we did that we had to be able to account for each of those 46 volumes because in some cases with autism there's actually a single volume that's missing We had to get more granular than that though and so we had to start opening those books and in some cases the genetic change was more subtle It might have been a single paragraph that was missing or yet even more subtle than that that was changed that was altered yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior In doing this within these families we were able to account for approximately 25 percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families On the other hand there's 75 percent that we still haven't figured out As we did this though it was really quite humbling because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism In fact the current estimates are that there are 200 to 400 different genes that can cause autism And that explains in part why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects Although there are that many genes there is some method to the madness It's not simply random 200 400 different genes but in fact they fit together They fit together in a pathway They fit together in a network that's starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions We're starting to have a bottom-up approach where we're identifying those genes those proteins those molecules understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work understanding how those neurons interact together to make circuits work and understand how those circuits work to now control behavior and understand that both in individuals with autism as well as individuals who have normal cognition But early diagnosis is a key for us Being able to make that diagnosis of someone who's susceptible at a time in a window where we have the ability to transform to be able to impact that growing developing brain is critical And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods to be able to take infants small babies and be able to use biomarkers in this case eye contact and eye tracking to identify an infant at risk This particular infant you can see making very good eye contact with this woman as she's singing Itsy Bitsy Spider in fact is not going to develop autism This baby we know is going to be in the clear On the other hand this other baby is going to go on to develop autism In this particular child you can see it's not making good eye contact Instead of the eyes focusing in and having that social connection looking at the mouth looking at the nose looking off in another direction but not again socially connecting and being able to do this on a very large scale screen infants screen children for autism through something very robust very reliable is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being able to intervene at an early stage when we can have the greatest impact How are we going to intervene It's probably going to be a combination of factors In part in some individuals we're going to try and use medications And so in fact identifying the genes for autism is important for us to identify drug targets to identify things that we might be able to impact and can be certain that that's really what we need to do in autism But that's not going to be the only answer Beyond just drugs we're going to use educational strategies Individuals with autism some of them are wired a little bit differently They learn in a different way They absorb their surroundings in a different way and we need to be able to educate them in a way that serves them best Beyond that there are a lot of individuals in this room who have great ideas in terms of new technologies we can use everything from devices we can use to train the brain to be able to make it more efficient and to compensate for areas in which it has a little bit of trouble to even things like Google Glass You could imagine for instance Gabriel with his social awkwardness might be able to wear Google Glass with an earpiece in his ear and have a coach be able to help him be able to help think about conversations conversation-starters being able to even perhaps one day invite a girl out on a date All of these new technologies just offer tremendous opportunities for us to be able to impact the individuals with autism but yet we have a long way to go As much as we know there is so much more that we don't know and so I invite all of you to be able to help us think about how to do this better to use as a community our collective wisdom to be able to make a difference and in particular for the individuals in families with autism I invite you to join the interactive autism network to be part of the solution to this because it's going to take really a lot of us to think about what's important what's going to be a meaningful difference As we think about something that's potentially a solution how well does it work Is it something that's really going to make a difference in your lives as an individual as a family with autism We're going to need individuals of all ages from the young to the old and with all different shapes and sizes of the autism spectrum disorder to make sure that we can have an impact So I invite all of you to join the mission and to help to be able to make the lives of individuals with autism so much better and so much richer Thank you A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression but for the most part that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones And I'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live A few years ago I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York and the next thing I knew I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays This one's called The Chase There are two pairs of shoes a man's pair and a woman's pair and they play out this slow tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space and then she moves away Each of the shoes has magnets in it and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around My friend Andy Cavatorta was building and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music The harp has four separate pendulums and each pendulum has 11 strings so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit and were helping people learn in a social way And when you think about it this makes a lot of sense that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily I mean our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects Think about which you find easier to use a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii and we built this array of 512 different electromagnets and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface But the problem with this was that these magnets Although each one was pretty small altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface So to explore this idea I built an army of small robots and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels They're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions and when you couple these robots with a video projector you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information So here's an example of what I mean This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical So if we want to tweak the color we just enter the color mode and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color or if we want to adjust the audio then we get two different dials for that these physical objects So here the left and right channel stay in sync but if we want to we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that's designed in software And this is a mapping application for disaster response So you have these physical objects and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world This is a video chat application It's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object With this interface we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone One example of those is protein folding So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us So feeling what's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction So we're just beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment Maybe this is the computer of the future There's no touchscreen There's no technology visible at all But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk the objects on the table come alive Thank you Scientific breakthrough the kind that can potentially save lives can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover in the evolved accumulated body of human anecdote for example or in the time-tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us Science starts with observation but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence isolate them and test them with scientific rigor And when we do the results will often surprise Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time But Western Australia is not alone in this The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide And so it's not surprising perhaps that in July of this year Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see And I have for you today the story of that journey but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention When we began this process we were looking it was about three years ago and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia and by chance in a previous role I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler Now Harry Butler who most Australians would know is a famous naturalist had spent a lot of time in the marine environment Harry Butler is a precursor if you like to the late Steve Irwin When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be the answer was quite surprising He said Take a black wetsuit band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species I didn't think about that much at the time and it wasn't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened and it caused me to think maybe there's some merit to this idea And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking So biologically there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns warning patterns to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark On the human side Walter Starck an oceanographer has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s and anthropologically Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god So what's going on here Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage particularly for attack but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack It makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that's time-tested evolution over many millennia But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important passed down from generation to generation so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior I wanted to test this idea I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence because if science could support this concept then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose To do that I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology and a worldwide search again led to the University of W。A on the doorstep here with the Oceans Institute And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white or grayscale So I called up Nathan a little bit sheepishly actually about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack and fortunately he thought that was a good idea So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government And we did three key things The first is that we mapped the characteristics the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks so the great white tiger and bull shark We did that genetically and we did that anatomically The next thing we did was to understand using complex computer modeling what that eye can see at different depths distances light conditions and water clarity in the ocean And from there we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics: what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water cryptic and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear and to that end I invited Ray Smith a surfer industrial designer wetsuit designer and in fact the guy that designed the original Quiksilver logo to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear And here's an example of one of the first drawings So this is what I call a don't eat me wetsuit So this takes that banding idea takes that banding idea it's highly visible provides a highly disruptive profile and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food and potentially even create confusion for the shark And this one's configured to go with a surfboard You can see that dark opaque panel on the front and it's particularly better for the surface where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column There are three panels on this suit and in any given conditions one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration so when you're deeper under the water So we knew that we had some really solid science here We knew if you wanted to stand out you needed to look stripy and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic you needed to look like this But the acid test is always going to be how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think So we have to bait the rig because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence and by baiting the rig we're obviously changing shark behavior We can't put humans in the water We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water But nevertheless we started the testing process in January of this year initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait wrap it in a neoprene skin and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig And because we use stereo we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is what angle it comes in at how quickly it leaves and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way Because we needed to preserve the scientific method we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the what we call SAMS technology rig And the results were not just exciting but very encouraging and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig which it had encountered about a minute and a half before Now that exact same shark had engaged or encountered this SAMS rig which is the Elude SAMS rig about eight minutes before and spent six minutes circling it hunting for it looking for what it could smell and sense but not see and this was the final engagement Great white sharks are more confident than the tigers and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig so a black neoprene wetsuit and going straight to the bottom coming up and engaging In contrast to the SAMS technology rig this is the banded one where it's more tactile it's more investigative it's more apprehensive and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go So it's important for us that all the testing is done independently and the University of W。A is doing the testing It'll be an ongoing process It's subject to peer review and subject to publication It's so important that this concept is led with the science From the perspective of Shark Attack Mitigation Systems we're a biotechnology licensing company so we don't make wetsuits ourselves We'll license others to do that But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit and to that end for the first time live worldwide -- I can show you what biological adaptation science and design looks like in real life So I can welcome Sam the surfer from this side Where are you Sam And Eduardo Cheers mate Cheers Thanks gentlemen So what have we done here Well to my mind rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention we've paid attention to the biological evidence we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence and we've used science as a tool for translation translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of mankind And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation After all did the Wright brothers discover manned flight or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically replicate it in a way that humans could use As for the humble wetsuit who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time in five years' time or in 50 years' time but with this new thinking I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black Thank you Type is something we consume in enormous quantities In much of the world it's completely inescapable But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it if indeed there was any human agency involved in its creation if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether But I do have to be concerned with those things It's my job I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there I've got to take that slide off I can't stand it Nor can Chris There Good So my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type The technology has changed a number of times since I started work: photo digital desktop screen web I've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what I do for design This slide is about the effect of tools on form The two letters the two K's the one on your left my right is modern made on a computer All

the straight lines are actually straight The curves are kind of subtle It has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture What a contrast Well I tell a lie A lie at TED I'm really sorry Both of these were made on a computer same software same Bézier curves same font format The one on your left was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre and I did the other one The tool is the same yet the letters are different The letters are different because the designers are different That's all Zuzana wanted hers to look like that I wanted mine to look like that End of story Type is very adaptable Unlike a fine art such as sculpture or architecture type hides its methods I think of myself as an industrial designer The thing I design is manufactured and it has a function: to be read to convey meaning But there is a bit more to it than that There's the sort of aesthetic element What makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers What gives the work of some designers sort of characteristic personal style as you might find in the work of a fashion designer an automobile designer whatever There have been some cases I admit where I as a designer did feel the influence of technology This is from the mid-'60s the change from metal type to photo hot to cold This brought some benefits but also one particular drawback: a spacing system that only provided 18 discrete units for letters to be accommodated on I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this 18-unit box Quickly looking at the arithmetic I realized I could only actually make three of related design Here you see them In Helvetica Compressed Extra Compressed and Ultra Compressed this rigid 18-unit system really boxed me in It kind of determined the proportions of the design Here are the typefaces at least the lower cases So do you look at these and say Poor Matthew he had to submit to a problem and by God it shows in the results I hope not If I were doing this same job today instead of having 18 spacing units I would have 1，000 Clearly I could make more variants but would these three members of the family be better It's hard to say without actually doing it but they would not be better in the proportion of 1，000 to 18 I can tell you that My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit and as I said type is very adaptable It does hide its methods All industrial designers work within constraints This is not fine art The question is does a constraint force a compromise By accepting a constraint are you working to a lower standard I don't believe so and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said He said he was conscious of working within constraints but not of making compromises The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle but it's very central to my attitude to work Remember this reading experience The phone book I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia This is from the mid-'70s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U。S phone books and it was my first experience of digital type and quite a baptism Designed for the phone books as I said to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high-speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack This is not a hospitable environment for a typographic designer So the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very adverse production conditions As I say we were in the infancy of digital type I had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper -- there were four weights of Bell Centennial pixel by pixel then encode them raster line by raster line for the keyboard It took two years but I learned a lot These letters look as though they've been chewed by the dog or something or other but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting revising the font accordingly These strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process At the outset AT&amp;T had wanted to set the phone books in Helvetica but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said in the Helvetica movie if you've seen that the letters in Helvetica were designed to be as similar to one another as possible This is not the recipe for legibility at small size It looks very elegant up on a slide I had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial by sort of opening the shapes up as you can see in the bottom part of that slide So now we're on to the mid-'80s the early days of digital outline fonts vector technology There was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts the amount of data that was required to find and store a font in computer memory It limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time I did an analysis of the data and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle because of all the points required to define the elegantly curved serif brackets The numbers at the bottom of the slide by the way they represent the amount of data needed to store each of the fonts So the sans serif in the middle sans the serifs was much more economical 81 to 151 Aha I thought The engineers have a problem Designer to the rescue I made a serif type you can see it on the right without curved serifs I made them polygonal out of straight line segments chamfered brackets And look as economical in data as a sans serif We call it Charter on the right So I went to the head of engineering with my numbers and I said proudly I have solved your problem Oh he said What problem And I said Well you know the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on Oh he said We solved that problem last week We wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude You can have as many fonts on your system as you like Well thank you for letting me know I said Foiled again I was left with a design solution for a nonexistent technical problem But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me I didn't just throw my design away in a fit of pique I persevered What had started as a technical exercise became an aesthetic exercise really In other words I had come to like this typeface Forget its origins Screw that I liked the design for its own sake The simplified forms of Charter gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality and unfussy spareness that sort of pleased me You know at times of technical innovation designers want to be influenced by what's in the air We want to respond We want to be pushed into exploring something new So Charter is a sort of parable for me really In the end there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter I had really misunderstood the technology The technology did suggest something to me but it did not force my hand and I think this happens very often You know engineers are very smart and despite occasional frustrations because I'm less smart I've always enjoyed working with them and learning from them Apropos in the mid-'90s I started talking to Microsoft about screen fonts Up to that point all the fonts on screen had been adapted from previously existing printing fonts of course But Microsoft foresaw correctly the movement the stampede towards electronic communication to reading and writing onscreen in importance So the priorities were just tipping at that point They wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen which were their coarse resolution displays I said to Microsoft a typeface designed for a particular technology is a self-obsoleting typeface I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems Thanks to the engineers the technical problems went away So did my typeface It was only a stopgap Microsoft came back to say that affordable computer monitors with better resolutions were at least a decade away So I thought well a decade that's not bad that's more than a stopgap So I was persuaded I was convinced and we went to work on what became Verdana and Georgia for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up At that time screens were binary The pixel was either on or it was off Here you see the outline of a letter the cap H which is the thin black line the contour which is how it is stored in memory superimposed on the bitmap which is the grey area which is how it's displayed on the screen The bitmap is rasterized from the outline Here in a cap H which is all straight lines the two are in almost perfect sync on the Cartesian grid Not so with an O This looks more like bricklaying than type design but believe me this is a good bitmap O for the simple reason that it's symmetrical in both x and y axes In a binary bitmap you actually can't ask for more than that I would sometimes make I don't know three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase A and then stand back to choose which was the best Well there was no best so the designer's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad Is that a compromise Not to me if you are working at the highest standard the technology will allow although that standard may be well short of the ideal You may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there The a in the upper one I think is better than the a in the lower one but it still ain't great You can maybe see the effect better if it's reduced Well maybe not So I'm a pragmatist not an idealist out of necessity For a certain kind of temperament there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic The bitmap looks jagged and rough It is jagged and rough But I discovered by experiment that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries Look in this example how rough as it is how the left and right legs actually break at the same level That's a victory That's good right there And of course at the lower depths you don't get much choice This is an S in case you were wondering Well it's been 18 years now since Verdana and Georgia were released Microsoft were absolutely right it took a good 10 years but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti-aliasing and so on So now that their mission is accomplished has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that I designed for coarser displays back then Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market Or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche that is independent of technology In other words have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream I'm not sure but they've had a good run so far Hey 18 is a good age for anything with present-day rates of attrition so I'm not complaining Thank you The universe is teeming with planets I want us in the next decade to build a space telescope that'll be able to image an Earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Princeton and I are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years Astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an Earth-like planet that might be able to harbor life but we haven't seen any of them We've only detected them indirectly This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990 when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the Earth from six billion kilometers away I want to take that of an Earth-like planet about another star Why haven't we done that Why is that hard Well to see let's imagine we take the Hubble Space Telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of Mars We'll see something like that a slightly blurry picture of the Earth because we're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of Mars Now let's move ten times further away Here we are at the orbit of Uranus It's gotten smaller it's got less detail less resolve We can still see the little moon but let's go ten times further away again Here we are at the edge of the solar system out at the Kuiper Belt Now it's not resolved at all It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's But let's move yet again ten times further away Here we are out at the Oort Cloud outside the solar system and we're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is One more time ten times further away Now we're at Alpha Centauri our nearest neighbor star and the planet is gone All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet which should be in that little red circle That's what we want to see That's why it's hard The light from the star is diffracting It's scattering inside the telescope creating that very bright image that washes out the planet So to see the planet we have to do something about all of that light We have to get rid of it I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer the father of the space telescope in 1962 and he took his inspiration from an eclipse You've all seen that That's a solar eclipse The moon has moved in front of the sun It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye I can see you in the back row Well what's going on Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow we look back at the sun and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim fine structure in the corona Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space We build a big screen we fly it in space we put it up in front of the star we block out most of the light we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created and boom we get to see planets Well that would look something like this So there's that big screen and there's no planets because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope It's like water bending around a rock in a stream and all that light just destroys the shadow It's a terrible shadow And we can't see planets But Spitzer actually knew the answer If we can feather the edges soften those edges so we can control diffraction well then we can see a planet and in the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that It looks something like that We call that our flower petal starshade If we make the edges of those petals exactly right if we control their shape we can control diffraction and now we have a great shadow It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before and we can see the planets beam out just like that That of course has to be bigger than my thumb That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50，000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow and then we can see those planets This sounds formidable but brilliant engineers colleagues of mine at JPL came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this It starts wrapped around a hub It separates from the telescope The petals unfurl they open up the telescope turns around Then you'll see it flip and fly out that 50，000 kilometers away from the telescope It's going to move in front of the star just like that creates a wonderful shadow Boom we get planets orbiting about it Thank you That's not science fiction We've been working on this for the last five or six years Last summer we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman So those are four petals This is a sub-scale star shade It's about half the size of the one you just saw You'll see the petals unfurl Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL Now you're seeing it deploy Those petals have to rotate into place The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter We ran this test 16 times and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter This has to be done very precisely but if we can do this if we can build this technology if we can get it into space you might see something like this That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope If we can take a similar space telescope slightly larger put it out there fly an occulter in front of it what we might see is something like that -- that's a family portrait of our solar system -- but not ours We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter through a starshade like that You can see Jupiter you can see Saturn Uranus Neptune and right there in the center next to the residual light is that pale blue dot That's Earth We want to see that see if there's water oxygen ozone the things that might tell us that it could harbor life I think this is the coolest possible science That's why I got into doing this because I think that will change the world That will change everything when we see that Thank you I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you or if you were delivering about the person you were delivering And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud It was the first two were It's a 。。 Well it shows you that I also deal with issues where there's not certainty of whether it's a girl or a boy so the mixed answer was very appropriate Of course now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised like we all were But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word because the third word is a description of your sex and by that I mean made by a description of your genitals Now as a pediatric endocrinologist I used to be very very involved and still somewhat am in cases in which there are mismatches or between the externals and the internals and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex at the time of birth that would define you and when I talk about definition I'm talking about your sexual orientation We don't say It's a gay boy A lesbian girl Those situations don't really define themselves more until the second decade of life Nor do they define your gender which as different from your anatomic sex describes your self-concept Do you see yourself as a male or female or somewhere in the spectrum in between That sometimes shows up but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross-gender play and way and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins But at the time that puberty begins that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls 12 to 14 in boys with breast budding in the case of genetic males by that particular point the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things Now this is relatively rare so I had relatively little personal experience with this and my experience was more typical only because I had an adolescent practice And I saw someone age 24 went through Harvard genetically female went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name and came to me after graduating saying Help me I know you know a lot of endocrinology And indeed I've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads This wasn't rocket science But I made a deal with him: I'll treat you if you teach me And so he did And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group And then I got really confused because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming but then my patient married and he married a woman who had been born as a male had married as a male had two children then went through a transition into female and now this delightful female was attached to my male patient in fact got legally married because they showed up Right And while I was confused about does this make so-and-so gay Does this make so-and-so straight I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity And my patient said to me Look look look If you just think of the following you'll get it right: Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with; gender identity is who you go to bed as And I subsequently learned from the many adults -- I took care of about 200 adults I learned from them that if I didn't look peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room I would never be able to guess better than chance whether they were gay straight bi or asexual in their affirmed gender In other words with the other And the data show it Now as I took care of the 200 adults I found it extremely painful These people were -- many of them had to give up so much of their lives Sometimes their parents would reject them siblings their own children and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children It was so awful but why did they do it at 40 and 50 Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves And indeed the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world So what to do I was intrigued in going to a conference in Holland where they are experts in this and saw the most remarkable thing They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn't want Because basically kids look about the same each sex until they go through puberty at which point if you feel you're in the wrong sex you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get And they fall apart So that's why putting the puberty on hold— Why on hold You can't just give them the opposite hormones that young They'll end up stunted in growth and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a 10-year-old girl a 12-year-old boy So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out they can have more and more testing they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them And then in a program they call 12-16-18 around age 12 is when they give the blocking hormones and then at age 16 with retesting they requalify Now remember the blocking hormones are reversible but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice depending on what you're using and those effects are permanent or require surgery to remove or electrolysis and you can never really affect the voice So this is serious and this is 15- 16-year-old stuff And then at 18 they're eligible for surgery and while there's no good surgery for females to males genitally the male-to-female surgery has fooled gynecologists That's how good it can be So I looked at how the patients were doing and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else except they were pubertally delayed But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm they look beautiful They look normal They had normal heights You would never be able to pick them out in a crowd So at that point I decided I'm going to do this This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in because in fact if you're going to deal with it in kids age 10-12 10-14 that's pediatric endocrinology So I brought some kids in and this now became the standard of care and Children's Hospital was behind it By my showing them the kids before and after people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated and pictures of the Dutch they came to me and said You've got to do something for these kids Well where were these kids before They were out there suffering is where they were So we started a program in 2007 It became the first program of its kind -- but it's really of the Dutch kind -- in North America And since then we have 160 patients Did they come from Afghanistan No They came 75 percent of them came from within 150 miles of Boston And some came from England She's 12 years old there she was living as a girl but she was being beaten up It was a horror show They had to homeschool her And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16 which means they were consigning them to an adult body no matter what happened even if they tested them well Jackie on top of it was by virtue of skeletal markings destined to be six feet five a male puberty Well I did something a little bit innovative because I do know hormones and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses the growth plates and stopping growth than testosterone is So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone but we added estrogen not at 16 but at 13 And so here she is at 16 on the left And on her 16th birthday she went to Thailand where they would do a genital plastic surgery They will do it at 18 now And she ended up 5'11 but more than that she has normal breast size because by blocking testosterone every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age not too late And on the far right there she is She went public semifinalist in the Miss England competition The judges debated as to can they do this Can they make her And one of them quipped I'm told But she has more natural self than half the other contestants And some of them have been rearranged a little bit but it's all her DNA And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman And she was offered contracts as a model at which point she teased me where she said You know I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one Go figure So this picture I think says it all It really says it all These are Nicole and brother Jonas identical twin boys and proven to be identical in which Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three At age seven they changed her name and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14 that male puberty is early in this family because he looks more like a 16-year-old but it makes the point all the more why you have to be conscious of where the patient is Nicole has done pubertal blockade in here and Jonas is just going -- biologic control This is what Nicole would look like if we weren't doing what we were doing He's got a prominent Adam's apple He's got angular bones to the face a mustache and you can see there's a height difference because he's gone through a growth spurt that she won't get Now Nicole is on estrogen She has a bit of a form to her This family went to the White House last spring because of their work in overturning an anti-discrimination there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms and it looked like the bill was going to pass and that would have been a problem but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said I can do this If they see me they'll understand why I'm no threat in the lady's room but I can be threatened in the men's room And then they finally got it So where do we go from here Well we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination There are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law against discrimination in housing employment public accommodation only 17 states and five of them are in New England We need less expensive drugs They cost a fortune And we need to get this condition out of the DSM It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian and that went out the window in 1973 and the whole world changed And this isn't going to break anybody's budget This is not that common But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society Thank you When I was born there was really only one book about how to raise your children and it was written by Dr Spock Thank you for indulging me I have always wanted to do that No it was Benjamin Spock and his book was called The Common Sense Book of Baby And Child Care It sold almost 50 million copies by the time he died Today I as the mother of a six-year-old walk into Barnes and Noble and see this And it is amazing the variety that one finds on those shelves There are guides to raising an eco-friendly kid which if you ask me is a little bit creepy There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science-minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb there is pretty much a guide to everything All of these books are well-intentioned I am sure that many of them are great But taken together I am sorry I do not see help when I look at that shelf I see anxiety I see a giant candy-colored monument to our collective panic and it makes me want to know why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia long before parenting message boards and peer-reviewed studies came along Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis Crisis might seem like a strong word but there is data suggesting it probably isn't There was in fact a paper of just this very name Parenthood as Crisis published in 1957 and in the 50-plus years since there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish Parents experience more stress than non-parents Their marital satisfaction is lower There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids and the answer often is not so great Last year I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness and here is what he told me he found: Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse which is better than interacting with other relatives which is better than interacting with acquaintances which is better than interacting with parents which is better than interacting with children Who are on par with strangers But here's the thing for three years and children are not the problem Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem Specifically I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be Parent as a verb only entered common usage in 1970 Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed The roles of our children have changed We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script and if you're an amazing jazz musician then improv is great but for the rest of us it can kind of feel like a crisis So how did we get here How is it that we are all now navigating a child-rearing universe without any norms to guide us Well for starters there has been a major historical change Until fairly recently kids worked on our farms primarily but also in factories mills mines Kids were considered economic assets Sometime during the Progressive Era we put an end to this arrangement We recognized kids had rights we banned child labor we focused on education instead and school became a child's new work And thank God it did But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical but it was reciprocal We provided food clothing shelter and moral instruction to our kids and they in return provided income Once kids stopped working the economics of parenting changed Kids became in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist economically worthless but emotionally priceless Rather than them working for us we began to work for them because within only a matter of decades it became clear: if we wanted our kids to succeed school was not enough Today extracurricular activities are a kid's new work but that's work for us too because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work but that's also work for us because we have to check it About three years ago a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart She said almost casually Homework is the new dinner The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in 1965 when most women were not even in the workforce It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding We have no clue what portion our wisdom if any is of use to our kids The world is changing so rapidly it's impossible to say This was true even when I was young When I was a kid high school specifically I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese And with all due respect to the Japanese it didn't turn out that way Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin and maybe they're onto something but we cannot know for sure So absent being able to anticipate the future what we all do as good parents is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off We teach our kids chess thinking maybe they will need analytical skills We sign them up for team sports thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills you know for when they go to Harvard Business School We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science-minded and eco-friendly and gluten-free though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef And you know what I'm doing okay I pay my taxes I hold down a steady job I was even invited to speak at TED But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me or for my folks for that matter isn't good enough anymore So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf because we feel like if we aren't trying everything it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers Now add to this problem something else: we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce This is another reason I think that parenthood feels like a crisis We have no rules no scripts no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners The writer Michael Lewis once put this very very well He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this: So did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world couples fight and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes Mothers are much more likely to be multi-tasking when they are at home and fathers when they are at home are much more likely to be mono-tasking Find a guy at home and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time In fact UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle-class homes Guess what it was Dad in a room by himself According to the American Time Use Survey which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant: I have not been alone in the bathroom since October But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them They work more paid hours on average than their wives and they genuinely want to be good involved dads Today it is fathers not mothers who report the most work-life conflict Either way by the way if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles just imagine what it's like now for non-traditional families: families with two dads families with two moms single-parent households They are truly improvising as they go Now in a more progressive country and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché and invoking yes Sweden parents could rely on the state for support There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers Unfortunately the United States is not one of them so in case you were wondering what the U。S has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia it's this: We too have no paid maternity leave policy We are one of eight known countries that does not In this age of intense confusion there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms helicopters or drones our kids' happiness is paramount That is what it means to raise kids in an age but emotionally priceless We are all the custodians of their self-esteem The one mantra no parent ever questions is All I want is for my children to be happy And don't get me wrong: I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child But it is a very elusive one Happiness and self-confidence teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike There's no curriculum for it Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things but they cannot really be goals unto themselves A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid And I have to tell you I think it leads to some very strange excesses We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from Sesame Street I wish I could say I was kidding about this but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of Sesame Street on DVD as I did out of nostalgia you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children Can I just repeat that The content of the original Sesame Street is not suitable for children When asked about this by The New York Times a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it Bad modeling I don't know But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know because he was too depressive I cannot tell you how much this distresses me You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall The offending muppet right there That's my son the day he was born I was high as a kite on morphine I had had an unexpected C-section But even in my opiate haze I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him I whispered it into his ear I said I will try so hard not to hurt you It was the Hippocratic Oath and I didn't even know I was saying it But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness In fact as any parent will tell you it's awfully hard All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids we may be assuming the wrong moral burden It strikes me as a better goal and dare I say a more virtuous one to focus on making productive kids and moral kids and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us That anyway is one response to having no script Absent having new scripts we just follow the oldest ones in the book -- decency a work ethic love and let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves I think if we all did that the kids would still be all right and so would their parents possibly in both cases even better Thank you So I've been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé which are the skills you bring to the marketplace The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy which are deeper: who are you in your depth what is the nature of your relationships are you bold loving dependable consistency And most of us including me would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues But at least in my case are they the ones that I think about the most And the answer is no So I've been thinking about that problem and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik who was a rabbi who wrote a book called The Lonely Man Of Faith in 1965 Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures which he called Adam I and Adam II Adam I is the worldly ambitious external side of our nature He wants to build create create companies create innovation Adam II is the humble side of our nature Adam II wants not only to do good but to be good to live in a way internally that honors God creation and our possibilities Adam I wants to conquer the world Adam II wants to hear a calling and obey the world Adam I savors accomplishment Adam II savors inner consistency and strength Adam I asks how things work Adam II asks why we're here Adam I's motto is success Adam II's motto is love redemption and return And Soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other We live in perpetual self-confrontation between the external success and the internal value And the tricky thing I'd say about these two sides of our nature is they work by different logics The external logic is an economic logic: input leads to output risk leads to reward The internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic You have to give to receive You have to surrender to something outside yourself to gain strength within yourself You have to conquer the desire to get what you want In order to fulfill yourself you have to forget yourself In order to find yourself you have to lose yourself We happen to live in a society that favors Adam I and often neglects Adam II And the problem is that turns you into a shrewd animal who treats life as a game and you become a cold calculating creature who slips into a sort of mediocrity where you realize there's a difference between your desired self and your actual self You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want you hope someone will give to you You don't have the depth of conviction You don't have an emotional sonorousness You don't have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit I was reminded of a common response through history of how you build a solid Adam II how you build a depth of character Through history people have gone back into their own pasts sometimes to a precious time in their life to their childhood and often the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame some sin committed some act of selfishness an act of omission of shallowness the sin of anger the sin of self-pity trying to be a people-pleaser a lack of courage Adam I is built by building on your strengths Adam II is built by fighting your weaknesses You go into yourself you find the sin which you've committed over and again through your life your signature sin out of which the others emerge and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin and out of that wrestling that suffering then a depth of character is constructed And we're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves in that we're not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it how to confront it and how to combat it We live in a culture with an Adam I mentality where we're inarticulate about Adam II Finally Reinhold Niebuhr summed up the confrontation the fully lived Adam I and Adam II life this way: Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith Nothing we do however virtuous can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint Therefore we must be saved by that final form of love which is forgiveness Thanks Pat Mitchell: That day January 8 2011 began like all others You were both doing the work that you love You were meeting with constituents which is something that you loved doing as a congresswoman and Mark you were happily preparing for your next space shuttle And suddenly everything that you had planned or expected in your lives was irrevocably changed forever Mark Kelly: Yeah it's amazing it's amazing how everything can change for any of us in an instant People don't realize that I certainly didn't Gabby Giffords: Yes And on that Saturday morning I got this horrible phone call from Gabby's chief of staff She didn't have much other information She just said Gabby was shot A few minutes later I called her back and I actually thought for a second well maybe I just imagined getting this phone call I called her back and that's when she told me that Gabby had been shot in the head And from that point on I knew that our lives were going to be a lot different PM: And when you arrived at the hospital what was the prognosis that they gave you about Gabby's condition and what recovery if any you could expect Well for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury they typically can't tell you much Every injury is different It's not predictable like often a stroke might be predictable which is another TBI kind of injury So they didn't know how long Gabby would be in a coma didn't know when that would change and what the prognosis would be PM: Gabby has your recovery been an effort to create a new Gabby Giffords or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords GG: The new one -- better stronger tougher That to say when you look at the picture behind us to come back from that kind of injury and come back strong and stronger than ever is a really tough thing to do I don't know anybody that's as tough as my wonderful wife right here PM: And what were the first signs that recovery was not only going to be possible but you were going to have some semblance of the life that you and Gabby had planned Well the first thing for me was Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious but she did something when she was in the ICU hospital bed that she used to do when we might be out to dinner at a restaurant in that she pulled my ring off and she flipped it from one finger to the next and at that point I knew that she was still in there PM: And there were certain words too Didn't she surprise you with words in the beginning Well it was tough in the beginning GG: What What Chicken Chicken Chicken Yeah that was it For the first month that was the extent of Gabby's vocabulary For some reason she has aphasia which is difficulty with communication She latched on to the word chicken which isn't the best but certainly is not the worst And we were actually worried it could have been a lot worse than that PM: Gabby what's been the toughest challenge for you during this recovery GG: Talking Really hard Really Yeah with aphasia Gabby knows what she wants to say she just can't get it out She understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head which is where the bullet passed through PM: So you have to do a very dangerous thing: speak for your wife I do It might be some of the most dangerous things I've ever done PM: Gabby are you optimistic about your continuing recovery -- walking talking being able to move your arm and leg GG: I'm optimistic It will be a long hard haul but I'm optimistic PM: That seems to be the number one characteristic of Gabby Giffords wouldn't you say Gabby's always been really optimistic She works incredibly hard every day GG: On the treadmill walked on my treadmill Spanish lessons French horn It's only my wife who could be -- and if you knew her before she was injured you would kind of understand this -- somebody who could be injured and have such a hard time communicating and meets with a speech therapist and then about a month ago she says I want to learn Spanish again PM: Well let's take a little closer look at the wife and this was even before you met Gabby Giffords And she's on a motor scooter there but it's my understanding that's a very tame image of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up Yeah Gabby she used to race motorcycles So that's a scooter but she had -- well she still has a BMW motorcycle PM: Does she ride it Well that's a challenge with not being able to move her right arm but I think with something I know about Velcro we might be able to get her back on the bike Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar PM: I have a feeling we might see that picture next Gabby But you meet you're already decided that you're going to dedicate your life to service You're going into the military and eventually to become an astronaut So you meet What attracts you to Gabby Well when we met oddly enough it was the last time we were in Vancouver about 10 years ago We met in Vancouver at the airport on a trip that we were both taking to China that I would actually from my background I would call it a boondoggle Gabby would GG: Fact-finding mission She would call it an important fact-finding mission She was a state senator at the time and we met here at the airport before a trip to China PM: Would you describe it as a whirlwind romance GG: No no no A good friend Yeah we were friends for a long time GG: Yes And then she invited me on about a year or so later she invited me on a date Where'd we go Gabby GG: Death row Yes Our first date was to death row at the Florence state prison in Arizona which was just outside Gabby's state senate district They were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of Arizona So she couldn't get anybody else to go with her and I'm like Of course I want to go to death row So that was our first date We've been together ever since GG: Yes PM: Well that might have contributed to the reason that Gabby decided to marry you You were willing to go to death row after all I guess PM: Gabby what did make you want to marry Mark GG: Um good friends Best friends Best friends I thought we always had a very special relationship We've gone through some tough times and it's only made it stronger GG: Stronger PM: After you got married however you continued very independent lives Actually you didn't even live together We had one of those commuter marriages In our case it was Washington D。C。 Houston Tucson Sometimes we'd go clockwise sometimes counterclockwise to all those different places and we didn't really live together until that Saturday morning Within an hour of Gabby being shot I was on an airplane to Tucson and that was the moment where that had changed things PM: And also Gabby you had run for Congress after being a state senator and served in Congress for six years What did you like best about being in Congress GG: Fast pace Fast pace PM: Well it was the way you did it GG: Yes yes Fast pace PM: I'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way Yeah you know legislation is often at a colossally slow pace but my wife and I have to admit a lot of other members of Congress that I know work incredibly hard I mean Gabby would run around like a crazy person never take a day off maybe a half a day off a month and whenever she was awake she was working and she really really thrived on that and still does today GG: Yes Yes PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house I have to say So after the tragic incident Mark you decided to resign your position as an astronaut even though you were supposed to take the next space mission Everybody including Gabby talked you into going back and you did end up taking Kind of The day after Gabby was injured I called my boss the chief astronaut Dr Peggy Whitson and I said Peggy I know I'm launching in space in three months from now Gabby's in a coma I'm in Tucson You've got to find a replacement for me So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut but I gave up my job and they found a replacement Months later maybe about two months later I started about getting my job back which is something when you become this primary caregiver person which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position it's a challenging role but at some point you've got to figure out when you're going to get your life back and at the time I couldn't ask Gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again But I knew she was— GG: Yes Yes Yes She was the biggest supporter of my career and I knew it was the right thing to do PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine Mark what that was like going off onto a mission one presumes safely but it's never a guarantee and knowing that Gabby is Well not only was she still in the hospital on the third day of that flight literally while I was rendezvousing with the space station and you've got two vehicles moving at 17，500 miles an hour I'm actually flying it looking out the window a bunch of computers Gabby was in brain surgery literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic yeah which is the whole side of her head Now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in Tucson for the first time Gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of Tupperware that has the real skull GG: The real skull Which freaks people out sometimes PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert Mark Well it just gets the conversation going PM: But there was a lot of conversation about something you did Gabby after Mark's flight You had to make another step of courage too because here was Congress deadlocked again and you got out of the rehabilitation center got yourself to Washington so that you could walk on the floor of the House -- I can barely talk about this without getting emotional and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote GG: The debt ceiling The debt ceiling Yeah we had that vote I guess about five months after Gabby was injured and she made this bold decision to go back A very controversial vote but she wanted to be there to have her voice heard one more time PM: And after that resigned and began what has been a very slow and challenging recovery What's life like day to day Well that's Gabby's service dog Nelson GG: Nelson New member of our family GG: Yes yes And we got him from a— GG: Prison Murder We have a lot of connections with prisons apparently Nelson came from a prison raised by a murderer in Massachusetts But she did a great job with this dog He's a fabulous service dog PM: So Gabby what have you learned from your experiences the past few years Yeah what have you learned GG: Deeper Deeper PM: Your relationship is deeper It has to be You're together all the time now I imagine being grateful too right GG: Grateful PM: This is a picture of family and friends gathering but I love these pictures because they show the Gabby and Mark relationship now And you describe it Gabby over and over as deeper on so many levels Yes I think when something tragic happens in a family it can pull people together Here's us watching the space shuttle fly over Tucson the Space Shuttle Endeavour the one that I was the commander on its last flight on its final flight on top of an airplane on a 747 on its way to L。A。 NASA was kind enough to have it fly over Tucson PM: And of course the two of you go through these challenges of a slow and difficult recovery and yet Gabby how do you maintain your optimism and positive outlook GG: I want to make the world a better place PM: And you're doing that even though your recovery has to remain front and center for both of you You are people who have done service to your country and you are continuing to do that with a new initiative a new purpose And Gabby what's on the agenda now GG: Americans for Responsible Solutions That's our political action committee where we are trying to get members of Congress to take a more serious look at gun violence in this country and to try to pass some reasonable legislation GG: Yes Yes You know this affected us very personally but it wasn't what happened to Gabby that got us involved It was really the 20 murdered first graders and kindergartners in Newtown Connecticut and the response that we saw afterwards where -- well look what's happened so far So far the national response has been pretty much to do nothing We're trying to change that PM: There have been 11 mass shootings since Newtown a school a week in the first two months of last year What are you doing that's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities We're gun owners we support gun rights At the same time we've got to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill It's not too difficult to do that This issue like many others has become very polarizing and political and we're trying to bring some balance to the debate in Washington PM: Thank you both for that effort And not surprisingly for this woman of courage and of a sense of adventure you just keep challenging yourself and the sky seems to be the limit I have to share this video of your most recent adventure Take a look at Gabby This is a couple months ago You okay You did great GG: Yes it's gorgeous Thank you Good stuff Gorgeous Oh thank you Mountains Gorgeous mountains Let me just say one of the guys that Gabby jumped with that day was a Navy SEAL who she met in Afghanistan who was injured in combat had a really rough time Gabby visited him when he was at Bethesda and went through a really tough period He started doing better Months later Gabby was shot in the head and then he supported her while she was in the hospital in Houston So they have a very very nice connection GG: Yes PM: What a wonderful moment Because this is the TED stage Gabby I know you worked very hard to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave with this audience GG: Thank you Hello everyone Thank you for inviting us here today It's been a long hard haul but I'm getting better I'm working hard lots of therapy -- speech therapy physical therapy and yoga too But my spirit is strong as ever I'm still fighting to make the world a better place and you can too Get involved with your community Be a leader Set an example Be passionate Be courageous Be your best Thank you very much Thank you GG: Thank you Thank you everybody GG: Bye bye I was born and raised in Sierra Leone a small and very beautiful country in West Africa a country rich both in physical resources and creative talent However Sierra Leone is infamous for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s when entire villages were burnt down An estimated 8，000 men women and children had their arms and legs amputated during this time As my family and I ran for safety when I was about 12 from one of those attacks I resolved that I would do everything I could to ensure that my own children would not go through the same experiences we had They would in fact be part of a Sierra Leone where war and amputation were no longer a strategy for gaining power As I watched people who I knew loved ones recover from this devastation one thing that deeply troubled me was that many of the amputees in the country would not use their prostheses The reason I would come to find out was that their prosthetic sockets were painful because they did not fit well The prosthetic socket is the part in which the amputee inserts their residual limb and which connects to the prosthetic ankle Even in the developed world it takes a period of three weeks to often years for a patient to get a comfortable socket if ever Prosthetists still use conventional processes like molding and casting to create single-material prosthetic sockets Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts of pressure on the limbs of the patient leaving them with pressure sores and blisters It does not matter how powerful your prosthetic ankle is If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable you will not use your leg and that is just simply unacceptable in our age So one day when I met professor Hugh Herr about two and a half years ago and he asked me if I knew how to solve this problem I said No not yet but I would love to figure it out And so for my Ph。D at the MIT Media Lab I designed custom prosthetic sockets quickly and cheaply that are more comfortable than conventional prostheses I used magnetic resonance imaging to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy then use finite element modeling to better predict the internal stresses and strains on the normal forces and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture We use a 3D printer to create a multi-material prosthetic socket which relieves pressure where needed on the anatomy of the patient In short we're using data to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply In a recent trial we just wrapped up at the Media Lab one of our patients a U。S veteran who has been an amputee for about 20 years and worn dozens of legs said of one of our printed parts It's so soft it's like walking on pillows and it's effing sexy Disability in our age should not prevent anyone from living meaningful lives My hope and desire is that the tools and processes we develop in our research group can be used to bring highly functional prostheses to those who need them For me a place to begin healing the souls of those affected by war and disease is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces for their bodies Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston I hope this not only restores but indeed transforms their sense of human potential Thank you very much What is the intersection between technology art and science Curiosity and wonder because it drives us to explore because we're surrounded by things we can't see And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space to make the invisible visible because what that does it expands our horizons it transforms our perception and it touches our heart So here are some scenes from my 3D IMAX film Mysteries of the Unseen World There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life We can see how organisms emerge and grow how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight And at the grand scale time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion We can view not only the vast sweep of nature but the restless movement of humanity Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane and by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible: the vast network of air travel over the United States We can do the same thing with ships at sea We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere pulsing with lightning crowned by the aurora borealis It may be the ultimate time-lapse image: the anatomy of Earth brought to life At the other extreme but we have technology that can look into that world as well With high-speed cameras we can do the opposite of time lapse We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work and perhaps we can even imitate them When a dragonfly flutters by you may not realize but it's the greatest flier in nature It can hover fly backwards even upside down And by tracking markers on an insect's wings we can visualize the air flow that they produce Nobody knew the secret can move all four wings in different directions at the same time And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places We're giants and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times This is the egg of a butterfly And there are unseen creatures living all over your body including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes crawling over your skin at night Can you guess what this is Shark skin A caterpillar's mouth The eye of a fruit fly An eggshell A flea A snail's tongue We think we know most of the animal kingdom but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered A spider also has great secrets because spider's silk thread is pound for pound but completely elastic This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair On there is bacteria and near that bacteria 10 times smaller a virus Inside of that 10 times smaller three strands of DNA and nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes single carbon atoms With the tip of a powerful microscope we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day perhaps repair DNA We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life So under an endless rain of cosmic dust the air is full of pollen micro-diamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable Knowing that there's so much around us we can see forever changes our understanding of the world and by looking at unseen worlds we recognize that we exist in the living universe and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives We'll just have to see Thank you Right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a 60-page paper based on some age-old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life which is be an educator change lives and spark magic Right now there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement in the most disengaging way possible Right now there's a first-year teacher at home who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately while at the same time saying to herself over and over again Don't smile till November because that's what she was taught in her teacher education program Right now there's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he's very very sick and can't make it to school tomorrow On the other hand right now there are amazing educators that are sharing information information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge Right now there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before but if they close their eyes tightly enough they can envision that world because the storytelling is so compelling Right now there's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says Put them down Right now So people will then say Well Chris you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you're also describing these powerful educators If you're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular these guys will probably cancel each other out and then we'll be okay The reality is the folks I described as the master teachers the master narrative builders the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms The folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don't even know what teacher certification means They may not even have the degrees to be able to have anything to call an education And that to me is sad It's sad because the people who I described they were very disinterested in the learning process want to be effective teachers but they have no models I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain Mark Twain says that proper preparation or teaching is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good it can turn awful practices into powerful ones it can change men and transform them into angels The folks who I described earlier got proper preparation in teaching not in any college or university but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage Guess where those places are Barber shops rap concerts and most importantly in the black church And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy Who here has been to a black church We got a couple of hands You go to a black church their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes and then he takes a pause and he says Oh my gosh they're not quite paying attention So he says Can I get an amen Audience: Amen Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen Audience: Amen That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention He drops his voice at a very very low volume when he wants people to key into him and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers So why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills that magic that you need to engage an audience to engage a student So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education that we could focus on content and that's fine and we could focus on theories and that's fine but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing Now people oftentimes say Well magic is just magic There are teachers who despite all their challenges who have those skills get into those schools and are able to engage an audience and the administrator walks by and says Wow he's so good I wish all my teachers could be that good And when they try to describe what that is they just say He has that magic But I'm here to tell you that magic can be taught Magic can be taught Magic can be taught Now how do you teach it You teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education you've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop you've got to attend that black church and you've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do At our teacher education classes at my university I've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts They watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage They listen to his metaphors and analogies and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic They learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch you don't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more And if we could transform teacher education to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic then poof we could make dead classes come alive we could reignite imaginations and we can change education Thank you When people think about cities they tend to think of certain things They think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers noisy cabs But when I think about cities I think about people Cities are fundamentally about people and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work So even more important than buildings in a city are the public spaces in between them And today some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces So I believe that lively enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city They are what makes it come alive But what makes a public space work What attracts people to successful public spaces and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away I thought if I could answer those questions I could make a huge contribution to my city But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan This little space became a small phenomenon and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers it made an enormous impression on me I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it Well I would sit in the park and watch very carefully and first among other things were the comfortable movable chairs People would come in find their own seat move it a bit actually and then stay a while and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people and ironically I felt more peaceful if there were other people around And it was green This little park provided what New Yorkers crave: comfort and greenery But my question was why weren't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn't feel alone or like a trespasser Unfortunately that's not how cities were being designed So here you see a familiar sight This is how plazas have been designed for generations They have that stylish Spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture but it's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this They not only look desolate they feel downright dangerous I mean where would you sit here What would you do here But architects love them They are plinths for their creations They might tolerate a sculpture or two but that's about it And for developers they are ideal There's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about But don't you think this is a waste For me becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that I lived in and loved I wanted to be able to create places that would give you the feeling that you got in Paley Park and not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this But over the many years I have learned how hard it is to create successful meaningful enjoyable public spaces As I learned from my stepfather they certainly do not happen by accident especially in a city like New York where public space has to be fought for to begin with and then for them to be successful somebody has to think very hard about every detail Now open spaces in cities are opportunities Yes they are opportunities for commercial investment but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city and those two goals are often not aligned with one another and therein lies the conflict The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for 10 years and we were told unless we found a developer in six months it would go bankrupt So we came up with a radical almost insane idea Instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don't we reverse that equation and build a small but very high-quality public open space first and see if that made a difference So we only could afford to build a two-block section of what would become a mile-long esplanade so whatever we built had to be perfect So just to make sure I insisted that we build a mock-up in wood at scale of the railing and the sea wall And when I sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me the railing hit exactly at eye level blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water's edge So you see details really do make a difference But design is not just how something looks it's how your body feels on that seat in that space and I believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience In this photo everything looks very finished but that granite edge those lights the back on that bench the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be Now this proved very valuable 20 years later when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of New York And he said to me on that very day he said that New York was projected to grow from eight to nine million people And he asked me So where are you going to put one million additional New Yorkers Well I didn't have any idea Now you know that New York does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but honestly where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water How were we going to find housing for that many new New Yorkers And if we couldn't spread out which was probably a good thing where could new housing go And what about cars Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars So what were we going to do If we couldn't spread out we had to go up And if we had to go up we had to go up in places where you wouldn't need to own a car So that meant using one of our greatest assets: our transit system But we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it So here was the answer to our puzzle If we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit we could actually handle that population increase we thought And so here was the plan what we really needed to do: We needed to redo our zoning -- and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool -- and basically reshape the entire city targeting where new development could go and prohibiting any development at all in our car-oriented suburban-style neighborhoods Well this was an unbelievably ambitious idea ambitious because communities had to approve those plans So how was I going to get this done By listening So I began listening in fact thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust You know communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods It's not something you can just fake And so I began walking I can't tell you how many blocks I walked in sweltering summers in freezing winters year after year just so I could get to understand the DNA of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert finding ways that zoning could address communities' concerns So little by little neighborhood by neighborhood block by block we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit Over the course of 12 years we were able to rezone 124 neighborhoods 40 percent of the city 12，500 blocks so that now 90 percent of all new development of New York is within a 10-minute walk of a subway In other words nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car Well those rezonings were exhausting and enervating and important but rezoning was never my mission You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning My mission was always to create great public spaces So in the areas where we zoned for significant development I was determined to create places that would make a difference in people's lives Here you see what was two miles of abandoned degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn impossible to get to and impossible to use Now the zoning here was massive so I felt an obligation to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts and I spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans I wanted to make sure that there were tree-lined paths from the upland to the water that there were trees and plantings everywhere and of course lots and lots of places to sit Honestly I had no idea how it would turn out I had to have faith But I put everything that I had studied and learned into those plans And then it opened and I have to tell you it was incredible People came from all over the city to be in these parks I know they changed the lives of the people who live there but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image of their city I often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs and I can't tell you why but I'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there And here is a new park in lower Manhattan Now the water's edge in lower Manhattan was a complete mess before 9/11 Wall Street was essentially landlocked because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge And after 9/11 the city had very little control But I thought if we went to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan And it did Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides I really love this park You know railings have to be higher now so we put bar seating at the edge and you can get so close to the water you're practically on it And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop And I love when people come there and look up and they say Wow there's Brooklyn and it's so close So what's the trick How do you turn a park into a place that people want to be Well it's up to you not as a city planner but as a human being You don't tap into your design expertise You tap into your humanity I mean would you want to go there Would you want to stay there Can you see into it and out of it Are there other people there Does it seem green and friendly Can you find your very own seat Well now all over New York City there are places where you can find your very own seat Where there used to be parking spaces there are now pop-up cafes Where Broadway traffic used to run there are now tables and chairs Where 12 years ago sidewalk cafes were not allowed they are now everywhere But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple and it's even harder to keep them that way So now I'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the High Line The High Line was an elevated railway The High Line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on Manhattan's West Side and when the train stopped running it became a self-seeded landscape a kind of a garden in the sky And when I saw it the first time honestly when I went up on that old viaduct I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person honestly And when I was appointed saving the first two sections of the High Line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project I knew if there was a day that I didn't worry about the High Line it would come down And the High Line even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular it is the most contested public space in the city You might see a beautiful park but not everyone does You know it's true commercial interests will always battle against public space You might say How wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the High Line Well a developer sees just one thing: customers Hey why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the High Line Wouldn't that be terrific and won't it mean a lot more money for the city Well no it would not be terrific It would be a mall and not a park And you know what it might mean more money for the city but a city has to take the long view the view for the common good Most recently the last section of the High Line the third section of the High Line the final section of the High Line has been pitted against development interests where some of the city's leading developers are building more than 17 million square feet at the Hudson Yards And they came to me and proposed that they temporarily disassemble that third and final section Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill Perhaps it was just in their way But in any case it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition and that was only two years ago So you see no matter how popular and successful a public space may be it can never be taken for granted public spaces always need vigilant champions not only to claim them at the outset for public use but to design them for the people that use them then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone that they are not violated invaded abandoned or ignored If there is any one lesson that I have learned in my life as a city planner it is that public spaces have power It's not just the number of people using them it's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there Public space can change how you live in a city how you feel about a city whether you choose one city over another and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city I believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party People stay because they are having a great time Thank you Thank you So a chip a poet and a boy It's just about 20 years ago June 1994 when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions -- I don't know what that means but it's what it says on Wikipedia there was a flaw and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error and the probability was one out of every 360 billion calculations So Intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every 27，000 years They didn't think it was significant but there was an outrage in the community The community the techies said this flaw has to be addressed They were not going to stand by quietly as Intel gave them these chips So there was a revolution across the world People marched to demand -- okay not really exactly like that but they rose up and they demanded that Intel fix the flaw And Intel set aside 475 million dollars to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw So billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every 360 billion calculations Number two a poet This is Martin Niemöller You're familiar with his poetry Around the height of the Nazi period he started repeating the verse First they came for the communists and I did nothing did not speak out because I was not a communist Then they came for the socialists Then they came for the trade unions Then they came for the Jews And then they came for me But there was no one left to speak for me Now Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight This is an insight at the core of intelligence We could call it cluefulness It's a certain kind of test: Can you recognize an underlying threat and respond Can you save yourself or save your kind Turns out ants are pretty good at this Cows not so much So can you see the pattern Can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it Number two Number three a boy This is my friend Aaron Swartz He's Tim's friend He's friends of many of you in this audience and seven years ago Aaron came to me with a question It was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk I was so proud I was telling him about my talk Laws that choke creativity And Aaron looked at me and was a little impatient and he said So how are you ever going to solve the problems you're talking about Copyright policy Internet policy how are you ever going to address those problems so long as there's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works So I was a little put off by this He wasn't sharing in my celebration And I said to him You know Aaron it's not my field not my field He said You mean as an academic it's not your field I said Yeah as an academic it's not my field He said What about as a citizen As a citizen Now this is the way Aaron was He didn't tell He asked questions But his questions spoke as clearly as my four-year-old's hug He was saying to me You've got to get a clue You have got to get a clue because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times our democracy tries to make a decision It is every time every single important issue We've got to end the bovinity of this political society We've got to adopt it turns out the word is fourmi-formatic attitude -- that's what the Internet tells me the word is -- the ant's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw save our kind and save our demos Now if you know Aaron Swartz you know that we lost him just over a year ago It was about six weeks before I gave my TED Talk and I was so grateful to Chris that he asked me to give this TED Talk not because I had the chance to talk to you although that was great but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression I couldn't begin to describe the sadness Because I had to focus I had to focus on what was I going to say to you It saved me But after the buzz the excitement the power that comes from this community I began to yearn for a less sterile less academic way to address these issues the issues that I was talking about We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire as a target for this political movement because the primary in New Hampshire is so incredibly important It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion that was beginning to talk about how would we make this issue of this corruption central in 2016 But it was another soul that caught my imagination a woman named Doris Haddock aka Granny D On January 1 1999 15 years ago at the age of 88 Granny D started a walk She started in Los Angeles and began to walk to Washington D。C with a single sign on her chest that said campaign finance reform Eighteen months later at the age of 90 she arrived in Washington with hundreds following her including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her Now I don't have 13 months to walk across the country I've got three kids who hate to walk and a wife who it turns out still hates when I'm not there for mysterious reasons but the question I asked could we remix Granny D a bit What about a walk not of 3，200 miles but of 185 miles across New Hampshire in January So on January 11 we began a walk that ended on January 24th the day that Granny D was born A total of 200 people joined us across this walk talking about this issue And what was astonishing to me something I completely did not expect to find was the passion and anger that there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics Now politicians and pundits tell you there's nothing we can do about this issue Americans don't care about it but the reason for that is that 91 percent of Americans think there's nothing that can be done about this issue And it's this gap between 96 and 91 that explains our politics of resignation I mean after all at least 96 percent of us wish we could fly like Superman but because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't we don't leap off of tall buildings every time we have that urge That's because we accept our limits and so too with this reform But when you give people the sense of hope you begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility As Harvey Milk said if you give 'em hope you give 'em a chance a way to think about how this change is possible Hope And hope is the one thing that we Aaron's friends failed him with because we let him lose that sense of hope I loved that boy like I love my son But we failed him And I love my country and I'm not going to fail that I'm not going to fail that That sense of hope we're going to hold and we're going to fight for however impossible this battle looks What's next Well we started with this march with 200 people and next year there will be 1，000 on different routes that march in the month of January and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause and then in 2016 before the primary there will be 10，000 who march across that state meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause And as we have marched people around the country have begun to say Can we do the same thing in our state So we've started a platform called G。D Walkers that is Granny D walkers and Granny D walkers across the country will be marching for this reform Number one Number two on this march one of the founders of Thunderclap David Cascino was with us and he said Well what can we do And so they developed a platform which we are announcing today that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform Regardless of where you are in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire you can sign up and directly be informed where the candidates are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is going to make this possibility real And then finally number three the hardest Indeed yesterday Merriam announced So on May 1 aka May Day we're going to try an experiment We're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a Super PAC to end all Super PACs And the basic way this works is this For the last year we have been working with analysts and political experts to calculate how much would it cost to win enough votes in the United States Congress to make fundamental reform possible What is that number And then whatever that number is because you can't use KickStarter for political work but anyway kickstart sort of first a bottom-up campaign where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals and when those goals have been reached we will turn to the large dollar contributors to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary to win this issue to change the way money influences politics so that on November 8 which I discovered yesterday is the day that Aaron would have been 30 years old on November 8 we will celebrate 218 representatives in the House and 60 Senators in the United States Senate who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform So last night we heard about wishes Here's my wish May one May the ideals of one boy unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people we are the people who were promised a government a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone the people who as Madison told us meant not the rich more than the poor May one not because you're a politician not because you're an expert not because this is your field but because if you are you are a citizen Aaron asked me that Now I've asked you Thank you very much If you remember that first decade of the web it was really a static place You could go online you could look at pages and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech-savvy for the time And with the rise of social media and social networks in the early 2000s the web was completely changed to a place where now the vast majority of content we interact with is put up by average users either in YouTube videos or blog posts or product reviews or social media postings And it's also become a much more interactive place where people are interacting with others they're commenting they're sharing they're not just reading So Facebook is not the only place you can do this but it's the biggest and it serves to illustrate the numbers Facebook has 1。2 billion users per month So half the Earth's Internet population is using Facebook They are a site along with others that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online So the result is that we have behavioral preference demographic data for hundreds of millions of people which is unprecedented in history And as a computer scientist what this means is that I've been able to build models that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes for all of you that you don't even know you're sharing information about As scientists we use that to help the way people interact online but there's less altruistic applications and there's a problem in that users don't really understand these techniques and how they work and even if they did they don't have a lot of control over it So what I want to talk to you about today is some of these things that we're able to do and then give us some ideas of how we might go forward to move some control back into the hands of users So this is Target the company I didn't just put that logo on this poor pregnant woman's belly You may have seen this anecdote that was printed in Forbes magazine where Target sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl with advertisements and coupons for baby bottles and diapers and cribs two weeks before she told her parents that she was pregnant Yeah the dad was really upset He said How did Target figure out that this high school girl was pregnant before she told her parents It turns out that they have the purchase history for hundreds of thousands of customers and they compute what they call a pregnancy score which is not just whether or not a woman's pregnant but what her due date is And they compute that not by looking at the obvious things like she's buying a crib or baby clothes but things like she bought more vitamins than she normally had or she bought a handbag that's big enough to hold diapers And by themselves those purchases don't seem like they might reveal a lot but it's a pattern of behavior that when you take it in the context of thousands of other people starts to actually reveal some insights So that's the kind of thing that we do when we're predicting stuff about you on social media We're looking for little patterns of behavior that when you detect them among millions of people lets us find out all kinds of things So in my lab and with colleagues we've developed mechanisms where we can quite accurately predict things like your political preference your personality score gender sexual orientation religion age intelligence along with things like how much you trust the people you know and how strong those relationships are We can do all of this really well And again it doesn't come from what you might think of as obvious information So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies If you Google this you'll find it It's four pages easy to read And they looked at just people's Facebook likes so just the things you like on Facebook and used that to predict all these attributes along with some other ones that were most indicative of high intelligence And among those was liking a page for curly fries Curly fries are delicious but liking them does not necessarily mean that you're smarter than the average person So how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that's being predicted And it turns out that we have to look at a whole bunch of underlying theories to see why we're able to do this One of them is a sociological theory called homophily which basically says people are friends with people like them So if you're smart you tend to be friends with smart people and if you're young you tend to be friends with young people and this is well established for hundreds of years We also know a lot about how information spreads through networks It turns out things like viral videos or Facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way that diseases spread through social networks So this is something we've studied for a long time We have good models of it And so you can put those things together and start seeing why things like this happen So if I were to give you a hypothesis it would be that a smart guy started this page or maybe one of the first people who liked it would have scored high on that test And they liked it and their friends saw it and by homophily we know that he probably had smart friends and so it spread to them and some of them liked it and they had smart friends and so it spread to them and so it propagated through the network to a host of smart people so that by the end the action of liking the curly fries page is indicative of high intelligence not because of the content but because the actual action of liking reflects back the common attributes of other people who have done it So this is pretty complicated stuff right It's a hard thing to sit down and explain to an average user and even if you do what can the average user do about it How do you know that you've liked something that indicates a trait for you that's totally irrelevant to the content of what you've liked There's a lot of power that users don't have to control how this data is used And I see that as a real problem going forward So I think there's a couple paths that we want to look at if we want to give users some control over how this data is used because it's not always going to be used for their benefit An example I often give is that if I ever get bored being a professor I'm going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you're a drug user if you're an alcoholic We know how to predict all that And I'm going to sell reports to H。R companies and big businesses that want to hire you We totally can do that now I could start that business tomorrow and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that That seems to me to be a problem So one of the paths we can go down is the policy and law path And in some respects I think that that would be most effective but the problem is we'd actually have to do it Observing our political process in action makes me think it's highly unlikely that we're going to get a bunch of representatives to sit down learn about this and then enact sweeping changes to intellectual property law in the U。S so users control their data We could go the policy route where social media companies say you know what You own your data You have total control over how it's used The problem is that the revenue models for most social media companies rely on sharing or exploiting users' data in some way It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users aren't the customer they're the product And so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users It's possible but I don't think it's something that we're going to see change quickly So I think the other path that we can go down that's going to be more effective is one of more science It's doing science that allowed us to develop all these mechanisms for computing this personal data in the first place And it's actually very similar research that we'd have to do if we want to develop mechanisms that can say to a user Here's the risk of that action you just took By liking that Facebook page or by sharing this piece of personal information you've now improved my ability to predict whether or not you're using drugs or whether or not you get along well in the workplace And that I think can affect whether or not people want to share something keep it private or just keep it offline altogether We can also look at things like allowing people to encrypt data that they upload so it's kind of invisible and worthless to sites like Facebook or third party services that access it but that select users who the person who posted it want to see it have access to see it This is all super exciting research from an intellectual perspective and so scientists are going to be willing to do it So that gives us an advantage over the law side One of the problems that people bring up when I talk about this is they say you know if people start keeping all this data private all those methods that you've been developing to predict their traits are going to fail And I say absolutely and for me that's success because as a scientist my goal is not to infer information about users it's to improve the way people interact online And sometimes that involves inferring things about them but if users don't want me to use that data I think they should have the right to do that I want users to be informed and consenting users of the tools that we develop And so I think encouraging this kind of science and supporting researchers who want to cede some of that control back to users and away from the social media companies means that going forward as these tools evolve and advance means that we're going to have an educated and empowered user base and I think all of us can agree that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward Thank you So this is an interview with a difference On the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words what I did was I asked Bill and Melinda to dig out from their archive some of what they've done and do a few things that way So we're going to start here Melinda when and where was this and who is that handsome man next to you Melinda Gates: With those big glasses huh This is in Africa our very first trip the first time either of us had ever been to Africa in the fall of 1993 We were already engaged to be married We married a few months later and this was the trip where we really went to see the animals and to see the savanna It was incredible Bill had never taken that much time But what really touched us actually were the people and the extreme poverty Does it have to be like this And at the end of the trip we went out to Zanzibar and took some time to walk on the beach while we were dating that the wealth that had come from Microsoft would be given back to society that we started to talk about well what might we do and how might we go about it So given that this vacation the world's biggest private foundation it's pretty expensive as vacations go MG: I guess so We enjoyed it Which of you was the key instigator here or was it symmetrical Bill Gates: Well I think we were excited that there'd be a phase of our life and figure out how to give this money back At this stage we were talking about the poorest and could you have a big impact on them Were there things that weren't being done There was a lot we didn't know Our naïveté is pretty incredible when we look back on it But we had a certain enthusiasm MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet so some things change along the way So it started there but it got accelerated So that was '93 and it was '97 really before the foundation itself started Yeah in '97 we read an article about diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world and we kept saying to ourselves Well that can't be In the U。S。 you just go down to the drug store And so we started gathering scientists and started learning about population learning about what had worked and what had failed and that's really when we got going was in late 1998 1999 So you've got a big pot of money and a world full of so many different issues How on Earth do you decide what to focus on Well we decided that we'd pick two causes whatever the biggest inequity was globally and countries that were really stuck because with that level of death and parents would have so many kids that they'd get huge population growth and that the kids were so sick So that was our global thing and then in the U。S。 both of us have had amazing educations could live up to its promise of equal opportunity is by having a phenomenal education system and the more we learned the more we realized we're not really fulfilling that promise And so we picked those two things and everything the foundation does is focused there So I asked each of you to pick an image that you like that illustrates your work and Melinda this is what you picked What's this about MG: So I one of the things I love to do when I travel is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women whether it's Bangladesh India lots of countries in Africa and I go in as a Western woman without a name I don't tell them who I am Pair of khakis I want to be able to use this shot I would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines But what about the shot I get which is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera which is a contraceptive And I would come back and talk to global health experts and they'd say Oh no contraceptives are stocked in in the developing world Well you had to dig deeper into the reports which is to have the number one thing that women tell you in Africa they want to use explains why women were saying to me I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it and I got to the clinic and there was nothing there And so condoms were stocked in in Africa because of all the AIDS work that the U。S and others supported But women will tell you over and over again I can't negotiate a condom with my husband I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS and I need that tool because then I can space the births of my children and I can feed them and have a chance of educating them Melinda you're Roman Catholic and you've often been embroiled and on the abortion question on both sides really How do you navigate that MG: Yeah so I think that's a really important point which is we had backed away from contraceptives as a global community were saying they wanted access to contraceptives even the contraceptives we have here in the United States and we weren't providing them because of the political controversy in our country and to me that was just a crime and I kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage and I finally realized I just had to do it And even though I'm Catholic just like most of the Catholic women in the United States who report using contraceptives around exactly this issue for women Bill this is your graph What's this about Well my graph has numbers on it I really like this graph This is the number of children who die before the age of five every year And what you find is really which is not widely known that we are making incredible progress to now we're down to about six million So this is a story largely of vaccines Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year That was eradicated so that got down to zero Measles was killing a couple million a year That's down to a few hundred thousand Anyway this is a chart where you want to get that number to continue and it's going to be possible getting the vaccines out to kids We can actually accelerate the progress The last decade than ever in history and so I just love the fact that you can say okay if we can invent new vaccines we can get them out there use the very latest understanding of these things and get the delivery right that we can perform a miracle I mean you do the math on this and it works out I think literally to thousands of kids' lives saved every day compared to the prior year It's not reported Does that drive you crazy Yeah because it's a silent thing going on It's a kid one kid at a time Ninety-eight percent of this has nothing to do with natural disasters and yet people's charity when they see a natural disaster are wonderful It's incredible how people think okay that could be me and the money flows These causes have been a bit invisible Now that the Millennium Development Goals we are seeing some increased generosity which should be possible in our lifetime Maybe it needed someone who is turned on by numbers and graphs rather than just the big sad face to get engaged I mean you've used it in your letter this year contrary to the current meme that aid is kind of worthless and broken that actually it has been effective Yeah well people can take there is some aid that was well-meaning and didn't go well that were well-meaning and didn't go well You shouldn't just say okay because of that because we don't have a perfect record this is a bad endeavor You should look at what was your goal How are you trying to uplift nutrition so these countries can take care of themselves and say wow this is going well and be smarter We can spend aid smarter It is not all a panacea We can do better than venture capital I think including big hits like this Traditional wisdom is that it's pretty hard for married couples to work together How have you guys managed it MG: Yeah I've had a lot of women say to me I really don't think I could work with my husband That just wouldn't work out You know we enjoy it and we don't -- in its continuous learning journey for the foundation actually as we used to when Bill was working at Microsoft We have more trips where we're traveling separately but I always know when I come home Bill's going to be interested in what I learned or something new about the vaccine delivery chain or this person that is a great leader He's going to listen and be really interested And he knows when he comes home even if it's to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he's learned I'm really interested and I think we have a really collaborative relationship But we don't every minute together that's for sure But now you are and we're very happy that you are Melinda early on you were basically largely running the show Six years ago I guess Bill came on full time so moved from Microsoft and became full time adjusting to that No MG: Yeah I think actually for the foundation employees there was way more angst for them than there was for me about Bill coming I was actually really excited I mean Bill made this decision and it was really his decision but again it was a beach vacation where we were walking on the beach and he was starting to think of this idea And for me the excitement of Bill against these huge global problems these inequities to me that was exciting Yes the foundation employees had angst about that That's cool MG: But that went away within three months once he was there Including some of the employees MG: That's what I said the employees it went away for them three months after you were there No I'm kidding MG: Oh you mean the employees didn't go away A few of them did but So what do you guys argue about Sunday 11 o'clock you're away from work what comes up What's the argument I had that with Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger and now Melinda and in even stronger equal ways is the partner so we talk a lot about which things should we give more to which groups are working well She's got a lot of insight She'll sit down with the employees a lot We'll take the different trips she described So there's a lot of collaboration I can't think of anything where one of us had a super strong opinion about one thing or another How about you Melinda though Can you MG: Well here's the thing We come at things from different angles and I actually think that's really good So Bill can look at the big data and say I want to act based on these global statistics For me I come at it from intuition I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill's taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match and I think what I've taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand can you actually deliver that vaccine in her child's mouth is every bit as important as the science So I think it's been more a coming to over time towards each other's point of view and quite frankly the work is better because of it So in vaccines and polio and so forth you've had some amazing successes What about failure though Can you talk about a failure and maybe what you've learned from it Yeah Fortunately we can afford a few failures because we've certainly had them that you know you're going to have different failures Like we put out one that got a lot of publicity was asking for a better condom Well we got hundreds of ideas Maybe a few of those will work out We were very naïve certainly I was about a drug for a disease in India visceral leishmaniasis that I thought once I got this drug every day for 10 days It took three more years to get it than we expected and then there was no way it was going to get out there Fortunately we found out that if you go kill the sand flies you probably can have success there but we spent five years you could say wasted five years and about 60 million very modest benefit when we got there You're spending like a billion dollars a year in education I think something like that Is anything the story of what's gone right there Are there any failures that you can talk about MG: Well I would say a huge lesson for us out of the early work is we thought that these small schools were the answer and small schools definitely help But the thing that we learned from that work and what turned out to be the fundamental key is a great teacher in front of the classroom If you don't have an effective teacher in the front of the classroom I don't care how big or small the building is you're not going to change the trajectory of whether that student will be ready for college So Melinda this is you and your eldest daughter Jenn And just taken about three weeks ago I think three or four weeks ago Where was this MG: So we went to Tanzania Jenn's been to Tanzania And we did something very different which is we decided to go spend two nights and three days with a family Anna and Sanare are the parents They invited us to come and stay in their boma Actually the goats had been there I think on their little compound before we got there and we really really learned what life is like in rural Tanzania or three quarters of a day versus staying overnight was profound and so let me just give you one explanation of that They had six children and as I talked to Anna in the cooking hut that day and as I talked to her she had absolutely planned and spaced with her husband the births of their children It was a very loving relationship This was a Maasai warrior and his wife they clearly had respect and love in the relationship Their children their six children the two in the middle were twins 13 a boy and a girl named Grace And when we'd go out to chop wood and do all the things that Grace and her mother would do Grace was not a child she was an adolescent but she wasn't an adult She was very very shy So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn We kept trying to engage her but she was shy And at night though when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania and there was no moon that night the first night and no stars and Jenn came out of our hut with her REI little headlamp on Grace went immediately and got the translator came straight up to my Jenn and said When you go home can I have your headlamp so I can study at night Oh wow MG: And her dad had told me how afraid he was that unlike the son who had passed his secondary exams and wasn't in the government school yet He said I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education I can't pay for private school and she may end up on this farm like my wife So they know the difference that an education can make in a huge profound way I mean this is another pic of your other two kids Rory and Phoebe along with Paul Farmer Bringing up three children when you're the world's richest family seems like a social experiment without much prior art How have you managed it What's been your approach Well I'd say overall the kids get a great education and what they're going to go and do to be very clear with them -- most of the money's going to the foundation -- and help them find something they're excited about We want to strike a balance where they have the freedom to do anything but not a lot of money showered on them so they could go out and do nothing And so far they're fairly diligent excited to pick their own direction You've obviously guarded their privacy carefully for obvious reasons I'm curious why you've given me permission to show this picture now here at TED MG: Well it's interesting As they get older they so know that our family belief is about responsibility that we are in an unbelievable situation just to live in the United States and have a great education and we have a responsibility to give back to the world And so as they get older and we are teaching them -- they have been to so many countries around the world they're saying we do want people to know that we believe in what you're doing Mom and Dad and it is okay to show us more So we have their permission to show this picture and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it about the mission of the foundation too You've easily got enough money to make them all billionaires Is that your plan for them Nope No They won't have anything like that They need to have a sense that their own work is meaningful and important We read an article long actually before we got married where Warren Buffett talked about that and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor either to society or to the kids Well speaking of Warren Buffett something really amazing happened in 2006 when somehow your only real rival 80 percent of his fortune to your foundation How on Earth did that happen I guess there's a long version and a short version of that We've got time for the short version All right Well Warren was a close friend and he was going to have his wife Suzie give it all away Tragically she passed away before he did and he's big on delegation and he said Tweet that If he's got somebody who is doing something well and is willing to do it at no charge maybe that's okay But we were stunned MG: Totally stunned We had never expected it and it has been unbelievable Half the resources we have come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity And I think you've pledged that by the time you're done more than or 95 percent of your wealth will be given to the foundation Yes And since this relationship it's amazing— And recently you and Warren more than half of their assets for philanthropy How is that going Well we've got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge The thing that's great is that we get together yearly and talk about okay do you hire staff what do you give to them We're not trying to homogenize it I mean the beauty of philanthropy is this mind-blowing diversity People give to some things We look and go Wow But that's great That's the role of philanthropy is to pick different approaches including even in one space like education We need more experimentation But it's been wonderful meeting those people sharing their journey to philanthropy how they involve their kids where they're doing it differently and it's been way more successful than we expected Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size in the years ahead MG: And having people see that other people I mean these are people who have put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas behind philanthropy they can change the world And they start to see others doing it and saying Wow I want to do that with my own money To me that's the piece that's incredible It seems to me it's actually really hard for some people to figure out on something else There are probably some billionaires in the room and certainly some successful people I'm curious can you make the pitch What's the pitch Well it's the most fulfilling thing we've ever done and you can't take it with you because of the philanthropists of the past and the U。S tradition here which is the strongest And part of the reason I'm so optimistic is because I do think philanthropy and take some of these things government's not just good at working on and discovering and shine some light in the right direction The world's got this terrible inequality growing inequality problem that seems structural It does seem to me that if more of your peers it would make a dent both in that problem and certainly in the perception of that problem Is that a fair comment Oh yeah If you take from the most wealthy and give to the least wealthy it's good It tries to balance out and that's just MG: But you change systems In the U。S。 we're trying to change the education system so it's just for everybody and it works for all students That to me really changes That's the most important Well I really think that most people here your lives have taken you have shaped the future Thank you so much for coming to TED and for sharing with us and for all you do Thank you MG: Thank you Thank you MG: Thank you very much All right good job My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust protect user rights and keep users safe both from each other and at times from themselves Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter Back in January 2009 we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform January 2014 more than 500 million We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes That's a 24，900-percent increase Now the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way There's no risk involved My job is to root out and prevent activity that might Sounds straightforward right You might even think it'd be easy given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities Given the scale that Twitter is at a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale For us edge cases those rare situations that are unlikely to occur are more like norms Say 99。999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone There's no threat involved Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef or tweeting about a concert they're attending or sharing pictures of cute baby animals After you take out that 99。999 percent that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150，000 per month The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge You know what else makes my role particularly challenging People do weird things And I have to figure out what they're doing why and whether or not there's risk involved often without much in terms of context or background I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter -- these are all real examples of situations that at first seemed cut and dried but the truth of the matter was something altogether different The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty We'll start off easy Yo bitch If you saw a Tweet that only said this you might think to yourself That looks like abuse After all why would you want to receive the message Yo bitch Now I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes so I knew that yo bitch was also often a common greeting between friends as well as being a popular Breaking Bad reference I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role-playing as dogs And in fact in that case it's not only not abusive it's technically just an accurate greeting So okay determining whether or not something is abusive without context definitely hard Let's look at spam Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior sending the exact same message to thousands of people While this is a mockup I put together using my account we see accounts doing this all the time Seems pretty straightforward We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam Okay Let's make the stakes higher Back to my account again exhibiting classic behavior This time it's sending the same message and link This is often indicative of something called phishing somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website That's pretty clearly not a good thing We want to and do suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior So why are the stakes higher for this Well this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non-violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors and even then we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate Now given the sorts of challenges I'm up against it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected And that's not just an issue for me or for Twitter it's an issue for you It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things So what do I do I pause and I think how could all of this go horribly wrong I visualize catastrophe And that's hard There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement But you still have to do it particularly if you're marrying 500 million tweets per day What do I mean by visualize catastrophe I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death and what to do to prevent that Which happens to be my next example This is my cat Eli We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets A picture is worth a thousand words You only get 140 characters You add a photo to your tweet look at how much more content you've got now There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet My job isn't to think of those It's to think of what could go wrong How could this picture lead to my death Well here's one possibility There's more in that picture than just a cat There's geodata When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image In fact this image also contains the equivalent of this more specifically this Sure it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat but I start by assuming the worst will happen That's why when we launched photos on Twitter we made the decision to strip that geodata out If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen it wouldn't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy It's not and I see a lot believe me -- are positive people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other It's just that for those of us dealing with scale for those of us tasked with keeping people safe we have to assume the worst will happen because for us a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds Thank you A herd of wildebeests a shoal of fish a flock of birds Many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world But why do these groups form The common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs or gathering to mate or breed and all of these explanations while often true make a huge assumption about animal behavior that the animals are in control of their own actions that they are in charge of their bodies And that is often not the case This is Artemia a brine shrimp You probably know it better as a sea monkey It's small and it typically lives alone but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters and these form because of a parasite These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm A tapeworm is effectively a long living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other As a freelance journalist I sympathize The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body but it also does other things It castrates them it changes their color from transparent to bright red it makes them live longer and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found it makes them swim in groups Why Because the tapeworm like many other parasites has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts The shrimp are just one step on its journey Its ultimate destination is this the greater flamingo Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm They aren't sociable through their own volition but because they are being controlled It's not safety in numbers It's actually the exact opposite The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation This is a suicidal cricket This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm or horsehair worm The worm grew to adult size within it but it needs to get into water in order to mate and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain causing it to behave erratically When the cricket nears a body of water such as this swimming pool it jumps in and drowns and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse Crickets are really roomy Who knew The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone They are part of an entire cavalcade of mind-controlling parasites of fungi viruses and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts Now I first learned about this way of life through David Attenborough's Trials of Life about 20 years ago and then later through a wonderful book called Parasite Rex by my friend Carl Zimmer And I've been writing about these creatures ever since Few topics in biology enthrall me more It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain Because after all they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre When you write about parasites your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its body But there's more to it than that I'm a writer and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories Parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories Their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations Why for example does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over Is it maybe protecting its siblings No This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body See what I mean Now the caterpillar didn't die Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons This caterpillar is a head-banging zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it We have a lot to get through I only have 13 minutes Now some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world that they are outliers and that point of view is understandable because by their nature parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things They're easy to overlook but that doesn't mean that they aren't important A few years back a man called Kevin Lafferty took a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find and what they found were parasites in extreme abundance Especially common were trematodes tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail Now a single trematode is tiny microscopic but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you the cricket thing One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout Manipulation is not an oddity It is a critical and common part of the world around us and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators and more excitingly they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts And this is one of my favorite examples This is Ampulex compressa the emerald cockroach wasp and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach When she finds one she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ This discovery came out three weeks ago She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag she finds the brain and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon It doesn't kill the roach nor does it sedate it The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to but it doesn't choose to because the venom nixes its motivation to walk and only that The wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box in the roach's operating system allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog And once there she lays an egg on it egg hatches devoured alive bursts out of body yadda yadda yadda you know the drill Now I would argue that once stung the cockroach isn't a roach anymore It's more of an extension of the wasp just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce They have as much control over their own fates as my car Once the parasites get in the hosts don't get a say Now humans of course are no stranger to manipulation We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind But our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp Now I think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling We place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and mind-controlling supervillains -- these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction but in nature they happen all the time Which leads me to an obvious and disquieting question: Are there dark sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it besides the NSA If there are any I've got a red dot on my forehead now don't I This is Toxoplasma gondii or Toxo for short because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname Toxo infects mammals a wide variety of mammals but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away The cat eats the rat Toxo gets to have sex It's a classic tale of Eat Prey Love You're very charitable generous people Hi Elizabeth I loved your talk How does the parasite control its host in this way We don't really know We know that Toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine a substance involved in reward and motivation We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain including those involved in sexual arousal But how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear What is clear is that this thing is a single cell This has no nervous system It has no consciousness It doesn't even have a body But it's manipulating a mammal We are mammals We are more intelligent than a mere rat to be sure but our brains have the same basic structure the same types of cells the same chemicals running through them and the same parasites Estimates vary a lot but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have Toxo in their brains Now typically this doesn't lead to any overt illness The parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long period of time But there's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents and there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected Now I think this evidence is still inconclusive and even among Toxo researchers opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior But given the widespread nature of such manipulations it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren't similarly affected And I think that this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing They're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing whether they're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling are not the results of individuals acting through their own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else And while that idea may be disquieting I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin At the end of On the Origin of Species Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful and I like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks But perhaps that's just a parasite talking Thank you Good morning When I was a little boy I had an experience that changed my life and is in fact why I'm here today That one moment profoundly affected how I think about art design and engineering As background I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world's great cities My dad John Ferren who died when I was 15 was an artist by both passion and profession as is my mom Rae He was one of the New York School abstract expressionists who together with his contemporaries invented American modern art and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist towards modernism in the 20th century Isn't it remarkable that after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art that modern art comparatively speaking is about 15 minutes old yet now pervasive As with many other important innovations those radical ideas required no new technology just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection In our home art was everywhere It was like oxygen around us and necessary for life As I watched him paint Dad taught me that art was not about being decorative but was a different way of communicating ideas and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight Given this rich artistic environment you'd assume that I would have been compelled to go into the family business but no I followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy I had no interest in becoming an artist certainly not a painter What I did love was electronics and machines -- taking them apart building new ones and making them work Fortunately my family also had engineers in it and with my parents these were my first role models What they all had in common was they worked very very hard My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn On weekends we would go together to Cortlandt Street which was New York City's radio row There we would explore massive piles of surplus electronics and for a few bucks bring home treasures like Norden bombsights and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers I found these objects both useful and fascinating I learned about engineering and how things worked not at school but by taking apart and studying these fabulously complex devices I did this for hours every day apparently avoiding electrocution Life was good However every summer sadly the machines got left behind while my parents and I traveled overseas to experience history art and design We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology Then when I was about nine years old we went to Rome On one particularly hot summer day we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting My dad said it was called the Pantheon a temple for all of the gods It didn't look all that special from the outside as I said but when we walked inside I was immediately struck by three things: First of all it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside It was very dark the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole but it was called the oculus an eye to the heavens And there was something about this place I didn't know why that just felt special As we walked to the center of the room I looked up at the heavens through the oculus This was the first church that I'd been to that provided an unrestricted view between God and man But I wondered what about when it rained Dad may have called this an oculus but it was in fact a big hole in the roof I looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor As I became more accustomed to the dark I was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls No big deal here just the same statuary stuff that we'd seen all over Rome In fact it looked like the Appian Way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to Hadrian and Hadrian said We'll take all of it But the ceiling was amazing It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome I'd seen these before and Bucky was friends with my dad It was modern high-tech impressive a huge 142-foot clear span which not coincidentally was exactly its height I loved this place It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before so I asked my dad When was this built He said About 2，000 years ago And I said No I mean the roof You see I assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war He said It's the original roof That moment changed my life and I can remember it as if it were yesterday For the first time I realized people were smart 2，000 years ago This had never crossed my mind I mean to me the pyramids at Giza we visited those the year before and sure they're impressive nice enough design but look give me an unlimited budget 20，000 to 40，000 laborers and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside and I'll build you pyramids too But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon not 2，000 years ago nor today And incidentally it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built To build the Pantheon took some miracles By miracles I mean things that are technically barely possible very high-risk and might not be actually accomplishable at this moment in time certainly not by you For example here are some of the Pantheon's miracles To make it even structurally possible they had to invent super-strong concrete and to control weight varied the density of the aggregate as they worked their way up the dome For strength and lightness the dome structure used five rings of coffers each of diminishing size which imparts a dramatic forced perspective to the design It was wonderfully cool inside because of its huge thermal mass natural convection of air rising up through the oculus and a Venturi effect when wind blows across the top of the building I discovered for the first time that light itself has substance The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable and I realized for the first time that light could be designed Further that of all of the forms of design visual design they were all kind of irrelevant without it because without light you can't see any of them I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special It survived gravity barbarians looters developers what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history Largely because of that visit I came to understand that contrary to what I was being told in school the worlds of art and design were not in fact incompatible with science and engineering I realized when combined you could create things that were amazing that couldn't be done in either domain alone But in school with few exceptions they were treated as separate worlds and they still are My teachers told me that I had to get serious and focus on one or the other However urging me to specialize only caused me to really appreciate those polymaths like Michelangelo Leonardo da Vinci Benjamin Franklin people who did exactly the opposite And this led me to embrace and want to be in both worlds So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the Pantheon actually happen Someone themselves perhaps Hadrian needed a brilliant creative vision They also needed the storytelling and leadership skills necessary to fund and execute it and a mastery of science and technology with the ability and knowhow to push existing innovations even farther It is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least five miracles The problem is no matter how talented rich or smart you are you only get one to one and a half miracles That's it That's the quota Then you run out of time money enthusiasm whatever Remember most people can't even imagine one of these technical miracles and you need at least five to make a Pantheon In my experience these rare visionaries who can think across the worlds of art design and engineering have the ability to notice when others have provided enough of the miracles to bring the goal within reach Driven by the clarity of their vision they summon the courage and determination to deliver the remaining miracles and they often take what other people think to be insurmountable obstacles and turn them into features Take the oculus of the Pantheon By insisting that it be in the design it meant you couldn't use much of the structural technology that had been developed for Roman arches However by instead embracing it and rethinking weight and stress distribution they came up with a design that only works if there's a big hole in the roof That done you now get the aesthetic and design benefits of light cooling and that critical direct connection with the heavens Not bad These people not only believed that the impossible can be done but that it must be done Enough ancient history What are some recent examples of innovations that combine creative design and technological advances in a way so profound that they will be remembered a thousand years from now Well putting a man on the moon was a good one and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either Talk about one giant leap: It's hard to imagine a more profound moment in human history than when we first left our world to set foot on another So what came after the moon One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet but I actually think that's quite wrong or at least it's only part of the story The Internet isn't a Pantheon It's more like the invention of concrete: important absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon and enduring but entirely insufficient by itself However just as the technology of concrete was critical in realization of the Pantheon new designers will use the technologies of the Internet to create novel concepts that will endure The smartphone is a perfect example Soon the majority of people on the planet will have one and the idea of connecting everyone to both knowledge and each other will endure So what's next What imminent advance will be the equivalent of the Pantheon Thinking about this I rejected many very plausible and dramatic breakthroughs to come such as curing cancer Why Because Pantheons are anchored in designed physical objects ones that inspire by simply seeing and experiencing them and will continue to do so indefinitely It is a different kind of language like art These other vital contributions that extend life and relieve suffering are of course critical and fantastic but they're part of the continuum of our overall knowledge and technology like the Internet So what is next Perhaps counterintuitively from the late 1930s that's been revived every decade since: autonomous vehicles Now you're thinking give me a break How can a fancy version of cruise control be profound Look much of our world has been designed around roads and transportation These were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity and development of the United States Today these roads that interconnect our world are dominated by cars and trucks that have remained largely unchanged for 100 years Although perhaps not obvious today autonomous vehicles will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and by extension civilization Here's why: Once they become ubiquitous each year these vehicles will save tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone and a million globally Automotive energy consumption and air pollution will be cut dramatically Much of the road congestion in and out of our cities will disappear They will enable compelling new concepts in how we design cities work and the way we live We will get where we're going faster and society will recapture vast amounts of lost productivity now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting But why now Why do we think this is ready Because over the last 30 years people from outside the automotive industry have spent countless billions creating the needed miracles but for entirely different purposes and companies completely outside of the automotive industry to notice that if you were clever about it autonomy could be done now So what are the five miracles needed for autonomous vehicles One you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is This was solved neatly by the GPS system Global Positioning System that the U。S Government put in place You need to know where all the roads are what the rules are and where you're going The various needs of personal navigation systems in-car navigation systems and web-based maps address this You must have near-continuous communication with high-performance computing networks and with others nearby to understand their intent The wireless technologies developed for mobile devices with some minor modifications are completely suitable to solve this You'll probably want some restricted roadways to get started that both society and its lawyers agree are safe to use for this This will start with the HOV lanes and move from there But finally you need to recognize people signs and objects Machine vision special sensors and high-performance computing can do a lot of this but it turns out a lot is not good enough when your family is on board Occasionally humans will need to do sense-making For this you might actually have to wake up your passenger and ask them what the hell that big lump is in the middle of the road Not so bad and it will give us a sense of purpose in this new world Besides once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant and it's okay to keep driving every other car on the surface of the Earth will know that from that point on Five miracles mostly delivered and now you just need a clear vision of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles with seductively beautiful and new functional designs plus a lot of money and hard work to bring it home The beginning is now only a handful of years away and I predict that autonomous vehicles will permanently change our world over the next several decades In conclusion I've come to believe that the ingredients for the next Pantheons are all around us just waiting for visionary people with the broad knowledge multidisciplinary skills and intense passion to harness them to make their dreams a reality But these people don't spontaneously pop into existence They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids We need to love them and help them discover their passions We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success as is perseverance We need to help them to find their own role models and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums we need to encourage them to find their own path even if it's very different from our own But a cautionary note: We also need to periodically pry them away from their modern miracles the computers phones tablets game machines and TVs take them out into the sunlight so they can experience both the natural and design wonders of our world our planet and our civilization If we don't they won't understand what these precious things are that someday they will be resopnsible for protecting and improving We also need them to understand something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated in our increasingly tech-dependent world that art and design are not luxuries nor somehow incompatible with science and engineering They are in fact essential to what makes us special Someday if you get the chance perhaps you can take your kids to the actual Pantheon as we will our daughter Kira to experience firsthand the power of that astonishing design which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome reached 2，000 years into the future to set the course for my life Thank you We had Edward Snowden here a couple days ago and this is response time And several of you have written to me with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director of the National Security Agency and he's a senior civilian officer there acts as its chief operating officer guiding strategies setting internal policies and serving as the principal advisor to the director And all being well welcome Rick Ledgett to TED Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here I look forward to the conversation so thanks for arranging for that Thank you Rick We appreciate you joining us It's certainly quite a strong statement that the NSA is willing to reach out and show a more open face here You saw I think the talk and interview that Edward Snowden gave here a couple days ago What did you make of it RL: So I think it was interesting We didn't realize that he was going to show up there so kudos to you guys for arranging a nice surprise like that I think that like a lot of the things that have come out since Mr Snowden started disclosing classified information there were some kernels of truth in there but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there and I'm interested in helping to address those I think this is a really important conversation that we're having in the United States and internationally and I think it is important and of import and so given that we need to have that be a fact-based conversation and we want to help make that happen So the question that a lot of people have here is what do you make of Snowden's motivations for doing what he did and did he have an alternative way that he could have gone RL: He absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone and I actually think that characterizing him as a whistleblower actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities So what if somebody who works in the NSA -- and there are over 35，000 people who do They're all great citizens They're just like your husbands fathers sisters brothers neighbors nephews friends and relatives all of whom are interested in doing the right thing for their country and for our allies internationally and so there are a variety of venues to address if folks have a concern First off there's their supervisor and up through the supervisory chain within their organization If folks aren't comfortable with that there are a number of inspectors general In the case of Mr Snowden he had the option of the NSA inspector general the Navy inspector general the Pacific Command inspector general the Department of Defense inspector general and the intelligence community inspector general any of whom would have both kept his concerns in classified channels and been happy to address them He had the option to go to congressional committees and there are mechanisms to do that that are in place and so he didn't do any of those things Now you had said that Ed Snowden had other avenues for raising his concerns The comeback on that is a couple of things: one that he certainly believes that as a contractor the avenues that would have been available to him as an employee weren't available two there's a track record of other whistleblowers like Thomas Andrews Drake being treated pretty harshly by some views and thirdly what he was taking on was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered but programs that had been approved by all three branches of government I mean in that circumstance couldn't you argue that what he did was reasonable RL: No I don't agree with that I think that the sorry I'm getting feedback through the microphone there the actions that he took were inappropriate because of the fact that he put people's lives at risk basically in the long run and I know there's been a lot of talk in public by Mr Snowden and some of the journalists that say that the things that have been disclosed have not put national security and people at risk and that is categorically not true They actually do I think there's also an amazing arrogance to the idea that he knows better than the framers of the Constitution in how the government should be designed and work for separation of powers and the fact that the executive and the legislative branch have to work together and they have checks and balances on each other and then the judicial branch which oversees the entire process I think that's extremely arrogant on his part Can you give a specific example of how he put people's lives at risk RL: Yeah sure So the things that he's disclosed the capabilities and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization so when we have foreign intelligence targets legitimate things of interest -- like terrorists is the iconic example but it includes things like human traffickers drug traffickers people who are trying to build advanced weaponry nuclear weapons and build delivery systems for those and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors which you may have some visibility into some of that that's going on right now the capabilities are applied in very discrete and measured and controlled ways So the unconstrained disclosure of those capabilities means that as adversaries see them and recognize Hey I might be vulnerable to this they move away from that and we have seen targets in terrorism in the nation-state area in smugglers of various types and other folks who have because of the disclosures moved away from our ability to have insight into what they're doing The net effect of that is that our people who are overseas in dangerous places whether they're diplomats or military and our allies who are in similar situations are at greater risk because we don't see the threats that are coming their way So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down has been closed down But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place I mean describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of RL: So there are when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology and they do because it's a great system it's the most complex system ever devised by man and it is a wonder and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that and it's just a wonderful thing But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies And so if I'm going to pursue them I need to have the capability to go after them and again the controls are in how I apply that capability not that I have the capability itself Otherwise if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet we could have a domain badguy。com That would be awesome and we could just concentrate all our efforts there That's not how it works They're trying to hide from the government's ability to isolate and interdict their actions and so we have to swim in that same space But I will tell you this So NSA has two missions One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press The other one is the Information Assurance mission which is to protect the national security systems of the United States and by that that's things like the communications that the president uses the communications that control our nuclear weapons the communications that our military uses around the world and the communications that we use with our allies and that some of our allies themselves use And so we make recommendations on standards to use and we use those same standards and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press for example It's the bringer of knowledge to all It's the connector of all And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms And from that lens what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read Can you understand that from that viewpoint it feels outrageous RL: I do understand that and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet It is a global telecommunications system The Internet is a big chunk of that but there is a lot more And I think that people have legitimate concerns about the balance between transparency and secrecy That's sort of been couched as a balance between privacy and national security I don't think that's the right framing I think it really is transparency and secrecy And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having and we want to participate in that and want people to participate in it in an informed way So there are things let me talk there a little bit more there are things that we need to be transparent about: our authorities our processes our oversight who we are We NSA have not done a good job of that and I think that's part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media Nobody knew who we were We were the No Such Agency the Never Say Anything There's takeoffs of our logo of an eagle with headphones on around it And so that's the public characterization And so we need to be more transparent about those things What we don't need to be transparent about because it's bad for the U。S。 it's bad for all those other countries that we work with and that we help provide information that helps them secure themselves and their people it's bad to expose operations and capabilities in a way that allows the people that we're all working against the generally recognized bad guys to counter those But isn't it also bad to deal a kind of body blow to the American companies that have essentially given the world most of the Internet services that matter RL: It is It's really the companies are in a tough position as are we because the companies we compel them to provide information just like every other nation in the world does Every industrialized nation in the world has a lawful intercept program where they are requiring companies to provide them with information that they need for their security and the companies that are involved have complied with those programs in the same way that they have to do when they're operating in Russia or the U。K or China or India or France any country that you choose to name And so the fact that these revelations have been broadly characterized as you can't trust company A because your privacy is suspect with them is actually only accurate in the sense that it's accurate with every other company in the world that deals with any of those countries in the world And so it's being picked up by people as a marketing advantage and it's being marketed that way by several countries including some of our allied countries where they are saying Hey you can't trust the U。S。 but you can trust our telecom company because we're safe And they're actually using that to counter the very large technological edge that U。S companies have in areas like the cloud and Internet-based technologies You're sitting there with the American flag and the American Constitution guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure How do you characterize the American citizen's right to privacy Is there such a right RL: Yeah of course there is And we devote an inordinate amount of time and pressure inordinate and appropriate actually I should say amount of time and effort in order to ensure that we protect that privacy and beyond that the privacy of citizens around the world it's not just Americans Several things come into play here First we're all in the same network My communications I'm a user of a particular Internet email service that is the number one email service of choice by terrorists around the world number one So I'm there right beside them in email space in the Internet And so we need to be able to pick that apart and find the information that's relevant In doing so we're going to necessarily encounter Americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out that says when you find that not if you find it when you find it because you're certain to find it here's how you protect that These are called minimization procedures They're approved by the attorney general and constitutionally based And so we protect those And then for people citizens of the world who are going about their lawful business on a day-to-day basis the president on his January 17 speech laid out some additional protections that we are providing to them So I think absolutely folks do have a right to privacy and that we work very hard to make sure that that right to privacy is protected What about foreigners using American companies' Internet services Do they have any privacy rights RL: They do They do in the sense of the only way that we are able to compel one of those companies to provide us information is when it falls into one of three categories: We can identify that this particular person identified by a selector of some kind is associated with counterterrorist or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target Much has been made of the fact that a lot of the information that you've obtained through these programs is essentially metadata It's not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call It's who they wrote to and when and so forth But it's been argued and someone here in the audience has talked to a former NSA analyst who said metadata is actually much more invasive than the core data because in the core data you present yourself as you want to be presented With metadata who knows what the conclusions are that are drawn Is there anything to that RL: I don't really understand that argument I think that metadata's important for a couple of reasons Metadata is the information that lets you find connections that people are trying to hide So when a terrorist is corresponding with somebody else who's not known to us but is engaged in doing or supporting terrorist activity or someone who's violating international sanctions by providing nuclear weapons-related material to a country like Iran or North Korea is trying to hide that activity because it's illicit activity What metadata lets you do is connect that The alternative to that is one that's much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy which is gigantic amounts of content collection So metadata in that sense actually is privacy-enhancing And we don't contrary to some of the stuff that's been printed we don't sit there and grind out metadata profiles of average people If you're not connected to one of those valid intelligence targets you are not of interest to us So in terms of the threats that face America overall where would you place terrorism RL: I think terrorism is still number one I think that we have never been in a time where there are more places where things are going badly and forming the petri dish in which terrorists take advantage of the lack of governance An old boss of mine Tom Fargo Admiral Fargo used to describe it as arcs of instability And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability in the world right now in places like Syria where there's a civil war going on and you have massive numbers thousands and thousands of foreign fighters who are coming into Syria to learn how to be terrorists and practice that activity and lots of those people are Westerners who hold passports to European countries or in some cases the United States and so they are basically learning how to do jihad and have expressed intent to go out and do that later on in their home countries You've got places like Iraq which is suffering from a high level of sectarian violence again a breeding ground for terrorism And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel area of Africa Again lots of weak governance which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity So I think it's very serious I think it's number one I think number two is cyber threat I think cyber is a threat in three ways: One way and probably the most common way that people have heard about it is due to the theft of intellectual property so basically foreign countries going in stealing companies' secrets and then providing that information to state-owned enterprises or companies connected to the government to help them leapfrog technology or to gain business intelligence that's then used to win contracts overseas That is a hugely costly set of activities that's going on right now Several nation-states are doing it Second is the denial-of-service attacks You're probably aware that there have been a spate of those directed against the U。S financial sector since 2012 Again that's a nation-state who is executing those attacks and they're doing that as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal And the last one is destructive attacks and those are the ones that concern me the most Those are on the rise You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012 August of 2012 It took down about 35，000 of their computers with a Wiper-style virus You had a follow-on a week later to a Qatari company You had March of 2013 you had a South Korean attack that was attributed in the press to North Korea that took out thousands of computers Those are on the rise and we see people expressing interest in those capabilities and a desire to employ them Okay so a couple of things here because this is really the core of this almost I mean first of all a lot of people who look at risk and look at the numbers don't understand this belief that terrorism is still the number one threat Apart from September 11 I think the numbers are that in the last 30 or 40 years about 500 Americans have died from terrorism mostly from homegrown terrorists The chance in the last few years of being killed by terrorism is far less than the chance of being killed by lightning I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident or bioterrorism act or something like that would change those numbers Would that be the point of view RL: Well I'd say two things One is the reason that there hasn't been a major attack in the United States since 9/11 that is not an accident That's a lot of hard work that we have done that other folks in the intelligence community have done that the military has done and that our allies around the globe have done You've heard the numbers about the tip of the iceberg in terms of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs contributed to stopping was 54 25 of those in Europe and of those 25 18 of them occurred in three countries some of which are our allies and some of which are beating the heck out of us over the NSA programs by the way So that's not an accident that those things happen That's hard work That's us finding intelligence on terrorist activities and interdicting them through one way or another through law enforcement through cooperative activities with other countries and sometimes through military action The other thing I would say is that your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat is not at all far-fetched and in fact there are a number of groups who have for several years expressed interest and desire in obtaining those capabilities and work towards that It's also been said that of those 54 alleged incidents that as few as zero of them were actually anything to do with these controversial programs that Mr Snowden revealed that it was basically through other forms of intelligence that you're looking for a needle in a haystack and the effects of these programs these controversial programs is just to add hay to the stack not to really find the needle The needle was found by other methods Isn't there something to that RL: No there's actually two programs that are typically implicated in that discussion One is the section 215 program the U。S telephony metadata program and the other one is popularly called the PRISM program and it's actually section 702 of the FISA Amendment Act But the 215 program is only relevant to threats that are directed against the United States and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated Now what you'll see people say publicly is there is no but for case and so there is no case where but for that the threat would have happened But that actually indicates a lack of understanding of how terrorist investigations actually work You think about on television you watch a murder mystery What do you start with You start with a body and then they work their way from there to solve the crime We're actually starting well before that hopefully before there are any bodies and we're trying to build the case for who the people are what they're trying to do and that involves massive amounts of information Think of it is as mosaic and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic was necessary to building the mosaic but to build the complete picture you need to have all the pieces of information On the other the non-U。S。-related threats out of those 54 the other 42 of them the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that and in fact was material in contributing to stopping those attacks Snowden said two days ago that terrorism has always been what is called in the intelligence world a cover for action that it's something that because it invokes such a powerful emotional response in people it allows the initiation of these programs to achieve powers that an organization like yours couldn't otherwise have Is there any internal debate about that RL: Yeah I mean we debate these things all the time and there is discussion that goes on in the executive branch and within NSA itself and the intelligence community about what's right what's proportionate what's the correct thing to do And it's important to note that the programs that we're talking about were all authorized by two different presidents two different political parties by Congress twice and by federal judges 16 different times and so this is not NSA running off and doing its own thing This is a legitimate activity of the United States foreign government that was agreed to by all the branches of the United States government and President Madison would have been proud And yet when congressmen discovered what was actually being done with that authorization many of them were completely shocked Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction that it's only because it's now come out publicly that they really knew exactly what you were doing with the powers they had granted you RL: Congress is a big body There's 535 of them and they change out frequently in the case of the House every two years and I think that the NSA provided all the relevant information to our oversight committees and then the dissemination of that information by the oversight committees throughout Congress is something that they manage I think I would say that Congress members had the opportunity to make themselves aware and in fact a significant number of them the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility did have the ability to do that And you've actually had the chairs of those committees say that in public Now you mentioned the threat of cyberattacks and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree that that is a huge concern but do you accept that there's a tradeoff between offensive and defensive strategies and that it's possible that the very measures taken to weaken encryption and allow yourself to find the bad guys might also open the door to forms of cyberattack RL: So I think two things One is you said weaken encryption I didn't And the other one is that the NSA has both of those missions and we are heavily biased towards defense and actually the vulnerabilities that we find in the overwhelming majority of cases we disclose to the people who are responsible for manufacturing or developing those products We have a great track record of that and we're actually working on a proposal right now to be transparent and to publish transparency reports in the same way that the Internet companies are being allowed to publish transparency reports for them We want to be more transparent about that So again we eat our own dog food We use the standards we use the products that we recommend and so it's in our interest to keep our communications protected in the same way that other people's need to be Edward Snowden when after his talk was wandering the halls here in the bot and I heard him say to a couple of people they asked him about what he thought of the NSA overall and he was very complimentary about the people who work with you said that it's a really impassioned group of employees who are seeking to do the right thing and that the problems have come from just some badly conceived policies He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly He didn't come over like a crazy man Would you accept that at least even if you disagree with how he did it that he has opened a debate that matters RL: So I think that the discussion is an important one to have I do not like the way that he did it I think there were a number of other ways that he could have done that that would have not endangered our people and the people of other nations through losing visibility into what our adversaries are doing But I do think it's an important conversation It's been reported that there's almost a difference of opinion with you and your colleagues over any scenario in which he might be offered an amnesty deal I think your boss General Keith Alexander has said that that would be a terrible example for others; you can't negotiate with someone who's broken the law in that way But you've been quoted as saying that if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering all undisclosed documents that a deal maybe should be considered Do you still think that RL: Yeah so actually this is my favorite thing about that 60 Minutes interview was all the misquotes that came from that What I actually said in response to a question about would you entertain any discussions of mitigating action against Snowden I said yeah it's worth a conversation This is something that the attorney general of the United States and the president also actually have both talked about this and I defer to the attorney general because this is his lane But there is a strong tradition in American jurisprudence of having discussions with people who have been charged with crimes in order to if it benefits the government to get something out of that that there's always room for that kind of discussion So I'm not presupposing any outcome but there is always room for discussion To a lay person it seems like he has certain things to offer the U。S。 the government you others in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy a smarter way forward for the future Do you see has that kind of possibility been entertained at all RL: So that's out of my lane That's not an NSA thing That would be a Department of Justice sort of discussion I'll defer to them Rick when Ed Snowden ended his talk I offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading What would be your idea worth spreading for this group RL: So I think learn the facts This is a really important conversation and it impacts it's not just NSA it's not just the government it's you it's the Internet companies The issue of privacy and personal data is much bigger than just the government and so learn the facts Don't rely on headlines don't rely on sound bites don't rely on one-sided conversations So that's the idea I think worth spreading We have a sign a badge tab we wear badges at work with lanyards and if I could make a plug my badge lanyard at work says Dallas Cowboys Go Dallas I've just alienated half the audience I know So the lanyard that our people who work in the organization that does our crypto-analytic work have a tab that says Look at the data So that's the idea worth spreading Look at the data Rick it took a certain amount of courage I think actually to come and speak openly to this group It's not something the NSA has done a lot of in the past and plus the technology has been challenging We truly appreciate you doing that and sharing in this very important conversation Thank you so much RL: Thanks Chris I've come here today to talk to you about a problem It's a very simple yet devastating problem one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us The problem is anonymous companies It sounds like a really dry and technical thing doesn't it But anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out the actual human beings responsible sometimes for really terrible crimes So why am I here talking to all of you Well I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and I to question authority I don't think they knew where it might lead And they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when predictably I questioned their authority a lot And a lot of my school teachers didn't appreciate it much either You see since the age of about five I've always asked the question but why But why does the Earth go around the sun But why is blood red But why do I have to go to school But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do And so it was in my twenties a long time ago that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London I was sitting with Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group where we worked at the time And as usual we were talking about the world's problems And in particular we were talking about the civil war in Cambodia And we had talked about that many many times before But then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other and said but why don't we try and change this And from that slightly crazy question over two decades and many campaigns later including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war from that crazy question Global Witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners investigators journalists and lawyers And we're all driven by the same belief that change really is possible So what exactly does Global Witness do We investigate we report to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict -- for stealing millions from citizens around the world also known as state looting and for destroying the environment And then we campaign hard to change the system itself And we're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet And much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices And one of these is anonymous companies Now we've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations like in the Democratic Republic of Congo where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars That's twice the country's health and education budget combined Or in Liberia where an international predatory logging company used front companies as it attempted to grab a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests Or political corruption in Sarawak Malaysia which has led to the destruction of much of its forests Well that uses anonymous companies too We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies And the awful thing is there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel the Zetas who use anonymous companies to launder profits while their drugs-related violence is tearing communities apart across the Americas Or the anonymous company which bought up Americans' tax debts piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice: Pay up or lose your home Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars and not being able to find out who you were really up against Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too As the Iranian government found out when through a series of front companies it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan on Fifth Avenue despite American sanctions And Juicy Couture home of of the velvet track suit and other companies were the unwitting unknowing tenants there There are just so many examples the horesemeat scandal in Europe the Italian mafia they've used these companies for decades The $100 million American Medicare fraud the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in Eastern Europe in the early '90s Anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the Ukraine But for every case that we and others expose there are so many more that will remain hidden away because of the current system And it's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes for stealing from you and me and millions of others they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and they're doing this with ease and they're doing it using legal structures And really that is unfair Well you might well ask what exactly is an anonymous company and can I really set one up and use it without anyone knowing who I am Well the answer is yes you can But if you're anything like me you'll want to see some of that for yourself so let me show you Well first you need to work out where you want to set it up Now at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here's the thing shockingly my own hometown London and indeed the U。K。 is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company And the other even better I'm afraid that's America Do you know in some states across America you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card like Delaware which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company Okay so let's say it's America and let's say it's Delaware and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider These are the companies that can set your one up for you and remember it's all legal routine business practice So here's one but there are plenty of others to choose from And having made your choice you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a contact name and address But don't worry it doesn't have to be your name It can be your lawyer's or your service provider's and it's not for the public record anyway And then you add the owner of the company Now this is the key part and again it doesn't have to be you because you can get creative because there is a whole universe out there of nominees to choose from And nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company's owner And if you don't want to involve anyone else it doesn't even have to be an actual human being It could be another company And then finally give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment And then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it But there you are in 10 minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company And not only is it easy really really easy and cheap it's totally legal too But the fun doesn't have to end there maybe you want to be even more anonymous Well that's no problem either You can simply keep adding layers companies owned by companies You can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries like a giant web each layer adds anonymity Each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is But whose interests is this all serving It might be in the interests of the company or a particular individual but what about all of us the public There hasn't even been a global conversation yet about whether it's okay to misuse companies in this way And what does it all mean for us Well an example that really haunts me is one I came across recently And it's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in Buenos Aires about a decade ago It was the night before New Year's Eve Three thousand very happy revelers many of them teenagers were crammed into a space meant for 1，000 And then tragedy struck a fire broke out plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling and toxic smoke filled the club So people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut Over 200 people died Seven hundred were injured trying to get out And as the victims' families and the city and the country reeled in shock investigators tried to find out who was responsible And as they looked for the owners of the club they found instead anonymous companies and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies Now ultimately a range of people were charged and some went to jail But this was an awful tragedy and it shouldn't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths Because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away Why should tax evaders corrupt government officials arms traders and more be able to hide their identities from us the public Why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice Anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it wasn't always this way Companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line Companies were created to limit financial risk they were never intended to be used as a moral shield Companies were never intended to be anonymous and they don't have to be And so I come to my wish My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good Together let's ignite world opinion change the law and launch a new era of openness in business So what might this look like Well imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company Imagine if this data were open and free accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike Imagine what a game changer that would be So how are we going to do this Well there is only one way Together we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes And yes this is ambitious but there is momentum on this issue and over the years I have seen the sheer power of momentum and it's just starting on this issue There is such an opportunity right now And the TED community of creative and innovative thinkers and doers across all of society could make the crucial difference You really can make this change happen Now a simple starting point is the address behind me for a Facebook page that you can join now to support the campaign and spread the word It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning And the techies among you you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue The U。K government is already on board; it supports these public registries And just last week the European Parliament came on board with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries That is momentum But it's early days America still needs to come on board as do so many other countries And to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians because without that real far-reaching world-shifting change just isn't going to happen Because this isn't just about changing the law this is about starting a conversation about what it's okay for companies to do and in what ways is it acceptable to use company structures This isn't just a dry policy issue This is a human issue which affects us all This is about being on the right side of history Global citizens innovators business leaders individuals we need you Together let's kickstart this global movement Let's just do it let's end anonymous companies Thank you What's the scariest thing you've ever done Or another way to say it is what's the most dangerous thing that you've ever done And why did you do it I know what the most dangerous thing is that I've ever done because NASA does the math You look back to the first five shuttle launches the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 74 shuttle flight the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so -- one in 35 one in 40 Not great odds so it's a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and you're going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day you're either going to be floating effortlessly gloriously in space or you'll be dead You go into at the Kennedy Space Center the suit-up room the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center it's normally predawn and in the distance lit up by the huge xenon lights is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed almost holding hands looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger We ride the elevator up and we crawl in on your hands and knees into the spaceship one at a time and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back And the hatch is closed and suddenly what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real something that I dreamed about in fact that I chose to do when I was nine years old is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening In the astronaut business -- the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it's the most complicated flying machine ever built And in the astronaut business we have a saying which is there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse And so you're very conscious in the cockpit; you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through And as the time gets closer and closer this excitement is building And then about three and a half minutes before launch the huge nozzles on the back like the size of big church bells swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle like the vehicle is alive underneath you like an elephant getting up off its knees or something And then about 30 seconds before launch the vehicle is completely alive -- it is ready to go -- the APUs are running the computers are all self-contained it's ready to leave the planet And 15 seconds before launch this happens: Voice: 12 11 10 nine eight seven six -- -- start two one booster ignition and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery returning to the space station paving the way 。。 Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space accelerating wildly straight up shouldering your way through the air and you're in a very complex place -- paying attention watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face After two minutes those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines the hydrogen and oxygen and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated You get lighter and lighter the force gets on us heavier and heavier It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something Until finally after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so we are finally at exactly the right altitude exactly the right speed the right direction the engine shut off and we're weightless And we're alive It's an amazing experience But why would we take that risk Why would you do something that dangerous In my case the answer is fairly straightforward I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that But the real question is how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it How do you deal with fear versus danger And having the goal in mind thinking about where it might lead directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second eight kilometers a second around the world 16 times a day with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside But maybe even more importantly allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means to be able to look down and have -- if your jaw could drop it would -- the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic constantly changing beauty that is the world itself And you see because of the speed a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit and you're going through space with the world It's an entirely different perspective you're not looking up at the universe you and the Earth are going through the universe together And you're holding on with one hand looking at the world turn beside you It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything it's unfathomable blackness with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into and you are holding on with one hand one link to the other seven billion people And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind and I didn't know why Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working I was thinking what do I do next I thought well maybe that's why we have two eyes so I kept working But unfortunately without gravity tears don't fall So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes goosh into your other eye and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship So what's the scariest thing you've ever done Maybe it's spiders A lot of people are afraid of spiders I think you should be afraid of spiders -- spiders are creepy and they've got long hairy legs and spiders like this one the brown recluse -- it's horrible If a brown recluse bites you you end with one of these horrible big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you in fact And how do you know And so a spider lands on you and you go through this great spasmy attack because spiders are scary But then you could say well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not I don't know Are there brown recluses here So if you actually do the research you find out that in the world there are about 50，000 different types of spiders and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50，000 And if you're in Canada because of the cold winters here in B。C。 there's about 720 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous and its venom isn't even fatal it's just kind of like a nasty sting And that spider -- not only that but that spider has beautiful markings on it it's like I'm dangerous I got a big radiation symbol on my back it's the black widow So if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider -- and it lives close the ground you're walking along you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you Spider webs like this it doesn't build those it builds them down in the corners And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn't care about you So in fact the next time you walk into a spiderweb you don't need to panic and go with your caveman reaction The danger is entirely different than the fear How do you get around it though How do you change your behavior Well next time you see a spiderweb have a good look make sure it's not a black widow spider and then walk into it And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff It's not a big deal And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior your caveman reaction and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb -- or into your grandma's attic or whatever into your own basement And you can apply this to anything If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded your natural reaction would be to panic I think It would make you nervous and worried But we had considered all the venom and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times And we don't just practice things going right we practice things going wrong all the time so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs And not just underwater but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time And even if you're blinded your natural panicky reaction doesn't happen Instead you kind of look around and go Okay I can't see but I can hear I can talk Scott Parazynski is out here with me He could come over and help me We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to I could find my own way back It's not nearly as big a deal And actually if you keep on crying for a while whatever that gunk was that's in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again and Houston if you negotiate with them they will let you then keep working We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes and it turned out it was just the anti-fog sort of a mixture of oil and soap that got in my eye And now we use Johnson's No More Tears which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger where is the real risk What is the real thing that you should be afraid of Not just a generic fear of bad things happening You can fundamentally change your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you 。。 where you could see the hardpan south of the Sahara or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike or the unconscious gingham of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened It's time to come home at the end This is our spaceship the Soyuz that little one Three of us climb in and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere These two parts here actually melt we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in and it falls into the atmosphere and in essence you are riding a meteorite home and riding meteorites is scary and it ought to be But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth -- -- instead 20 years previously we had started studying Russian and then once you learn Russian then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian and then we learned vehicle control theory and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again And in fact you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth So in fact when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz we weren't screaming we were laughing; it was fun And when the great big parachute opened we knew that if it didn't open there's a second parachute and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism So we came back we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz in Kazakhstan Reporter: And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds a。m Central Time CH: And you roll to a stop and it tumbles end over end but you're ready for it you're in a custom-built seat you know how the shock absorber works And then eventually the Russians reach in drag you out plunk you into a chair and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy which were impossible and dauntingly scary dauntingly terrifying and put them into practice and figured out a way to reprogram yourself to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise Just to finish they asked me to play that guitar I know this song and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself but it's also I think a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe we are people and we're taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place This is Major Tom to ground control I've left forevermore And I'm floating in a most peculiar way And the stars look very different today For here am I floating in the tin can A last glimpse of the world Planet Earth is blue and there's so much left to do Fear not That's very nice of you Thank you very much Thank you I'd like to talk today about how we can change our brains and our society Meet Joe Joe's 32 years old and a murderer I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London I'd like you to imagine this place It looks and feels like it sounds: Wormwood Scrubs Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept These individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil And I was there to study their brains I was part of a team of researchers from University College London on a grant from the U。K department of health My task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths That meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population What lay at the root of their behavior Was there a neurological cause for their condition And if there was a neurological cause could we find a cure So I'd like to speak about change and especially about emotional change Growing up I was always intrigued by how people change My mother a clinical psychotherapist would occasionally see patients at home in the evening She would shut the door to the living room and I imagined magical things happened in that room At the age of five or six I would creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door On more than one occasion I fell asleep and they had to push me out of the way at the end of the session And I suppose that's how I found myself walking into the secure interview room on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs Joe sat across a steel table and greeted me with this blank expression The prison warden looking equally indifferent said Any trouble just press the red buzzer and we'll be around as soon as we can I sat down The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me I looked up at the red buzzer far behind Joe on the opposite wall I looked at Joe Perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could Ah don't worry about the buzzer it doesn't work anyway Over the subsequent months we tested Joe and his fellow inmates looking specifically at their ability to categorize different images of emotion And we looked at their physical response to those emotions So for example when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad we instantly have a slight measurable physical response: increased heart rate sweating of the skin Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately they failed to show the emotions required They failed to show a physical response It was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy So we wanted to look closer at this to use MRI to image their brains That turned out to be not such an easy task Imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central London in shackles and handcuffs in rush hour and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner you have to remove all metal objects including shackles and handcuffs and as I learned all body piercings After some time however we had a tentative answer These individuals were not just the victims of a troubled childhood There was something else People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy Normally the more empathic a person is the larger and more active their amygdala is Our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior So let's take a step back Normally acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up like learning to speak At the age of six months virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects At the age of 12 months most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others So for example your mother raises her hands to stretch and you imitate her behavior At first this isn't perfect I remember my cousin Sasha two years old at the time looking through a picture book and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand Bit by bit we build the foundations of the social brain so that by the time we're three four years old most children not all have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others another prerequisite for empathy The fact that this developmental progression is universal irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn If you doubt this try as I've done to renege on a promise you've made to a four-year-old You will find that the mind of a four-year old is not naïve in the slightest It is more akin to a Swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development and a sharp sense of fairness The early years are crucial There seems to be a window of opportunity after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult like adults learning a foreign language That's not to say it's impossible A recent wonderful study from Stanford University showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards Now I'm not suggesting we endow criminals with superpowers but I am suggesting that we need to find ways to get Joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior for their benefit and for the benefit of the rest of us So can brains change For over 100 years neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood no new brain cells could grow in the adult human brain The brain could only change within certain set limits That was the dogma But then in the 1990s studies starting showing following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain first in the olfactory bulb which is responsible for our sense of smell then in the hippocampus involving short-term memory and finally in the amygdala itself In order to understand how this process works I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development Instead of psychopaths I studied mice because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage a shoebox essentially with cotton wool alone and without much stimulation not only does it not thrive but it will often develop strange repetitive behaviors This naturally sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice even becoming aggressive when introduced to them However mice reared in what we called an enriched environment a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore demonstrate neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells and as we showed they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks Now they don't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street but their improved environment results in healthy sociable behavior Mice reared in a standard cage by contrast not dissimilar you might say from a prison cell have dramatically lower levels of new neurons in the brain It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals including primates like us can show neurogenesis In some areas of the brain more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed We're just beginning to understand what exact function these cells have but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change way into adulthood However our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment Stress hormones glucocorticoids released by the brain suppress the growth of these new cells The more stress the less brain development which in turn causes less adaptability and causes higher stress levels This is the interplay between nature and nurture in real time in front of our eyes When you think about it it is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth Of course imprisonment is a necessary part of the criminal justice system and of protecting society Our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their MRI scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala The evidence is actually the other way Because our brains are capable of change we need to take responsibility for our actions and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation One way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs Here victims if they choose to participate and perpetrators meet face to face in safe structured encounters and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and the victim plays an active role in the process In such a setting the perpetrator can see perhaps for the first time the victim as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response This stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration Such programs won't work for everyone but for many it could be a way to break the frozen sea within So what can we do now How can we apply this knowledge I'd like to leave you with three lessons that I learned The first thing that I learned was that we need to change our mindset Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago society has advanced in virtually every aspect in the way we run our schools our hospitals Yet the moment we speak about prisons it's as though we're back in Dickensian times if not medieval times For too long I believe we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human nature cannot change and as a society it's costing us dearly We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change and the best way to achieve that even in adults is to change and modulate our environment The second thing I have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral to bringing about social change It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner Well actually that turns out not to be so easy but ultimately what we want to show is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates In order to answer complex questions like that we need people of different backgrounds -- lab-based scientists and clinicians social workers and policy makers philanthropists and human rights activists to work together Finally I believe we need to change our own amygdalae because this issue goes to the heart not just of who Joe is but who we are We need to change our view of Joe as someone wholly irredeemable because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable how is he going to see himself as any different In another decade Joe will be released from Wormwood Scrubs Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system Wouldn't it be better if while serving his sentence Joe was able to train his amygdala which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released Surely that would be in the interest of all of us Thank you I'm going to talk about hackers And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin but I'm going to explain to you why it should be The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity or of an international rogue with a political agenda And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of But like most things in technology and the technology world hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system and it is a deeply democratic activity It's about critical thinking It's about questioning existing ways of doing things and not just complain about it And in many ways hacking is what built America Betsy Ross was a hacker The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy So if there's one thing I want to leave you here with today it's that the next time you think about who a hacker is you think not of this guy but of this guy Benjamin Franklin who was one of the greatest hackers of all time He was one of America's most prolific inventors though he famously never filed a patent because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available on the invention of American democracy And in Code For America we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action He believed that government could be built by the people and we call those people civic hackers So it's no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise are the same values that underly the Internet And so it's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like I want to make clear that you don't have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker You just have to believe that you can bring a 21st-century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn't understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects So keep that in mind So what does civic hacking look like Our team last year in Honolulu which in this case was three full-time fellows who were doing a year of public service were asked by the city to rebuild the website And it's a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn't going to be possible in the few months that they had So instead they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website They're looking for answers to questions and they want to take action when they're done which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this So our team built Honolulu Answers which is a super-simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action Now the site itself was easy enough to build but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content It would have taken the three of them a very long time especially given that none of them are actually from Honolulu And so they did something that's really radical when you think about how government is used to working They asked citizens to write the content where on one Saturday afternoon -- Wild pigs are a huge problem in Honolulu apparently In one Saturday afternoon they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions but more importantly than that they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government Now I think this is a really cool story in and of itself but it gets more awesome On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland where I live the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers and again we held a write-a-thon and had citizens write the answers to them and I got into the act I authored this answer and a few others And I'm trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government At this point you may be wondering what city officials think of all this They actually love it As most of you guys know cities are being asked every day to do more with less and they're always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government Now I don't want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon It's happening across the globe and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City where earlier this year the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House And the contract was a two-year contract for 9。3 million dollars Now a lot of people were really angry about this especially geeks who knew that 9。3 million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app But instead of taking to the streets they issued a challenge They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper and they offered a prize of 9，300 dollars -- 10，000 times cheaper than the government contract and they gave the entrants 10 days And in those 10 days they submitted 173 apps and are still in the app store today And because of this action that contract was vacated and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners Code for Mexico City And so what you see in all three of these places in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking It's citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them and through that work they're creating a 21st-century ecosystem of participation They're creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved besides voting or signing a petition or protesting They can actually build government So back to our friend Ben Franklin who one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia called a brigade And it's because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city so in true civic hacker fashion they built a solution And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I've just described and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps and come join us We have 31 brigades in the U。S We are pleased to announce today that we're opening up the brigade to international cities for the first time starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland You can find out if there's a brigade where you live at brigade。codeforamerica。org and if there's not a brigade where you live we will help you We've created a tool kit which also lives at brigade。codeforamerica。org and we will support you along the way Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems that will support local government and that will empower citizens So please come hack with us Thank you I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation All right Are you with me Yeah Yeah All right So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a heterosexual couple having sex Could be the neighbors hotel room your parents Sorry Okay Pretty much everybody Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman I see one guy there It doesn't count if it was you sir So his hand's down And one woman Okay Sitting next to a loud guy Now what does this tell us It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex and it's generally the woman who makes more noise This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd I wasn't even going to mention this but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer So I thought got to talk about that We'll get back to that a little bit later Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes despite what you may have heard We are apes We are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant as Jared Diamond pointed out in one of his early books We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas orangutans what have you So we're extremely closely related to them and as you'll see in terms of our behavior we've got some relationship as well So what I'm asking today the question I want to explore with you today is what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality Now since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution and you're all familiar with it even if you haven't read this stuff The idea is that as part of human nature from the beginning of our species' time men have sort of leased women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services Generally we're talking about meat shelter status protection things like that or at least a promise of fidelity Now this sets men and women up in an oppositional relationship The war between the sexes is built right into our DNA according to this vision Right What Cacilda and I have argued is that no this economic relationship this oppositional relationship is actually an artifact of agriculture which only arose about 10，000 years ago at the earliest Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200，000 years so we're talking about five percent at most of our time as a modern distinct species So before agriculture before the agricultural revolution it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism They not only share things they demand that things be shared: meat shelter protection all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity it turns out are shared widely among these societies Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages and I'm not saying modern day hunter-gatherers are noble savages either What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context And there's really no argument about this among anthropologists All Cacilda and I have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved until agriculture as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex flexible social systems networks that our ancestors were very good at and that's why our species has survived so well Now this makes some people uncomfortable and so I always need to take a moment in these talks to say listen I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous but I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers There were no strangers Right In a hunter-gatherer band there are no strangers You've known these people your entire life So I'm saying yes there were overlapping sexual relationships that our ancestors probably had several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives But I'm not saying they were having sex with strangers I'm not saying that they didn't love the people they were having sex with And I'm not saying there was no pair-bonding going on I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive And those of us who have chosen to be monogamous -- my parents for example have been married for 52 years monogamously and if it wasn't monogamously Mom and Dad I don't want to hear about it— I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism You can choose to be a vegetarian but don't think that just because you've made that decision bacon suddenly stops smelling good Okay So this is my point That one took a minute to sink in huh Now in addition to being a great genius a wonderful man a wonderful husband a wonderful father Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude All right He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates including chimps and bonobos because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond right Chimps and bonobos Darwin didn't really know this but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings Interestingly chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent roughly of their menstrual cycle bonobos 90 percent and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle whether she's menstruating whether she's post-menopausal whether she's already pregnant This is vanishingly rare among mammals So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality Now Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day as scientists tend to do sometimes So what we're talking about is sperm competition Now the average human ejaculate has about 300 million sperm cells so it's already a competitive environment The question is whether these sperm are competing against other men's sperm or just their own There's a lot to talk about in this chart The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human That indicates female copulatory vocalization Just look at the numbers The average human has sex about 1，000 times per birth If that number seems high for some of you I assure you it seems low for others in the room We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos We don't share it with the other three apes the gorilla the orangutan and the gibbon who are more typical of mammals having sex only about a dozen times per birth Humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive And you'll see that the human chimp and bonobo we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage you expect a party to happen at any moment and you need to be ready That's what the external testicles are They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations I'm sorry It's true The human some of you will be happy to hear has the largest thickest penis of any primate Now this evidence goes way beyond anatomy It goes into anthropology as well Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution These women are the Mosuo from southwestern China In their society everyone men and women are completely sexually autonomous There's no shame associated with sexual behavior Women have hundreds of partners It doesn't matter Nobody cares Nobody gossips It's not an issue When the woman becomes pregnant the child is cared for by her her sisters and her brothers The biological father is a nonissue we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity These people actually believe -- and they have no contact among them no common language or anything so it's not an idea that spread it's an idea that's arisen around the world -- they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy the funny guy and the strong guy to get the essence of each of these men into the baby and then when the child is born these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book Now why does this matter Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation I think that's true This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering My hope is that a more accurate updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves for each other greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior Thank you And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet We all have closets we have to come out of Right And when we do come out of those closets we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other our fight is with an outdated Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa Thank you Thank you Christopher Ryan: Thank you So a question about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today Someone could give a talk and say look at us we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons and if you look at lots of societies around the world you'll see very high rates of violence Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism but it's not who you are from the talk you gave CR: Well first of all the evidence is very debatable But that's just an example Certainly you know lots of people say to me just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that way now and I agree with that Everyone has to respond to the modern world But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories And so you could live on McDonald's and milkshakes but your body will rebel against that We have appetites I think it was Schopenhauer who said a person can do what they want but not want what they want And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people there's something wrong with you there's something wrong with your marriage something wrong with your partner I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality That's what I'm trying to get at Thank you Communicated powerfully Thanks a lot CR: Thank you Chris The world is changing in some really profound ways and I worry that investors aren't paying enough attention to some of the biggest drivers of change especially when it comes to sustainability And by sustainability I mean the really juicy things like environmental and social issues and corporate governance I think it's reckless to ignore these things because doing so can jeopardize future long-term returns And here's something that may surprise you: the balance of power to really influence sustainability rests with institutional investors the large investors like pension funds foundations and endowments I believe that sustainable investing is less complicated than you think better-performing than you believe and more important than we can imagine Let me remind you what we already know We have a population that's both growing and aging; we have seven billion souls today heading to 10 billion at the end of the century; we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished; and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing Now clearly these are environmental and social issues but that's not all They're economic issues and that makes them relevant to risk and return And they are really complex and they can seem really far off that the temptation may be to do this: bury our heads in the sand and not think about it Resist this if you can Don't do this at home But it makes me wonder if the investment rules of today are fit for purpose tomorrow We know that investors when they look at a company and decide whether to invest they look at financial data metrics like sales growth cash flow market share valuation -- you know the really sexy stuff And these things are fundamental of course but they're not enough Investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call ESG: environment social and governance Environment includes energy consumption water availability waste and pollution just making efficient uses of resources Social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors But ESG is the measure of sustainability and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes So if sustainability matters financially today and all signs indicate more tomorrow is the private sector paying attention Well the really cool thing is that most CEOs are They started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success About 80 percent of global CEOs and leading to competitive advantage in their industries But 93 percent see ESG as the future or as important to the future of their business So the views of CEOs are clear There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability So how are companies actually leveraging ESG to drive hard business results One example is near and dear to our hearts In 2012 State Street migrated 54 applications to the cloud environment and we retired another 85 We virtualized our operating system environments and we completed numerous automation projects Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace and they reduce our real estate footprint and they yield savings of 23 million dollars in operating costs annually of a 100，000 metric tons of carbon That's the equivalent of taking 21，000 cars off the road Another example is Pentair Pentair is a U。S industrial conglomerate and about a decade ago they sold their core power tools business and reinvested those proceeds in a water business That's a really big bet Why did they do that Well with apologies to the Home Improvement fans there's more growth in water than in power tools and this company has their sights set on what they call the new New World That's four billion middle class people demanding food energy and water Now you may be asking yourself are these just isolated cases I mean come on really Do companies that take sustainability into account really do well financially The answer that may surprise you is yes The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance perform just as well as others In blue we see the MSCI World It's an index of large companies from developed markets across the world And in gold we see a subset of companies rated as having the best ESG performance Over three plus years no performance tradeoff So that's okay right We want more I want more In some cases there may be outperformance from ESG In blue we see the performance of the 500 largest global companies and in gold we see a subset of companies with best practice in climate change strategy and risk management Now over almost eight years they've outperformed by about two thirds So yes this is correlation It's not causation But it does illustrate that environmental leadership is compatible with good returns So if the returns are the same or better and the planet benefits wouldn't this be the norm Are investors particularly institutional investors engaged Well some are and a few are really at the vanguard Hesta Hesta is a retirement fund for health and community services employees in Australia with assets of 22 billion dollars They believe that ESG has the potential to impact risks and returns is core to their duty to act in the best interest of fund members core to their duty You gotta love the Aussies right CalPERS is another example CalPERS is the pension fund for public employees in California and with assets of 244 billion dollars they are the second largest in the U。S and the sixth largest in the world Now they're moving toward 100 percent sustainable investment by systematically integrated ESG across the entire fund Why They believe it's critical to superior long-term returns full stop In their own words long-term value creation requires the effective management of three forms of capital: financial human and physical This is why we are concerned with ESG Now I do speak to a lot of investors as part of my job and not all of them see it this way Often I hear We are required to maximize returns so we don't do that here or We don't want to use the portfolio to make policy statements The one that just really gets under my skin is If you want to do something about that just make money give the profits to charities It's eyes rolling eyes rolling I mean let me clarify something right here Companies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet They don't have indefinite social obligations and prudent investing and finance theory aren't subordinate to sustainability They're compatible So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here But institutional investors are the x-factor in sustainability Why do they hold the key The answer quite simply is they have the money A lot of it I mean a really lot of it The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars The global bond market 78 trillion That's 133 trillion combined That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U。S That's the world's largest economy That's some serious freaking firepower So we can reconsider some of these pressing challenges like fresh water clean air feeding 10 billion mouths if institutional investors integrated ESG into investment What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest or at least not exacerbating them What if we work and save and invest only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water Now a fair question might be what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated overstated it's not urgent something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice Well President John F Kennedy said something about this that is just spot on: but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus the odds that it's not completely wrong are better than the odds that our house will burn down or we'll get in a car accident Well maybe not if you live in Boston But my point is that we buy insurance to protect ourselves financially in case those things happen right So by investing sustainably we're doing two things We're creating insurance reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy and at the same time in the short term we're not sacrificing performance Man in comic: What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing Good you like it I like it too I like it because it pokes fun at both sides of the climate change issue I bet you can't guess which side I'm on But what I really like about it is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said which is Plan for the future the rest of your life Thank you I'd like to start if I may with the story of the Paisley snail On the evening of the 26th of August 1928 May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow to the town of Paisley seven miles east of the city and there at the Wellmeadow Café she had a Scots ice cream float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend The ginger beer came in a brown opaque bottle labeled D Stevenson Glen Lane Paisley She drank some of the ice cream float but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler a decomposed snail floated to the surface of her glass Three days later she was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock The case of Donoghue vs Stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent: Stevenson the manufacturer of the ginger beer was held to have a clear duty of care towards May Donoghue even though there was no contract between them and indeed she hadn't even bought the drink One of the judges Lord Atkin described it like this: You must take care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor Indeed one wonders that without a duty of care how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business because it's an important principle Last year the Hansard Society a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics published alongside their annual audit of political engagement an additional section devoted entirely to politics and the media Here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey Tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers relative even to those who read no newspapers whatsoever Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers They're not just less politically engaged They are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it Little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect the press particularly the tabloids appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view But if Hansard are right and they usually are then we've got a very serious problem on our hands and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes focusing upon Since the Paisley snail and especially over the past decade or so a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society Generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another either physically mentally or economically This is principally focused on obvious areas such as our empathetic response to children and young people to our service personnel and to the elderly and infirm It is seldom if ever extended to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government to the notion that honesty accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed participatory democracy And the more you think about it the stranger that is A couple of years ago I had the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of England It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360 As I walked through their impressive glass-covered atrium in front of me emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction: If it's not true don't say it; if it's not right don't do it The head teacher saw me staring at it and he said Oh that's our school motto On the train back to London I couldn't get it out of my mind I kept thinking can it really have taken us over 2，000 years to come to terms with that simple notion as being our minimum expectation of each other Isn't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values After all the absence of a duty of care within many professions can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence and that being the case can we be really comfortable with the thought that we're in effect being negligent in respect of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them Could anyone honestly suggest on the evidence that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen would be likely to undermine or even damage our inherently fragile democratic settlement Now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship albeit self-censorship but I don't buy that argument It has to be possible to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social responsibilities Let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker Throughout that career I never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life their own family and the future of the society in which we all live I'd go further A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit As I see it filmmakers journalists even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well-honed professional skills Obviously this is not a mandated duty but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger it strikes me as being utterly inescapable We should always remember that our notion of individual freedom and its partner creative freedom is comparatively new in the history of Western ideas and for that reason it's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined It's a prize easily lost and once lost once surrendered it can prove very very hard to reclaim And its first line of defense has to be our own standards not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation our own standards and our own integrity Our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work and our own standards as we operate within society And these standards of ours need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda They're part of a collective responsibility the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is and this in turn must go hand in hand with the responsibility of those governing society to also face up to that world and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills Yet as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media And as a consequence across the Western world the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal to a largely disillusioned older demographic along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young taken together these and other similarly contemporary aberrations are threatening to squeeze the life out of active informed debate and engagement and I stress active The most ardent of libertarians might argue that Donoghue v Stevenson should have been thrown out of court and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it But most of us I think accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care and the key word here is reasonable Judges must ask did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions Far from signifying overbearing state power it's that small common sense test of reasonableness that I'd like us to apply to those in the media who after all set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse Democracy in order to work requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult sometimes complex issues and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads to if not agreement then at least a productive and workable compromise Politics is about choices and within those choices politics is about priorities It's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever possibly based on fact But if the facts themselves are distorted the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow The media have to decide: Do they see their role as being to inflame or to inform Because in the end it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership Fifty years ago this week President John F Kennedy made two epoch-making speeches the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights The first led almost immediately to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act both of which represented giant leaps forward Democracy well-led and well-informed can achieve very great things but there's a precondition We have to trust that those making those decisions are acting in the best interest not of themselves but of the whole of the people We need factually-based options clearly laid out not those of a few powerful and potentially manipulative corporations pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas but accurate unprejudiced information with which to make our own judgments If we want to provide decent fulfilling lives for our children and our children's children we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible that duty of care for a vibrant and hopefully a lasting democracy Thank you very much for listening to me Science science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote and yet much much closer much more directly related to us there are many things we don't really understand And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us and today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity But first what do we call complexity What is complex Well complex is not complicated Something complicated comprises many small parts all different and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery On the opposite a complex system and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior which behave according to simple individual rules and this results in emergent properties cannot be predicted from the individual rules only As Aristotle wrote the whole is greater than the sum of its parts But from Aristotle let's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems These are Scottish terriers In the beginning the system is disorganized Then comes a perturbation: milk Every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction So it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges I call this simplifying complexity and it's what we do at the chair of systems design at ETH Zurich We collect data on animal populations analyze complex patterns try to explain them It requires physicists who work with biologists with mathematicians and computer scientists and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems So again the whole is greater than the sum of the parts is another example of a complex system And you may be asking yourself which side I'm on biology or physics In fact it's a little different and to explain I need to tell you a short story about myself When I was a child I loved to build stuff to create complicated machines and robotics and my end-of-studies project was about building a robot called ER-1 -- it looked like this— that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground It was very very complicated but it worked beautifully in our test room and on demo day professors had assembled to grade the project So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room It turned out the light in that room The robot's vision system got confused At the first bend in the line it left its course and crashed into a wall We had spent weeks building it and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected And I decided that in fact I didn't really want to create complicated stuff I wanted to understand complexity the complexity of the world around us and especially in the animal kingdom Which brings us to bats Bechstein's bats are a common species of European bats They are very social animals Mostly they roost or sleep together And they live in maternity colonies which means that every spring the females meet after the winter hibernation and they stay together for about six months to rear their young and they all carry a very small chip which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes we know where she is and more importantly we know with whom she is So I study roosting associations in bats and this is what it looks like During the day the bats roost in a number of sub-groups in different boxes It could be that on one day the colony is split between two boxes but on another day it could be together in a single box or split between three or more boxes and that all seems rather erratic really It's called fission-fusion dynamics the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony Okay So that's what this picture looks like In this network all the circles are nodes individual bats and the lines between them are social bonds associations between individuals It turns out this is a very interesting picture This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission-fusion dynamics We call them cryptic social units Even more interesting in fact: Every year around October the colony splits up and all bats hibernate separately but year after year when the bats come together again in the spring the communities stay the same So these bats remember their friends for a really long time With a brain the size of a peanut they maintain individualized long-term social bonds We didn't know that was possible We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that but compared to bats they have huge brains So how could it be that the bats maintain this complex stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities And this is where complexity brings an answer To understand this system we built a computer model of roosting based on simple individual rules and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony It's a mathematical model but it's not complicated What the model told us is that in a nutshell each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them Simple individual rules This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats But it gets better Between 2010 and 2011 the colony lost more than two thirds of its members probably due to the very cold winter The next spring it didn't form two communities like every year which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small Instead it formed a single cohesive social unit which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this All they do is follow simple association rules emerges social complexity against dramatic changes in the population structure And I find this incredible Now I want to tell you another story but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa This is where meerkats live I'm sure you know meerkats They're fascinating creatures They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy There is one dominant pair and many subordinates some acting as sentinels some acting as babysitters some teaching pups and so on What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats In the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road On this road there are cars so it's dangerous But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another So we asked how exactly do they do this We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road she gives way to the subordinates a manner of saying Go ahead tell me if it's safe What I didn't know in fact was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it So I built a model a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road It's a simplistic model Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment They simply move together When these particles get to the road they sense some kind of obstacle and they bounce against it The only difference between the dominant female here in red and the other individuals is that for her the height of the obstacle which is in fact the risk perceived from the road is just slightly higher and this tiny difference in the individual's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first George Box who was an English statistician once wrote All models are false but some models are useful And in fact this model is obviously false because in reality meerkats are anything but random particles But it's also useful because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group So again that's simplifying complexity I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate it's not out of courtesy In fact the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group If she dies on the road the whole group is at risk So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old in this case a road built by humans They adapt very simple rules and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat In the end it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road or it may be another species My message here -- and it's not a complicated one but a simple one of wonder and hope -- my message here is that animals show extraordinary social complexity and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment In three words in the animal kingdom simplicity leads to complexity which leads to resilience Thank you Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much Nicolas for this great start Little bit nervous Nicolas Perony: I'm okay thanks Okay great I'm sure a lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about -- You brought some examples: The females are the social ones the females are the dominant ones I'm not sure who thinks how But is it okay to do these associations Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species NP: Well I would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes For examples in sea horses or in koalas in fact And the lesson is that it's often difficult and sometimes even a bit dangerous to draw parallels between humans and animals So that's it Okay Thank you very much for this great start Thank you Nicolas Perony I'd like to reimagine education The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word It starts with an M MOOC: massive open online courses Many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world in the millions for free Anybody who has an Internet connection and the will to learn can access these great courses from excellent universities and get a credential at the end of it Now in this discussion today I'm going to focus on a different aspect of MOOCs We are taking what we are learning and the technologies we are developing in the large and applying them in the small to create a blended model of education to really reinvent and reimagine what we do in the classroom Now our classrooms could use change So here's a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the Northeast of America MIT And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago and this is a classroom today What's changed The seats are in color Whoop-de-do Education really hasn't changed in the past 500 years The last big innovation in education was the printing press and the textbooks Everything else has changed around us You know from healthcare to transportation everything is different but education hasn't changed It's also been a real issue in terms of access So what you see here is not a rock concert And the person you see at the end of the stage is not Madonna This is a classroom at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria Now we've all heard of distance education but the students way in the back 200 feet away from the instructor I think they are undergoing long-distance education Now I really believe that we can transform education both in quality and scale and access through technology For example at edX we are trying to transform education through online technologies Given education has been calcified for 500 years we really cannot think about reengineering it micromanaging it We really have to completely reimagine it It's like going from ox carts to the airplane Even the infrastructure has to change Everything has to change We need to go from lectures on the blackboard to online exercises online videos We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification We have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards Everything really has to change So at edX and a number of other organizations we are applying these technologies to education through MOOCs to really increase access to education And you heard of this example where when we launched our very first course -- and this was an MIT-hard circuits and electronics course -- about a year and a half ago 155，000 students from 162 countries enrolled in this course And we had no marketing budget Now 155，000 is a big number This number is bigger than the total number of alumni of MIT in its 150-year history 7，200 students passed the course and this was a hard course 7，200 is also a big number If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year I would have to teach for 40 years before I could teach this many students Now these large numbers are just one part of the story So today I want to discuss a different aspect the other side of MOOCs take a different perspective We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom to create a blended model of learning But before I go into that let me tell you a story When my daughter turned 13 became a teenager she stopped speaking English and she began speaking this new language I call it teen-lish It's a digital language It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence Honey come over for dinner Hmm Did you hear me Silence Can you listen to me &amp;quot;Hmm。&amp;quot; So we had a real issue with communicating and we were just not communicating until one day I had this epiphany I texted her I got an instant response I said no that must have been by accident She must have thought you know some friend of hers was calling her So I texted her again Boom another response I said this is great And so since then our life has changed I text her she responds It's just been absolutely great So our millennial generation is built differently Now I'm older and my youthful looks might belie that but I'm not in the millennial generation But our kids are really different The millennial generation is completely comfortable with online technology So why are we fighting it in the classroom Let's not fight it Let's embrace it In fact I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs I can't text very well -- but I'm willing to bet that with evolution our kids and their grandchildren will develop really really little itty-bitty thumbs to text much better that evolution will fix all of that stuff But what if we embraced technology embraced the millennial generation's natural predilections and really think about creating these online technologies blend them into their lives So here's what we can do So rather than driving our kids into a classroom herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning -- I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning so why are we forcing our kids to do that So instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms in their bedroom in the dining room in the bathroom wherever they're most creative Then they come into the classroom for some in-person interaction They can have discussions amongst themselves They can solve problems together They can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions In fact with edX when we were teaching our first course on circuits and electronics around the world this was happening unbeknownst to us Two high school teachers at the Sant High School in Mongolia had flipped their classroom and they were using our video lectures and interactive exercises where the learners in the high school 15-year-olds mind you would go and do these things in their own homes and they would come into class and as you see from this image here they would interact with each other and do some physical laboratory work And the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog We were also doing other pilots So we did a pilot experimental blended courses working with San Jose State University in California again with the circuits and electronics course You'll hear that a lot That course has become sort of like our petri dish of learning So there the students would again the instructors flipped the classroom blended online and in person and the results were staggering Now don't take these results to the bank just yet Just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more but the early results are incredible So traditionally semester upon semester for the past several years this course again a hard course had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent every semester With this blended class late last year the failure rate fell to nine percent So the results can be extremely extremely good Now before we go too far into this I'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas What are some key ideas that makes all of this work One idea is active learning The idea here is rather than have students walk into class and watch lectures we replace this with what we call lessons Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises So a student might watch a five- seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise Think of this as the ultimate Socratization of education You teach by asking questions And this is a form of learning called active learning and really promoted by a very early paper in 1972 by Craik and Lockhart where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing Students learn much better when they are interacting with the material The second idea is self-pacing Now when I went to a lecture hall and if you were like me by the fifth minute I would lose the professor I wasn't all that smart and I would be scrambling taking notes and then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour Instead wouldn't it be nice with online technologies we offer videos and interactive engagements to students They can hit the pause button They can rewind the professor Heck they can even mute the professor So this form of self-pacing can be very helpful to learning The third idea that we have is instant feedback With instant feedback the computer grades exercises I mean how else do you teach 150，000 students Your computer is grading all the exercises And we've all submitted homeworks and your grades come back two weeks later you've forgotten all about it I don't think I've still received some of my homeworks from my undergraduate days Some are never graded So with instant feedback students can try to apply answers If they get it wrong they can get instant feedback They can try it again and try it again and this really becomes much more engaging They get the instant feedback and this little green check mark that you see here is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark In fact one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year he then went on to take a software course from Berkeley at the end of the year and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark: &amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you。&amp;quot; When's the last time you've seen students posting comments like this about homework My colleague Ed Bertschinger who heads up the physics department at MIT has this to say about instant feedback: He indicated that instant feedback turns teaching moments into learning outcomes The next big idea is gamification You know all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on You know they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it So we applied these gamification techniques to learning and we can build these online laboratories How do you teach creativity How do you teach design We can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs So as this little video shows here you can engage students much like they design with Legos So here the learners are building a circuit with Lego-like ease And this can also be graded by the computer Fifth is peer learning So here we use discussion forums and discussions and Facebook-like interaction not as a distraction but to really help students learn Let me tell you a story When we did our circuits course for the 155，000 students I didn't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course I told my TAs okay 24/7 we're going to be up monitoring the forum answering questions They had answered questions for 100 students How do you do that for 150，000 So one night I'm sitting up there at 2 a。m at night and I think there's this question from a student from Pakistan and he asked a question and I said okay let me go and type up an answer I don't type all that fast and I begin typing up the answer and before I can finish another student from Egypt popped in with an answer not quite right so I'm fixing the answer and before I can finish a student from the U。S had popped in with a different answer And then I sat back fascinated Boom boom boom boom the students were discussing and interacting with each other and by 4 a。m that night I'm totally fascinated having this epiphany and by 4 a。m in the morning they had discovered the right answer And all I had to do was go and bless it Good answer So this is absolutely amazing where students are learning from each other and they're telling us that they are learning by teaching Now this is all not just in the future This is happening today So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- all over the world And these kinds of technologies really help the blended model can really help revolutionize education It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs the business aspect We can also license these MOOC courses to other universities and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs where the university that licenses it with the professor can use these online courses like the next-generation textbook They can use as much or as little as they like and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal Finally I would like to have you dream with me for a little bit I would like us to really reimagine education We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces We have to move from books to tablets like the Aakash in India or the Raspberry Pi 20 dollars The Aakash is 40 dollars We have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories But I think at the end of the day I think we will still need one lecture hall in our universities Otherwise how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and you know you didn't even have a rewind button Thank you Thank you Thank you I have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas: Why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where I work I have worked with more than 500 companies Despite all the technological advances -- computers I。T。 communications telecommunications the Internet Enigma number two: Why is there so little engagement at work Why do people feel so miserable even actively disengaged Disengaging their colleagues Despite all the affiliation events the celebration the people initiatives the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams At the beginning I thought there was a chicken and egg issue: Because people are less engaged they are less productive Or vice versa because they are less productive we put more pressure and they are less engaged But as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates in fact to the basic pillars of management The way we organize is based on two pillars The hard -- structure processes systems The soft -- feelings sentiments interpersonal relationships traits personality And whenever a company goes through a cultural transformation program it chooses these two pillars Now we try to refine them we try to combine them The real issue is -- and this is the answer to the two enigmas -- these pillars are obsolete Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination They are obsolete How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business The hard approach basically is that you start from strategy requirements structures processes systems KPIs scorecards committees headquarters hubs clusters you name it I forgot all the metrics incentives committees middle offices and interfaces What happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business We need quality cost reliability speed And every time there is a new requirement we use the same approach We create dedicated structure processed systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization Let's take an example An automotive company the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix If you open any cell of the matrix you find another 20-dimensional matrix You have Mr Noise Mr Petrol Consumption Mr Anti-Collision Properties For any new requirement you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement What happens when the new requirement emerges Some years ago a new requirement appeared on the marketplace: the length of the warranty period making cars easy to repair Otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light if you have to remove the engine to access the lights the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours and the warranty budget will explode So what was the solution using the hard approach If repairability is the new requirement the solution is to create a new function Mr Repairability And Mr Repairability creates the repairability process With a repairability scorecard with a repairability metric and eventually repairability incentive What percentage of these people is variable compensation Twenty percent at most divided by 26 KPIs repairability makes a difference of 0。8 percent What difference did it make in their actions their choices to simplify Zero But what occurs for zero impact Mr Repairability process scorecard evaluation coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact Now in front of the new complexity of business the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines It is basically the interplay How the parts work together The connections the interactions the synapses It is not the skeleton of boxes it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence You know you could call it cooperation basically Whenever people cooperate they use less resources In everything You know the repairability issue is a cooperation problem When you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages When we don't cooperate we need more time more equipment more systems more teams We need -- When procurement supply chain manufacturing don't cooperate we need more stock more inventories more working capital Who will pay for that Shareholders Customers No they will refuse So who is left The employees who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation Stress burnout they are overwhelmed accidents No wonder they disengage How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation The hard: In banks when there is a problem between the back office and the front office they don't cooperate What is the solution They create a middle office What happens one year later Instead of one problem between the back and the front now I have two problems Between the back and the middle and between the middle and the front Plus I have to pay for the middle office The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation It can only add new boxes new bones in the skeleton The soft approach: To make people cooperate we need to make them like each other Improve interpersonal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate It is totally wrong It is even counterproductive Look at home I have two TVs Why Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because I love my wife If I didn't love my wife one TV would be enough: You will watch my favorite football game if you are not happy how is the book or the door The more we like each other the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration Definitely these approaches are obsolete To deal with complexity to enhance the nervous system we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules Simple rule number one: Understand what others do What is their real work We need to go beyond the boxes the job descriptions beyond the surface of the container to understand the real content Me designer if I put a wire here I know that it will mean that we will have to remove the engine to access the lights Second you need to reenforce integrators Integrators are not middle offices they are managers existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate How can you reinforce your managers as integrators By removing layers When there are too many layers people are too far from the action therefore they need KPIs metrics they need poor proxies for reality They don't understand reality and they add the complicatedness of metrics KPIs By removing rules -- the bigger we are the more we need integrators therefore the less rules we must have to give discretionary power to managers And we do the opposite -- the bigger we are the more rules we create And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules You need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment their intelligence You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate to move out of insulation Otherwise they will withdraw They will disengage These rules they come from game theory and organizational sociology You can increase the shadow of the future Create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr Repairability had no impact They said to the design engineers: Now in three years when the new car is launched on the market you will move to the after sales network and become in charge of the warranty budget and if the warranty budget explodes it will explode in your face Much more powerful than 0。8 percent variable compensation You need also to increase reciprocity by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient When you remove these buffers you hold me by the nose I hold you by the ear We will cooperate Remove the second TV There are many second TVs at work that don't create value they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate The CEO of The Lego Group He says blame is not for failure it is for failing to help or ask for help It changes everything Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses my real forecast because I know I will not be blamed if I fail but if I fail to help or ask for help When you do this it has a lot of implications on organizational design You stop drawing boxes dotted lines full lines; you look at their interplay It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use On human resource management practices When you do that you can manage complexity the new complexity of business without getting complicated You create more value with lower cost You simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both Complicatedness: This is your battle business leaders The real battle is not against competitors This is rubbish very abstract When do we meet competitors to fight them The real battle is against ourselves against our bureaucracy our complicatedness Only you can fight can do it Thank you So when I was in Morocco in Casablanca not so long ago Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception pregnancy and delivery It was a remarkable tale but Faiza saved the best for last You know I am a virgin she told me I have two medical certificates to prove it This is the modern Middle East where two millennia after the coming of Christ virgin births are still a fact of life Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard over the years traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex Now I know this might sound like a dream job or possibly a highly dubious occupation but for me it's something else altogether I'm half Egyptian and I'm Muslim But I grew up in Canada far from my Arab roots Like so many who straddle East and West I've been drawn over the years to try to better understand my origins That I chose to look at sex comes from my background in HIV/AIDS as a writer and a researcher and an activist Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa which is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage: in politics and economics in religion and tradition in gender and generations As I found if you really want to know a people you start by looking inside their bedrooms Now to be sure the Arab world is vast and varied But running across it are three red lines -- these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed The first of these is politics But the Arab Spring has changed all that in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since 2011 Now while those in power old and new continue to cling to business as usual millions are still pushing back and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life That second red line is religion But now religion and politics are connected with the rise of such groups as the Muslim Brotherhood And some people at least are starting to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life You know as for that third red line that off-limits subject what do you think it might be Audience: Sex Shereen El Feki: Louder I can't hear you Audience: Sex SEF: Again please don't be shy Audience: Sex SEF: Absolutely that's right it's sex Across the Arab region the only accepted context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents sanctioned by religion and registered by the state Marriage is your ticket to adulthood If you don't tie the knot you can't move out of your parents' place and you're not supposed to be having sex and you're definitely not supposed to be having children It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault any alternative And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex against condoms against abortion against homosexuality you name it Faiza was living proof of this Her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking Although the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity in a patriarchy boys will be boys Men have sex before marriage and people more or less turn a blind eye Not so for women who are expected to be virgins on their wedding night -- that is to turn up with your hymen intact This is not a question of individual concern this is a matter of family honor and in particular men's honor And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve this tiny piece of anatomy -- from female genital mutilation to virginity testing to hymen repair surgery Faiza chose a different route: non-vaginal sex Only she became pregnant all the same But Faiza didn't actually realize this because there's so little sexuality education in schools and so little communication in the family When her condition became hard to hide Faiza's mother helped her flee her father and brothers This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in Casablanca the man who offered to help her instead tried to rape her Sadly Faiza is not alone In Egypt where my research is focused I have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married because marriage has become a very expensive proposition They are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life but they can't find jobs This is one of the major drivers of the recent uprisings and it is one of the reasons for the rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region There are career women who want to get married but can't find a husband because they defy gender expectations or as one young female doctor in Tunisia put it to me The women they are becoming more and more open But the man he is still at the prehistoric stage And then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line who have sex with their own sex or who have a different gender identity They are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities even their appearance And they face a daily struggle with social stigma with family despair and with religious fire and brimstone Now it's not as if it's all rosy in the marital bed either Couples who are looking for greater happiness greater sexual happiness in their married lives but are at a loss of how to achieve it especially wives who are afraid of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution They have been sold by their families often to wealthy Arab tourists This is just one face of a booming sex trade across the Arab region Now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you from your part of the world Yeah It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups And although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening inside bedrooms across the Arab region It's pretty clear that something is not right Double standards for men and women sex as a source of shame family control limiting individual choices and a vast gulf between appearance and reality: what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me Here sex is the opposite of sport Football everybody talks about it but hardly anyone plays But sex everybody is doing it but nobody wants to talk about it SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice which if you follow it will make you happy in life When your husband reaches out to you when he seizes a part of your body sigh deeply and look at him lustily When he penetrates you with his penis try to talk flirtatiously and move yourself in harmony with him Hot stuff And it might sound that these handy hints come from The Joy of Sex or YouPorn But in fact they come from a 10th-century Arabic book called The Encyclopedia of Pleasure which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia and everything in between The Encyclopedia is just one in a long line of Arabic erotica much of it written by religious scholars Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex: not just its problems but also its pleasures and not just for men but also for women A thousand years ago we used to have whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature position and preference a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body of the woman you see on this page Today this history is largely unknown in the Arab region Even by educated people who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution But while the West has opened on sex what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction In Egypt and many of its neighbors this closing down is part of a wider closing in political social and cultural thought And it is the product of a complex historical process one which has gained ground with the rise of Islamic conservatism since the late 1970s Just say no is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo In the Arab region they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control: sex wrapped up in religion But history shows us that even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day there have been times of greater pragmatism and tolerance and a willingness to consider other interpretations: be it abortion or masturbation or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality It is not black and white as conservatives would have us believe In these as in so many other matters Over my travels I've met men and women across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum -- sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages innovators who are managing to get sexuality education into schools small groups of men and women lesbian gay transgendered transsexual who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support Women and increasingly men who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home Groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society and critically stay with their kids Now these efforts are small they're often underfunded and they face formidable opposition But I am optimistic that in the long run times are changing and they and their ideas will gain ground Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation beating or indeed baring of breasts but rather through negotiation What we're talking here is not about a sexual revolution but a sexual evolution learning from other parts of the world adapting to local conditions forging our own path not following one blazed by another That path I hope will one day lead us to the right to control our own bodies and to access the information and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives The right to express our ideas freely to marry whom we choose to choose our own partners to be sexually active or not to decide whether to have children and when all this without violence or force or discrimination Now we are very far from this across the Arab region and so much needs to change: law education media the economy the list goes on and on and it is the work of a generation at least But it begins with a journey that I myself have made asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life And it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities where I once only saw absolutes Now given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region talking about sex challenging the taboos seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury But at this critical moment in history if we do not anchor freedom and justice dignity and equality privacy and autonomy in our personal lives in our sexual lives we will find it very hard to achieve in public life The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows and that is true for us all no matter where we live and love Thank you I have a question: Who here remembers when they first realized they were going to die I do I was a young boy and my grandfather had just died and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened What did it mean that he was dead Where had he gone It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die could it happen to me too Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept Well at some point all children become aware of death It can happen in different ways of course and usually comes in stages Our idea of death develops as we grow older And if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory you might remember something like what I felt when my grandfather died and when I realized it could happen to me too that sense that behind all of this the void is waiting And this development in childhood reflects the development of our species Just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were mortal so at some point in the evolution of our species some early human's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize I'm going to die This is if you like our curse It's the price we pay for being so damn clever We have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will the end of all our projects our hopes our dreams of our individual world We each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse And that's frightening It's terrifying And so we look for a way out And in my case as I was about five years old this meant asking my mum Now when I first started asking what happens when we die the grown-ups around me at the time answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness and half-hearted Christianity and the phrase I heard most often was that granddad was now up there looking down on us and if I should die too which wouldn't happen of course then I too would go up there which made death sound a lot like an existential elevator Now this didn't sound very plausible I used to watch a children's news program at the time and this was the era of space exploration There were always rockets going up into the sky up into space going up there But none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people But I was scared and the idea of taking the existential elevator to see my granddad sounded a lot better than being swallowed by the void while I slept And so I believed it anyway even though it didn't make much sense And this thought process that I went through as a child and have been through many times since including as a grown-up is a product of what psychologists call a bias Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong ways in which we miscalculate misjudge distort reality or see what we want to see and the bias I'm talking about works like this: Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can instead live forever even if it means taking the existential elevator Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies Now these studies are ingenious but they're simple They work like this You take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects and you remind one group that they're going to die but not the other then you compare their behavior So you're observing how it biases behavior when people become aware of their mortality And every time you get the same result: People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever So here's an example: One recent study took two groups of agnostics that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs Now one group was asked to think about being dead being lonely They were then asked again about their religious beliefs Those who had been asked to think about being dead were afterwards twice as likely to express faith in God and Jesus Twice as likely Even though the before they were all equally agnostic But put the fear of death in them and they run to Jesus Now this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe regardless of the evidence and it works not just for religion but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form whether it's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole This is a bias that has shaped the course of human history Now the theory behind this bias in the over 400 studies is called terror management theory and the idea is simple It's just this We develop our worldviews that is the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it in order to help us manage the terror of death And these immortality stories have thousands of different manifestations but I believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take And we can see them repeating themselves throughout history just with slight variations to reflect the vocabulary of the day Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four basic forms of immortality story and I want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they're retold by each culture or generation using the vocabulary of their day Now the first story is the simplest We want to avoid death and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story and it might at first sound implausible but actually almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever Ancient Egypt had such myths ancient Babylon ancient India Throughout European history we find them in the work of the alchemists and of course we still believe this today only we tell this story using the vocabulary of science So 100 years ago hormones had just been discovered and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells genetic engineering and nanotechnology But the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir a story that is as old as civilization But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past the one thing they now have in common is that they're all dead So we need a backup plan and exactly this kind of plan B is what the second kind of immortality story offers and that's resurrection And it stays with the idea that I am this body I am this physical organism It accepts that I'm going to have to die but says despite that I can rise up and I can live again In other words I can do what Jesus did Jesus died he was three days in the tomb and then he rose up and lived again And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age for example with the idea of cryonics That's the idea that when you die you can have yourself frozen and then at some point when technology has advanced enough you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected And so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it But for others the whole idea of resurrection of climbing out of the grave it's just too much like a bad zombie movie They find the body too messy too unreliable to guarantee eternal life and so they set their hopes on the third more spiritual immortality story the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul Now the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul and the idea is central to many religions But even though in its current form in its traditional form the idea of the soul is still hugely popular nonetheless we are again reinventing it for the digital age for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind your essence the real you onto a computer and so live on as an avatar in the ether But of course there are skeptics who say if we look at the evidence of science particularly neuroscience it suggests that your mind your essence the real you is very much dependent on a particular part of your body that is your brain And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story and that is legacy the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world like the great Greek warrior Achilles who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame And the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was and in our digital age it's even easier to achieve You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles or a great king or hero All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat But some people prefer to leave a more tangible biological legacy -- children for example Or they like they hope to live on as part of some greater whole a nation or a family or a tribe their gene pool But again there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality Woody Allen for example who said I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen I want to live on in my apartment So those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories and I've tried to give just some sense of how they're retold by each generation with just slight variations to fit the fashions of the day And the fact that they recur in this way in such a similar form but in such different belief systems suggests I think that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories The fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this on the strength of the evidence Rather we believe these stories because we are biased to believe them and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death So the question is are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial or can we overcome this bias Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus thought we could He argued that the fear of death is natural but it is not rational Death he said is nothing to us because when we are here death is not and when death is here we are gone Now this is often quoted but it's difficult to really grasp to really internalize because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine So 2，000 years later another philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein put it like this: Death is not an event in life: We do not live to experience death And so he added in this sense life has no end So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void but it wasn't rational because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience Now overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives Now I find it helps to see life as being like a book: Just as a book is bounded by its covers by beginning and end so our lives are bounded by birth and death and even though a book is limited by beginning and end it can encompass distant landscapes exotic figures fantastic adventures And even though a book is limited by beginning and end the characters within it know no horizons They only know the moments that make up their story even when the book is closed And so the characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page Long John Silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of Treasure Island And so it should be with us Imagine the book of your life its covers its beginning and end and your birth and your death You can only know the moments in between the moments that make up your life It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers whether before your birth or after your death And you needn't worry how long the book is or whether it's a comic strip or an epic The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story Thank you So how many of you have ever been in a cave before Okay a few of you When you think of a cave most of you think of a tunnel going through solid rock and in fact that's how most caves are Around this half of the country most of your caves are made of limestone Back where I'm from most of our caves are made of lava rock because we have a lot of volcanoes out there But the caves I want to share with you today are made completely of ice specifically glacier ice that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain in the state of Oregon called Mount Hood Now Mount Hood's only one hour's drive from Portland the largest city in Oregon where over two million people live Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to find a new cave and be the first human to ever go into it The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave Now these days with so many people hiking around it's pretty hard to find a new cave so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before It was kind of like being an astronaut because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before So what is a glacier Well those of you who have ever seen or touched snow you know that it's really light because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together and it's mostly air If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball it gets really small hard and dense Well on a mountain like Hood where it snows over 20 feet a year it crushes the air out of it and gradually forms it into hard blue ice Now each year more and more ice stacks up on top of it and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight forming a slow-moving river of ice When ice packed like that starts to move we call it a glacier and we give it a name The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier Now each year as new snow lands on the glacier it melts in the summer sun and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier forming big networks of caves sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock Now the crazy thing about glacier caves is that each year new tunnels form Different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave Warm water from the top of the ice is boring its way down and warm air from below the mountain actually rises up gets into the cave and melts the ceilings back taller and taller But the weirdest thing about glacier caves is that the entire cave is moving because it's formed inside a block of ice the size of a small city that's slowly sliding down the mountain Now this is Brent McGregor my cave exploration partner He and I have both been exploring caves a long time and we've been climbing mountains a long time but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before Back in 2011 Brent saw a YouTube video of a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves There were no GPS coordinates for it and all we knew was that it was somewhere out on the Sandy Glacier So in July of that year we went out on the glacier and we found a big crack in the ice We had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole This is me looking into the entrance crevasse At the end of this hole we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice We followed this cave back for about a half mile until it came to an end and then with the help of our survey tools we made a three-dimensional map of the cave on our way back out So how do you map a cave Well cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps because they have pits and holes going to overlapping levels To make a cave map you have to set up survey stations every few feet inside the cave and you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be So when you're done surveying you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage kind of like an ant farm view We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow Now later this summer as more snow melted off the glacier we found more caves and we realized they were all connected Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon Brent discovered this new cave not very far away The inside of it was coated with ice so we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons so we could walk around without slipping This cave was amazing The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green because the sunlight from far above was shining through the ice and lighting it all up And we couldn't understand why this cave was so much colder than Snow Dragon until we got to the end and we found out why There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin going 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier Cold air from the top of the mountain was flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave freezing everything inside of it And we were so excited about finding this new pit we actually came back in January the following year so we could be the first ones to explore it It was so cold outside we actually had to sleep inside the cave There's our camp on the left side of this entrance room The next morning we climbed out of the cave and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit for the very first time Brent named this cave Pure Imagination I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined So besides really cool ice what else is inside these caves and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the year But there are some really cool things in there There's weird bacteria living in the water that actually eat and digest rocks to make their own food to live under this ice In fact this past summer scientists collected samples of water and ice specifically to see if things called extremophiles tiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions might be living under the ice Another really cool things is that as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier sinking deeper and deeper into the ice As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor where we end up finding them For example this is a noble fir seed we found It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years and it's just now starting to sprout This mallard duck feather was found over 1，800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave This duck died on the surface of the glacier long long ago and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave And this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of Snow Dragon Even now Brent and I find it hard to believe that all these discoveries were essentially in our own backyard hidden away just waiting to be found Like I said earlier the idea of discovering in this busy world we live in kind of seems like something you can only do with space travel now but that's not true Every year new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before So it's actually not too late for one of you to become a discoverer yourself You just have to be willing to look and go where people don't often go and focus your eyes and your mind to recognize the discovery when you see it because it might be in your own backyard Thank you very much I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart and so just before I get going I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom And so this talk is going to be for him I grew up in wonder I grew up amongst those animals I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations Now for as long as I can remember my job has been to take people out into nature and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories stories about heroes of heart Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place I also know it to be a place where people animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world When I was nine years old President Mandela came to stay with my family He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi But it was a defining time for me as a young boy I would take him breakfast in bed and then in an old track suit and slippers he would go for a walk around the garden At night I would sit with my family around the snowy bunny-eared TV and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa: peace reconciliation harmony Through this act of immense open-heartedness he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call ubuntu Ubuntu: I am because of you Or people are not people without other people It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on In fact it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others Ubuntu is at play right now You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am Without you I'm just a guy talking to an empty room and I spent a lot of time last week doing that If Mandela was the national and international embodiment then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man Solly Mhlongo Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique He would never have a lot of money but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle Now I can tell you I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle but it makes for über-resourcefulness The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea but he could do it He then moved across into what we called the habitat team These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being He fixed roads he mended wetlands he did some anti-poaching And then one day we were out together and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked And it was an old track but for fun he turned and he began to follow it and I tell you I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph。D。-level tracker If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve you look up in your rearview mirror you'd see he'd stopped the car 20 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him Solly you are pathologically helpful When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment Solly was my tracker We worked together as a team And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast and they said to Solly on the side they said Before we even go out to see lions and leopards we want to see where you live So we took them up to his house and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife who was learning English was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying Hello I love you Welcome I love you And there was something so beautifully African about it to me this small house with a huge heart in it Now on the day that Solly saved my life he was already my hero It was a hot day and we found ourselves down by the river Because of the heat I took my shoes off and I rolled up my pants and I walked into the water Solly remained on the bank The water was clear running over sand and we turned and we began to make our way upstream And a few meters ahead of us there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank and its branches were touching the water and it was shadowy And if had been a horror movie people in the audience would have started saying Don't go in there Don't go in there And of course the crocodile was in the shadows Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite Wham It hits me by my right leg It pulls me It turns I throw my hand up I'm able to grab a branch It's shaking me violently It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble He turns He begins to make his way to me The croc again continues to shake me It goes to bite me a second time I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream As it bites the second time I kick My foot goes down its throat It spits me out I pull myself up into the branches and as I come out of the water I look over my shoulder My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description The bone is cracked The meat is torn up I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again As I come out of the water Solly arrives at a deep section a channel between us He knows he sees the state of my leg he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second He comes straight into the channel He wades in to above his waist He gets to me He grabs me I'm still in a vulnerable position He picks me and puts me on his shoulder This is the other thing about Solly he's freakishly strong He turns He walks me up the bank He lays me down He pulls his shirt off He wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and he's able to get me to medical attention And I survive Now Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you but for Solly it was as natural as breathing And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa In a more collective society we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others Danger is shared Pain is shared Joy is shared Achievement is shared Houses are shared Food is shared Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value his animated empathetic action in every moment Now although the root word is about people I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people And then I met this young lady Her name was Elvis In fact Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route When I first saw her I thought she would be dead in a matter of days And yet for the next five years she returned in the winter months And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track It looked like an inverted bracket and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow and then we would come around the corner and there she would be with her herd And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her it was this sense of kinship And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving And then one day we came across them at this small water hole It was sort of a hollow in the ground And I watched as the matriarch drank and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants looks like the arm in motion and she began to make her way up the steep bank The rest of the herd turned and began to follow And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill She got visibly -- ears came forward she had a full go of it and halfway up her legs gave way and she fell backwards She attempted it a second time and again halfway up she fell backwards And on the third attempt an amazing thing happened Halfway up the bank a young teenage elephant came in behind her and he propped his trunk underneath her and he began to shovel her up the bank And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet If Africa has a gift to share it's a gift of a more collective society what I see is the essence of that value being invented here Thank you Pat Mitchell: So Boyd we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session Boyd Varty: Well thanks Pat I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on He was suffering And so of course there's the mixed emotions But I just think of so many occurrences And she was like Well it'll be about you I mean that's just incredible humility He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa And everything they used to call it Madiba magic You know he used to go to a rugby match and we would win Anywhere he went things went well But I think that magic will be with us and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for And so that's what I'm going to try and do and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do PM: And that's what you've done today BV: Oh thank you PM: Thank you BV: Thank you Thanks very much Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge because different from health or education or housing it tends to get worse as societies become richer Clearly a unsustainable model Mobility as most other developing country problems more than a matter of money or technology is a matter of equality equity The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see for example that in terms of transport an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars but rather one where even the rich use public transport Or bicycles: For example in Amsterdam more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States There is a conflict in developing world cities for money for government investment If more money is invested in highways of course there is less money for housing for schools for hospitals and also there is a conflict for space There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources However there is a problem with that that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work Some people must make more money some others less Some companies succeed Others fail Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities The first one is equality of quality of life especially for children that all children should have beyond the obvious health and education access to green spaces to sports facilities to swimming pools to music lessons And the second kind of equality is one which we could call democratic equality The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law That is not just poetry It's a very powerful principle For example if that is true a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one We have been so used to inequality sometimes that it's before our noses and we do not see it Less than 100 years ago women could not vote and it seemed normal in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic In fact when I became mayor applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest that a bus with 100 people has a right to 100 times more road space than a car we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes We called it TransMilenio in order to make buses sexier And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol because as buses zoom by expensive cars stuck in traffic it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work In fact it's not just a matter of equity It doesn't take Ph。D。's A committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses In fact buses are not sexy but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities They also have great capacity For example this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China except for one line in Beijing at a fraction of the cost We fought not just for space for buses but we fought for space for people and that was even more difficult Cities are human habitats and we humans are pedestrians Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run we need to walk There is a really enormous conflict when we are talking about developing country cities between pedestrians and cars Here what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy What this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens In terms of transport infrastructure what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks Here they made a flyover probably very useless and they forgot to make a sidewalk This is prevailing all over the world Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars In my city of Bogotá we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars which had been parking on sidewalks for decades in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings and to make space for protected bikeways First of all I had black hair before that And I was almost impeached in the process It is a very difficult battle However it was possible finally after very difficult battles to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars Indeed a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city which is road space A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space How to distribute it between pedestrians bicycles public transport and cars This is not a technological issue and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution We also built and this was 15 years ago before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London it was a very difficult battle as well more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature They are a right just as sidewalks are unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility without the risk of getting killed And just as busways are protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important to one in a $30，000 car And we are living in a unique moment in history In the next 50 years more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built In many developing country cities more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades But this is not just a matter for developing country cities In the United States for example more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain France and Canada put together And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws and that different better ones could be built What is wrong with our cities today Well for example if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today Watch out a car the child will jump in fright and with a very good reason because there are more than 10，000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world We have had cities for 8，000 years and children could walk out of home and play In fact only very recently towards 1900 there were no cars Cars have been here for really less than 100 years They completely changed cities In 1900 for example nobody was killed by cars in the United States Only 20 years later between 1920 and 1930 almost 200，000 people were killed by cars in the United States Only in 1925 almost 7，000 children were killed by cars in the United States So we could make different cities cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars that will give more public space to human beings than to cars cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens such as children or the elderly I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss-crossing cities in all directions Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways sort of bicycle highways and I would invite you to imagine the following: a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles In new cities which are going to be built this would not be particularly difficult When I was mayor of Bogotá in only three years we were able to create 70 kilometers in one of the most dense cities in the world of these bicycle highways And this changes the way people live move enjoy the city In this picture you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street and the cars still in the mud Of course I would love to pave this street for cars But what do we do first Ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars But you see when a city is only being created it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure Then the city grows around it And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it and it changes the way of life And the second ingredient which would solve mobility that very difficult challenge in developing countries in a very low-cost and simple way would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses buses and bicycles and pedestrians This would be again a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start low cost pleasant transit with natural sunlight But unfortunately reality is not as good as my dreams Because of private property of land and high land prices all developing country cities have a large problem of slums In my country of Colombia almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low-cost high-frequency public transport As a Latin American and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world I would recommend respectfully passionately to those countries which are yet to urbanize -- Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 -- I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize such as India which is only 33 percent urban now that governments should acquire all land around cities In this way their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces with the parks with the greenways with the busways The cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come especially in the developing countries They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future I am sure I am optimistic that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams Technology can change our understanding of nature Take for example the case of lions For centuries it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner You've heard this too I can tell Well recently I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be They just use a different strategy Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances usually during the day male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation and often at night This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation and the white are wide open spaces And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions All of a sudden you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting I bring up this example to begin because it emphasizes how little we know about nature There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate as shown in red on the slide I find it ironic that we're doing so much yet these areas are fairly unknown to science So how can we save what we don't understand Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects but above all I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet So I created this the Carnegie Airborne Observatory or CAO but I packed it with over 1，000 kilos of high-tech sensors computers and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots Two of our instruments are very unique: one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them Another one is a set of lasers very high-powered lasers that fire out of the bottom of the plane sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly 500，000 times per second in high-resolution 3D Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco not far from where I live Although we flew straight over this bridge we imaged it in 3D captured its color in just a few seconds But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems This is a small town in the Amazon imaged with the CAO We can slice through our data and see for example the 3D structure of the vegetation and the buildings or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon This is how we see a rainforest in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them So our imagery is 3D it's chemical it's biological and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point such as from the ground or from satellite sensors I want to share three of those questions with you today The first questions is how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming Unfortunately global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector That's all ships airplanes trains and automobiles combined So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science If you don't know where the carbon is exactly in detail how can you know what you're losing Basically we need a high-tech accounting system With our system we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail The red shows obviously closed-canopy tropical forest and then you see the cookie cutting or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep And yet we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time And what's amazing is even though we flew very high above this forest later on in analysis we can go in and actually experience the treetrops leaf by leaf branch by branch just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama The colors are going to be going from red to blue Red is extremely high carbon stocks your largest cathedral forests you can imagine and blue are very low carbon stocks And let me tell you Peru alone is an amazing place totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's Avatar We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries Panama and see also a huge range of carbon variation from high in red to low in blue Unfortunately most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands but what you see that's left in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds is the stuff that's up in the mountains One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal That's in the reds and yellows The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change My second question: How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest Let me tell you I spend a lot of time in these places and we're seeing the climate changing already Temperatures are increasing and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts recurring droughts The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide What we found is that in very remote areas these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests For example these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil totally unexplored almost totally unknown scientifically So what we think as Earth scientists is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners You see the forest in green in 3D and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this obviously If you haven't been to the Amazon you should go It's an amazing experience every time no matter where you go You're going to probably see it this way on a river But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself We flew over this same river imaged the system in 3D The forest is on the left And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy And in this case we found gold mining activity all of it illegal set back away from the river's edge as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right Don't worry we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many many other problems in the region So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor we have to start making geographically explicit plans now How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region if it's so unknown to science So what we've been doing is using the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors Reds are one type of species blues are another and greens are yet another And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans And third and final question is how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems The example I started out with about lions hunting that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa And the truth is much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting Some of their decisions have really big impacts For example how much and where to use fire as a management tool Or how to deal with a large species like elephants which may if their populations get too large have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species And let me tell you these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue and just a few trees As we cross this fence line now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants: dense vegetation a radically different ecosystem And in a place like Kruger the soaring elephant densities are a real problem I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you and there are no easy answers with this But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa for example is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants in the red as you see on the screen and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you So really the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life where we have fire management elephant management those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions Going forward I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this Until then you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it Thank you Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you the player the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less This is true so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute you will get to feel joy relief love surprise pride curiosity excitement awe and wonder contentment and creativity all in the span of one minute So this sounds pretty good right Now you're willing to play In order to teach you this game I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly and we're going to do a little hands-on demo While they're coming up I should let you know this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom So thank you Monochrom Okay so most people are familiar with traditional two-person thumb-wrestling Sunni let's just remind them One two three four I declare a thumb war and we wrestle and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling we're the gamer generation There are a billion gamers on the planet now so we need more of a challenge So the first thing we need is more thumbs So Eric come on over So we could get three thumbs together and Peter could join us We could even have four thumbs together and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb This is really important You can't like wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute That is not how you win Ah who did that Eric you did that So Eric would have won He was the first person to pin my thumb Okay so that's the first rule and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node but if you feel ambitious you don't have to hold back We can really go for it So you can see up here Now the only other rule you need to remember is gamer generation we like a challenge I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using So I think we should kind of get some more involved And if we had just four people we would do it just like this and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time Perfect Now if we had more people in the room instead of just wrestling in a closed node we might reach out and try and grab some other people And in fact that's what we're going to do right now We're going to try and get all something like I don't know 1，500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node And we have to connect both levels so if you're up there you're going to be reaching down and reaching up Now before we get started -- This is great You're excited to play before we get started can I have the slides back up here really quick because if you get good at this game I want you to know there are some advanced levels So this is the kind of simple level right But there are advanced configurations This is called the Death Star Configuration Any Star Wars fans And this one's called the Möbius Strip Any science geeks you get that one This is the hardest level This is the extreme So we'll stick with the normal one for now and I'm going to give you 30 seconds every thumb into the node connect the upper and the lower levels you guys go on down there Thirty seconds Into the network Make the node Stand up It's easier if you stand up Everybody up up up up up Stand up my friends All right Don't start wrestling yet If you have a free thumb wave it around make sure it gets connected Okay We need to do a last-minute thumb check If you have a free thumb wave it around to make sure Grab that thumb Reach behind you There you go Any other thumbs Okay on the count of three you're going to go Okay One two three go Did you win You got it You got it Excellent Well done Thank you Thank you very much All right While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions So curiosity I said massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling You were like What the hell is she talking about So I provoked a little curiosity Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up So you used creativity That was great How about surprise The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising You heard that sound go up in the room We had excitement As you started to wrestle maybe you're starting to win or this person's like really into it so you kind of get the excitement going We have relief You got to stand up You've been sitting for awhile so the physical relief getting to shake it out We had joy You were laughing smiling Look at your faces This room is full of joy We had some contentment I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing so you were totally content to be playing The most important three emotions awe and wonder we had everybody connected physically for a minute When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room And it's truly awesome and wondrous And speaking of physical connection you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin you release oxytocin you feel bonded to everyone in the room You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other That is great And the last emotion of pride How many people are like me Just admit it You lost both your thumbs It just didn't work out for you That's okay because you learned a new skill today You learned from scratch a game you never knew before Now you know how to play it You can teach other people So congratulations How many of you won just won thumb All right I have very good news for you According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling this makes you a grandmaster of the game Because there aren't that many people who know how to play we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess So congratulations grandmasters Win one thumb once you will become a grandmaster Did anybody win both their thumbs Yes Awesome Okay Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status You guys according to the rules are legendary grandmasters so congratulations I will just leave you with this tip if you want to play again The best way to become a legendary grandmaster you've got your two nodes going on Pick off the one that looks easiest They're not paying attention They look kind of weak Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm As soon as you win suddenly stop Everybody is thrown off You go in for the kill That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game Wooo Thank you So my name is Amy Webb and a few years ago I found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion And I thought you know what's wrong with me I don't understand why this keeps happening So I asked everybody in my life what they thought I turned to my grandmother who always had plenty of advice and she said Stop being so picky You've got to date around And most importantly true love will find you when you least expect it Now as it turns out I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data as you'll soon find I am constantly swimming in numbers and formulas and charts I also have a very tight-knit family and I'm very very close with my sister and as a result I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up So I'm at the end of this bad breakup I'm 30 years old I figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before I'm ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate and we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged And if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35 that meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago So that wasn't going to work If my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love then the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity In short I was trying to figure out well what's the probability of my finding Mr Right Well at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia and it's a big city and I figured in this entire place there are lots of possibilities So again I started doing some math Population of Philadelphia: It has 1。5 million people I figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to 750，000 I'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36 which was only four percent of the population so now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30，000 men I was looking for somebody who was Jewish because that's what I am and that was important to me That's only 2。3 percent of the population I figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men and there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer So that basically meant there were 35 men for me that I could possibly date in the entire city of Philadelphia In the meantime my very large Jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already So if I have two possible strategies at this point I'm sort of figuring out One I can take my grandmother's advice and sort of least-expect my way into maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men in the entire 1。5 million-person city of Philadelphia or I could try online dating Now I like the idea of online dating because it's predicated on an algorithm and that's really just a simple way of saying I've got a problem I'm going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution So online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture In fact in Judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like is the girl going to like the boy Are the families going to get along What's the rabbi going to say Are they going to start having children right away And the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this So in my case I thought well will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming So I decided to sign on Now there was one small catch As I'm signing on to the various dating websites as it happens I was really really busy But that actually wasn't the biggest problem The biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind and I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes So I just copied and pasted from my résumé So in the descriptive part up top I said that I was an award-winning journalist and a future thinker When I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date I said monetization and fluency in Japanese I talked a lot about JavaScript So obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward But the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date These algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates -- what turned out to be truly awful dates There was this guy Steve the I。T guy The algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data and '80s music and so I agreed to go out with him So Steve the I。T guy invited me out to one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth extremely expensive restaurants And we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasn't taking flight but he was ordering a lot of food In fact he didn't even bother looking at the menu He was ordering multiple appetizers multiple entrées for me as well and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine So we're nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and I've decided Steve the I。T guy and I are really just not meant for each other but we'll part ways as friends when he gets up to go to the bathroom and in the meantime the bill comes to our table And listen I'm a modern woman I am totally down with splitting the bill But then Steve the I。T guy didn't come back And that was my entire month's rent So needless to say I was not having a good night So I run home I call my mother I call my sister and as I do at the end of each one of these terrible terrible dates I regale them with the details And they say to me Stop complaining You're just being too picky So I said fine from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know that there's wi-fi and I'm bringing my laptop I'm going to shove it into my bag and I'm going to have this email template and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible So I started tracking things like really stupid awkward sexual remarks; bad vocabulary; the number of times a man forced me to high-five him So I started to crunch some numbers and that allowed me to make some correlations So as it turns out for some reason men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately Well it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys There were just bad for me And as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up they weren't bad either These algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do which was to take our user-generated information in my case my résumé and match it up with other people's information See the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and I don't when confronted with blank windows where we're supposed to input our information online Very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves The other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person Do you like horror films or romance films I'm not looking for a pen pal I'm looking for a husband Right So there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data So I said fine I've got a new plan I'm going to keep using these online dating sites but I'm going to treat them as databases and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people I decided instead to ask my own questions What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate So I started writing and writing and writing and at the end I had amassed 72 different data points I wanted somebody was Jew。。。ish so I was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture but wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday I wanted somebody who worked hard because work for me is extremely important but not too hard For me the hobbies that I have are really just new work projects that I've launched I also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it So things like that but I also wanted somebody who would go to far-flung exotic places like Petra Jordan I also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times regardless of what I weighed So I now have these 72 different data points which to be fair is a lot So what I did was I went through and I prioritized that list I broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points and I ranked everything starting at 100 and going all the way down to 91 and listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers So once I had all this done I then built a scoring system because what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not I thought the guy that I found online would be a match with me I figured there would be a minimum of 700 points before I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message For 900 points I'd agree to go out on a date and I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship before somebody had crossed the 1，500 point threshold Well as it turns out this worked pretty well So I go back online now I found Jewishdoc57 who's incredibly good-looking incredibly well-spoken he had hiked Mt Fuji he had walked along the Great Wall He likes to travel as long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship And I thought I've done it I've cracked the code I have just found the Jewish Prince Charming of my family's dreams There was only one problem: He didn't like me back And I guess the one variable that I haven't considered is the competition Who are all of the other women on these dating sites I found SmileyGirl1978 She said she was a fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing She listed her job as teacher She said she is silly nice and friendly She likes to make people laugh alot At this moment I knew clicking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this that I needed to do some market research So I created 10 fake male profiles Now before I lose all of you -- -- understand that I did this strictly to gather data about everybody else in the system I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody I really was just scraping their data But I didn't want everybody's data I only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that I really really wanted to marry When I released these men into the wild I did follow some rules So I didn't reach out to any woman first I just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract and mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets So I was looking at qualitative data so what was the humor the tone the voice the communication style that these women shared in common And also quantitative data so what was the average length of their profile how much time was spent between messages What I was trying to get at here was that I figured in person I would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978 I wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online Well one month later I had a lot of data and I was able to do another analysis And as it turns out content matters a lot So smart people tend to write a lot -- 3，000 4，000 5，000 words about themselves which may all be very very interesting The challenge here though is that the popular men and women are sticking to 97 words on average that are written very very well even though it may not seem like it all the time The other sort of hallmark of the people who do this well is that they're using non-specific language So in my case you know The English Patient is my most favorite movie ever but it doesn't work to use that in a profile because that's a superficial data point and somebody may disagree with me and decide they don't want to go out with me because they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie Also optimistic language matters a lot So this is a word cloud highlighting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women words like fun and girl and love And what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile Remember I'm somebody who said that I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript and I was okay with that The difference is that it's about being more approachable and helping people understand the best way to reach out to you And as it turns out timing is also really really important Just because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number or their instant message account and it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people The popular women on these online sites spend an average of 23 hours in between each communication And that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship And finally there were the photos All of the women who were popular showed some skin They all looked really great which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what I had uploaded Once I had all of this information I was able to create a super profile so it was still me but it was me optimized now for this ecosystem And as it turns out I did a really good job I was the most popular person online And as it turns out lots and lots of men wanted to date me So I call my mom I call my sister I call my grandmother I'm telling them about this fabulous news and they say This is wonderful How soon are you going out And I said Well actually I'm not going to go out with anybody Because remember in my scoring system they have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points and none of them have done that They said What You're still being too damn picky Well not too long after that I found this guy Thevenin and he said that he was culturally Jewish which I thought was very clever He talked in detail about travel He made a lot of really interesting cultural references He looked and talked exactly like what I wanted and immediately he scored 850 points It was enough for a date Three weeks later we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant and when he dropped me back off at my house that night I re-scored him -- 1，050 points -- thought you know what this entire time I haven't been picky enough Well a year and a half after that we were non-cruise ship traveling through Petra Jordan when he got down on his knee and proposed A year after that we were married and about a year and a half after that our daughter Petra was born Obviously I'm having a fabulous life so -- -- the question is what does all of this mean for you Well as it turns out there is an algorithm for love It's just not the ones that we're being presented with online In fact it's something that you write yourself So whether you're looking for a husband or a wife or you're trying to find your passion or you're trying to start a business all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want Well on my wedding day I had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said All right maybe I was wrong It looks like you did come up with a really really great system Now your matzoh balls They should be fluffy not hard And I'll take her advice on that So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book and it's a story of something that happened 3，000 years ago when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border there's a mountain range Still same is true of Israel today And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region so Jerusalem Bethlehem Hebron And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean where Tel Aviv is now And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west and you can follow the Shephelah go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains And the Shephelah if you've been to Israel you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel It's gorgeous with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards But more importantly though in the history of that region it's served it's had a real strategic function and that is it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains And 3，000 years ago that's exactly what happens The Philistines who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel are living in the coastal plain They're originally from Crete They're a seafaring people And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two And the Kingdom of Israel which is headed by King Saul obviously catches wind of this and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other because they're deadlocked Neither can attack the other because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side and you're completely exposed So finally to break the deadlock the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor and he calls out and he says to the Israelites Send your mightiest warrior down and we'll have this out just the two of us This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle And the Philistine who is sent down their mighty warrior is a giant He's 6 foot 9 He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear He is absolutely terrifying And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him It's a death wish right There's no way they think they can take him And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy and he goes up to Saul and he says I'll fight him And Saul says You can't fight him That's ridiculous You're this kid This is this mighty warrior But the shepherd is adamant He says No no no you don't understand I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years I think I can do it And Saul has no choice He's got no one else who's come forward So he says All right And then he turns to the kid and he says But you've got to wear this armor You can't go as you are So he tries to give the shepherd his armor and the shepherd says No He says I can't wear this stuff The Biblical verse is I cannot wear this for I have not proved it meaning I've never worn armor before You've got to be crazy So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant And the giant sees this figure approaching and calls out Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him And the shepherd draws closer and closer and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff That's all he's carrying Instead of a weapon just this shepherd's staff and he says -- he's insulted -- Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes -- right here in his most vulnerable spot -- and he falls down either dead or unconscious and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run And of course the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong So David in that story is supposed to be the underdog right In fact that term David and Goliath has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger Now why do we call David an underdog Well we call him an underdog because he's a kid a little kid and Goliath is this big strong giant We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior and David is just a shepherd But most importantly we call him an underdog because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear and all David has is this sling Well let's start there with the phrase All David has is this sling because that's the first mistake that we make In ancient warfare there are three kinds of warriors There's cavalry men on horseback and with chariots There's heavy infantry which are foot soldiers armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor And there's artillery and artillery are archers but more importantly slingers And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it and they put a projectile either a rock or a lead ball inside the pouch and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target That's what David has and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot It's not this right It's not a child's toy It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon When David rolls it around like this he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second and that means that when the rock is released it's going forward really fast probably 35 meters per second That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers More than that the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks They were barium sulphate which are rocks twice the density of normal stones If you do the calculations on the ballistics on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a 。45 caliber handgun This is an incredibly devastating weapon Accuracy we know from historical records that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards From medieval tapestries we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight They were incredibly accurate When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath he's quite close to Goliath -- when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes If you go back over the history of ancient warfare you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another So what's Goliath He's heavy infantry and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman When he says Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the key phrase is Come to me Come up to me because we're going to fight hand to hand like this Saul has the same expectation David says I want to fight Goliath and Saul tries to give him his armor because Saul is thinking Oh when you say 'fight Goliath，' you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat，' infantry on infantry But David has absolutely no expectation He's not going to fight him that way Why would he He's a shepherd He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves That's where his strength lies So here he is this shepherd experienced in the use of a devastating weapon up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat Goliath is a sitting duck He doesn't have a chance So why do we keep calling David an underdog and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable There's a second piece of this that's important It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath Goliath is not what he seems to be There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior So to begin with the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant Now that is weird right Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy presumably to the point of combat Secondly the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David So David's coming down the mountain and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat There is nothing about him that says I am about to fight you like this He's not even carrying a sword Why does Goliath not react to that It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day And then there's that strange comment he makes to David: Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks Sticks David only has one stick Well it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies There have been many articles written The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era and usually when someone is that far out of the norm there's an explanation for it So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone And throughout history many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11 He had acromegaly Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant Famous He had acromegaly There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly Anyone who's unusually tall that's the first explanation we come up with And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it principally having to do with vision The pituitary tumor as it grows often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath they've said Wait a minute he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant Because he can't make his way on his own Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment Because he can't see him When he says Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the phrase come to me is a hint also of his vulnerability Come to me because I can't see you And then there's Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks He sees two sticks when David has only one So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness And there is I think in that a very important lesson for all of us Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket Thank you So he's Mario He's our son He was born two and a half years ago and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for like eight months But in the end everything seemed to be under control So he got the right weight at birth He got the right Apgar index So we were pretty reassured by this But at the end 10 days later after he was born we discovered that he had a stroke As you might know a stroke is a brain injury A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth and in his case as you can see the right part of his brain has gone So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario's body could be the fact that he couldn't be able to control the left side of his body Just imagine if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit to input to print out a document but the printer doesn't have the right drives so the same is for Mario It's just like he would like to move his left side of his body but he's not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg So life had to change We needed to change our schedule We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life As you may imagine unfortunately we were not ready Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds And that has been really a tough time Questions some basics like you know why did this happen to us And what went wrong Some more tough like really what will be the impact on Mario's life I mean at the end will he be able to work Will he be able to be normal And you know as a parent especially for the first time why is he not going to be better than us And this indeed really is tough to say but a few months later we realized that we were really feeling like a failure I mean the only real product of our life at the end was a failure And you know it was not a failure for ourselves in itself but it was a failure that will impact his full life Honestly we went down I mean we went really down but at the end we started to look at him and we said we have to react So immediately as Francesca said we changed our life We started physiotherapy we started the rehabilitation and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot Basically we spent months doing this with Mario You have an object and we showed him how to grab the object Now the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains exactly now as you watch me doing this you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand He was looking at us We were his mirror And the problem as you might feel is that we were down we were depressed we were looking at him as a problem not as a son not from a positive perspective And that day really changed our perspective We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario We restarted from our strengths and at the same time we restarted from his strengths We stopped looking at him as a problem and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve And really this was the change and from our side we said What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario And we started from our passions I mean at the end my wife and myself are quite different but we have many things in common We love to travel we love music we love to be in places like this and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him This short video is from last week I am not saying -- I am not saying it's a miracle That's not the message because we are just at the beginning of the path But we want to share what was the key learning the key learning that Mario drove to us and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity And this is the message that we want to share with you This is why we are here Mario And this is why -- And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him And we thank you so much all of you Thank you Thank you Bye Thank you I love paper and I love technology and what I do is I make paper interactive And that's what I say when people ask me what I do but it really confuses most people so really the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences So I tried to think what I could use for here and a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea that I wanted to print two DJ decks and to try and mix some music And I'm going to try and show that at the end and the suspense will be as much mine if it works And I'm not a DJ and I'm not a musician so I'm a little bit scared of that So I think I found the best way to describe my journey that have happened to me throughout my life and I'll just describe those first and then talk about some of my work So when I was a kid I was obsessed with wires and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away And I was also really interested in wireless as well So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter and then I placed it next to my dad so I could eavesdrop I was not at all interested in what he was saying It's more that I just liked the idea and doing something different Several year later I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all and my parents maybe as a reward bought me what turned out to be and I came back home about four years later I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere It was in far western New South Wales There were 22，000 sheep and it was about 40 degrees or 100 or so Fahrenheit And on this farm there was the farmer his wife and there was the four-year-old daughter And they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work Obviously one of the most important things was the sheep and so my job was well pretty much to do everything but it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead And we'd do that by building fences using motorbikes and horses to the shearing shed for the different seasons And what I learned was although at the time like everyone else I thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn't do what we wanted them to do what I realize now probably only just in the last few weeks looking back is the sheep weren't stupid at all We'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be and they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do So the challenge was to try and get them by listening to the weather the lay of the land and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go Another bunch of years later at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U。K doing a Ph。D in physics And I realize again it's kind of these realizations looking back as to what I did as moving sheep around It really is It's just you do it by changing an environment And that's kind of been a big lesson to me that you can't act on any object You change its environment and the object will flow So we made it very small so things were about 30 nanometers in size; making it very cold so at liquid helium temperatures; and changing environment by changing the voltage and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time on and off a little memory node And I wanted to go one step further and one electron off And I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this that's the thing that makes you do it And I was determined and I managed to show that I could do that And a lot of that learning I think because when I was working on the farm we'd have to use what was around us we'd have to use the environment and there was no such thing as something can't be done because you're in an environment where if you can't do what you need to do you can die and you know I had seen that sort of thing happen So now my obsession is printing and I'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive When I spoke to some printers when I started doing this and told them what I wanted to do which was to print conductive inks onto paper they told me it couldn't be done again that kind of favorite thing So I got about 10 credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy really and bought myself this huge printing press which I had no idea how to use at all It was about five meters long and I covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess but I learned to print And then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done and they were like Of course you can do that Why didn't you come here in the first place That's always the case So what we do is we take conventional printing presses we make conductive inks and run those through a press and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive And it's pretty simple really It's just a collection of things that have been done before but bringing them together in a different way So we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips one to run some capacitive touch software so we know where we've touched it and the other to run quite often some wireless software so the piece of paper can connect So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created This is one of them because I love cake And this one it's a large poster and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it and asks you a series of questions and it works out your perfect cake It uploads a picture to our Facebook page and to Twitter between the physical and the digital but have it not looking on a screen and just looking like a regular poster looking at interactive newsprint So for example we've created a newspaper a regular newspaper and when you touch it you can hear the music that's described on the top which is something you can't read You can hear a press conference that press conference was about And you can press a Facebook like button or you can vote on something as well and this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago and so we've done a project on this It was for funding from the government for user-centered design for energy-efficient buildings difficult to say and something I had no idea what it was when I went into the workshop but quickly learned And we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better And I really liked the idea that instead of looking at dials and reading things to say -- looking at your energy usage I wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color-changing inks on it and so if your energy usage was trending better and all would be good And if it wasn't then there'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees So it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment which you don't want to see not looking so good rather than expecting people to do things that it has a long way off And I think kind of like going back to the farm it's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do Okay So this is the bit I'm really scared of So a couple of things I've created are there's a poster over here that you can play drums on And I am not a musician It seemed like a good idea at the time If anyone wants to try and play drums then they can I'll just describe how this works This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone and when you touch it it connects to the app And it has really good response time It's using Bluetooth 4 so it's pretty instantaneous Okay Thanks And there's a couple of other things So this one is like a sound board so you can touch it and I just love these horrible noises Okay and this is a D。J turntable So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad and this is a software that's running on the iPad Oh yes I just love doing that I'm not a D。J。 though but I just always wanted to do that So I have a crossfader and I have the two decks So I've made some new technology and I love things being creative and I love working with creative people So my 15-year-old niece she's amazing and she's called Charlotte and I asked her to record something and I worked with a friend called Elliot to put some beats together So this is my niece Charlotte Yay So that's pretty much what I do I just love bringing technology together having a lot of fun being creative But it's not about the technology It's just about I want to create some great experiences So thank you very much Writing biography is a strange thing to do It's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else's life a journey an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can't quite believe you've been especially if like me you're an agnostic Jew and the life you've been exploring is that of Muhammad Five years ago for instance I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle to what I knew was an impossible question: one desert night half the world and almost half of history away What happened that is on the night in the year 610 when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran on a mountain just outside Mecca This is the core mystical moment of Islam and as such of course it defies empirical analysis Yet the question wouldn't let go of me I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah And I plead guilty as charged because all exploration physical or intellectual is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression of crossing boundaries Still some boundaries are larger than others So a human encountering the divine as Muslims believe Muhammad did to the rationalist this is a matter not of fact but of wishful fiction Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air He did not run down shouting Hallelujah and Bless the Lord He did not radiate light and joy There were no choirs of angels no music of the spheres no elation no ecstasy no golden aura surrounding him no sense of an absolute fore-ordained role as the messenger of God That is he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul to put down the whole story as a pious fable Quite the contrary In his own reported words he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn't have been real At best he thought it had to have been a hallucination -- a trick of the eye or the ear perhaps or his own mind working against him At worst possession -- that he'd been seized by an evil jinn a spirit out to deceive him even to crush the life out of him In fact he was so sure that he could only be majnun possessed by a jinn that when he found himself still alive his first impulse was to finish the job himself to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he'd experienced by putting an end to all experience So the man who fled down the mountain that night trembled not with joy but with a stark primordial fear He was overwhelmed not with conviction but by doubt And that panicked disorientation that sundering of everything familiar that daunting awareness of something beyond human comprehension can only be called a terrible awe This might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word awesome to describe a new app or a viral video With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake we're protected from real awe We close the doors and hunker down convinced that we're in control or at least hoping for control We do our best to ignore the fact that we don't always have it and that not everything can be explained Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside what's clear is that he did experience them and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic justice Fear was the only sane response the only human response Too human for some like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned despite the fact that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies They insist that he never doubted for even a single moment let alone despaired Demanding perfection they refuse to tolerate human imperfection Yet what exactly is imperfect about doubt As I read those early accounts I realized it was precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me that allowed me to begin to see him in full to accord him the integrity of reality And the more I thought about it the more it made sense that he doubted because doubt is essential to faith If this seems a startling idea at first consider that doubt as Graham Greene once put it is the heart of the matter Abolish all doubt and what's left is not faith but absolute heartless conviction You're certain that you possess the Truth -- inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T -- and this certainty quickly devolves into dogmatism and righteousness by which I mean a demonstrative overweening pride in being so very right in short the arrogance of fundamentalism It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists known as Crusaders: infidel from the Latin for faithless Doubly ironic in this case because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith In effect they are the infidels Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes they have no questions only answers They found the perfect antidote to thought and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob wrestling through the night with the angel or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness or like Muhammad not only that night on the mountain but throughout his years as a prophet with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair and condemning those who most loudly proclaim that they know everything there is to know and that they and they alone are right And yet we the vast and still far too silent majority have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority We've allowed Judaism to be claimed by violently messianic West Bank settlers Christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots Islam by suicide bombers And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be Christians Jews or Muslims militant extremists are none of the above They're a cult all their own blood brothers steeped in other people's blood This isn't faith It's fanaticism and we have to stop confusing the two We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers It's difficult and stubborn It involves an ongoing struggle a continual questioning of what we think we know a wrestling with issues and ideas It goes hand in hand with doubt in a never-ending conversation with it and sometimes in conscious defiance of it And this conscious defiance is why I as an agnostic can still have faith I have faith for instance that peace in the Middle East is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary I'm not convinced of this I can hardly say I believe it I can only have faith in it commit myself that is to the idea of it and I do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence Because despair is self-fulfilling If we call something impossible we act in such a way that we make it so And I for one refuse to live that way In fact most of us do whether we're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond for that matter what drives us is that despite our doubts and even because of our doubts we reject the nihilism of despair We insist on faith in the future and in each other Call this naive if you like Call it impossibly idealistic if you must But one thing is sure: Call it human Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty I think not After keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years I can't see that he'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism He'd call out terrorism for what it is not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity Anyone who saves a life saves the life of all humanity And he'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace Thank you Thank you Once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity This was called the Great Moderation the misguided belief by most economists policymakers and central banks that we have transformed into a new world This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth by low unemployment and controlled and low financial volatility But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008 the great crash broke this illusion A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector of losses in world GDP in the global stock market So the understanding of this Great Recession was that this was completely surprising this came out of the blue this was like the wrath of the gods There was no responsibility So as a reflection of this we started the Financial Crisis Observatory We had the goal to diagnose in real time financial bubbles and identify in advance their critical time What is the underpinning scientifically of this financial observatory We developed a theory called dragon-kings which are of a class of their own They are special They are outliers They are generated by specific mechanisms that may make them predictable perhaps controllable Consider the financial price time series a given stock your perfect stock You have these up-and-downs A very good measure of the risk of this financial market is the peaks-to-valleys that represent a worst case scenario when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom You can look at the statistics the frequency of the occurrence which is represented in this graph Now interestingly 99 percent of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes can be represented by a universal power law represented by this red line here More interestingly there are outliers there are exceptions which are above this red line occur 100 times more frequently at least than the extrapolation would predict them to occur based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining They are due to trenchant dependancies such that a loss is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss These kinds of dependencies when they should see dragon-kings The root mechanism of a dragon-king is a slow maturation towards instability which is the bubble and the climax of the bubble is often the crash This is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor And this process which is absolutely non-linear -- cannot be predicted by standard techniques -- is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous So the cause of the crash the cause of the crisis Now some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently Remember black swan is this rare bird that all swans should be white so it has captured the idea of unpredictability unknowability that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable from the dragon-king concept I propose which is exactly the opposite that most extreme events So we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept that are predicted by this theory Let me just focus on one of them: the super-exponential growth with positive feedback What does it mean Imagine you have an investment that returns the first year five percent the second year 10 percent the third year 20 percent the next year 40 percent Is that not marvelous This is a super-exponential growth A standard exponential growth corresponds to a constant growth rate let's say of 10 percent there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times such that previous growths enhance push forward increase the next growth through this kind of super-exponential growth which is very trenchant not sustainable And the key idea is that the mathematical solution of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities which means that there is a critical time where the system will break will change regime It may be a crash It may be just a plateau something else And the key idea is that the critical time the information about the critical time is contained in the early development of this super-exponential growth We have applied this theory early on that was our first success to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket Using acoustic emission you know this little noise that you hear a structure emit sing to you when they are stressed and reveal the damage going on there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback the more damage gives the more damage so you can actually predict within of course a probability band when the rupture will occur So this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of unclear the flight Perhaps more surprisingly the same type of theory applies to biology and medicine parturition the act of giving birth epileptic seizures From seven months of pregnancy a mother starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus toward the instability giving birth to the baby the dragon-king So if you measure the precursor signal in advance Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size and when the brain goes to a super-critical state you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability We have applied this theory to many systems landslides glacier collapse even to the dynamics of prediction of success: blockbusters YouTube videos movies and so on But perhaps the most important application is for finance and this theory for the financial crisis that we have gone through This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles starting in 1980 with the global bubble followed by many other bubbles The biggest one was the new economy Internet bubble in 2000 crashing in 2000 the real estate bubbles in many countries financial derivative bubbles everywhere stock market bubbles also everywhere commodity and all bubbles debt and credit bubbles -- bubbles bubbles bubbles We had a global bubble of all markets expressing what I call an illusion of a perpetual money machine that suddenly broke in 2007 The problem is that we see the same process in particular through quantitative easing of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U。S。 in Europe in Japan This has very important implications to understand the failure of quantitative easing as well as austerity measures the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking Now these are big claims Why would you believe me Well perhaps because in the last 15 years we have come out of our ivory tower and I stress the term ex ante it means in advance the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses These are a few of the major bubbles that we have lived through in recent history Again many interesting stories for each of them Let me tell you just one or two stories that deal with massive bubbles We all know the Chinese miracle This is the expression of the stock market of a massive bubble a factor of three 300 percent in just a few years In September 2007 management conference and I showed to the conference a prediction that by the end of 2007 this bubble would change regime There might be a crash Certainly not sustainable Now how do you believe the very smart very motivated very informed macro hedge fund managers reacted to this prediction just surfing this bubble until now They told me Didier yeah the market might be overvalued but you forget something in August 2008 and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market Three weeks after my presentation the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility upheaval and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year So how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed and the system is ripe any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control The Chinese market collapsed but it rebounded In 2009 we also identified that this new bubble so we published again a prediction in advance stating that by August 2009 the market will correct will not continue on this track Our critics reading the prediction said No it's not possible The Chinese government is there They have learned their lesson They will control They want to benefit from the growth Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously So the crisis did occur The market corrected The same critics then said Ah yes but you published your prediction You influenced the market It was not a prediction Maybe I am very powerful then Now this is interesting It shows that it's essentially impossible until now to develop a science of economics because we are sentient beings who anticipate and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies So we invented a new way of doing science We created the Financial Bubble Experiment The idea is the following We monitor the markets We identify excesses bubbles We do our work We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time We don't release the report It's kept secret But with modern encrypting techniques we have a hash we publish a public key and six months later we release the report and there is authentication And all this is done on an international archive so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes Let me tease you with a very recent analysis 17th of May 2013 just two weeks ago we identified that the U。S stock market was on an unsustainable path and we released this on our website on the 21st of May that there will be a change of regime The next day the market started to change regime course This is not a crash This is just the third or fourth act of a massive bubble in the making Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet we see the same thing Wherever we look it's observable: in the biosphere in the atmosphere in the ocean showing these super-exponential trajectories and announcing a phase transition This diagram on the right suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades So there are bubbles everywhere From one side this is exciting for me as a professor who chases bubbles and slays dragons as the media has sometimes called me But can we really slay the dragons Very recently with collaborators we studied a dynamical system where you see the dragon-king as these big loops and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times that removed when control is on these dragons Gouverner c'est prévoir Governing is the art of planning and predicting But is it not the case that this is probably one of the biggest gaps of mankind in the face of growing challenges and crises But the dragon-king theory gives hope We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises so that we can be prepared we can take measures we can take responsibility and so that never again will extremes and crises like the Great Recession Thank you This will not be a speech like any one I have ever given I will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and in our globalizing economy And I won't provide some feel-good ready-made solutions But I will in the end urge you to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what I see as a global evolution of democracy Failure of leadership What is the failure of leadership today And why is our democracy not working Well I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken you out of the process So let me from my personal experiences give you an insight so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley Let's start from the beginning Let's start from democracy Well if you go back to the Ancient Greeks it was a revelation a discovery that we had the potential together to be masters of our own fate to be able to examine to learn to imagine and then to design a better life And democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants or of high priests their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth Well I first began to understand this when I was 14 years old I used to to try to avoid homework sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly You see then Greece was under control of a very powerful establishment which was strangling the country and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine Greece to imagine a Greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule their own country I used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him I'm the younger one there to the side You may not recognize me because I used to part my hair differently there So in 1967 elections were coming things were going well in the campaign the house was electric We really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in Greece Then one night military trucks drive up to our house Soldiers storm the door They find me up on the top terrace A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says Tell me where your father is or I will kill you My father hiding nearby reveals himself and was summarily taken to prison Well we survived but democracy did not Seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile Now today our democracies are again facing a moment of truth Let me tell you a story Sunday evening Brussels April 2010 I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union I had just been elected prime minister but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not 6 percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government but actually 15。6 percent But the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that Greece was facing and I had been elected on a mandate a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system politics and media captured by special interests But despite our electoral mandate the markets mistrusted us Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default So I went to Brussels on a mission to make the case for a united European response one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms But time we didn't get Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels Negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then 10 minutes to 2 a prime minister shouts out We have to finish in 10 minutes I said Why These are important decisions Let's deliberate a little bit longer Another prime minister comes in and says No we have to have an agreement now because in 10 minutes the markets are opening up in Japan and there will be havoc in the global economy We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes This time it was not the military but the markets that put a gun to our collective heads What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life painful to me painful to my countrymen imposing cuts austerity often on those not to blame for the crisis With these sacrifices Greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse Greece yes triggered the Euro crisis and some people blame me for pulling the trigger But I think today that most would agree that Greece was only a symptom of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system vulnerabilities of our democracies Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control Our democracies are weakened in the global economy evade environmental or labor standards Our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality lobbies corruption the speed of the markets or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster have constrained our democracies and they have constrained our capacity to imagine and actually use the potential your potential in finding solutions Greece you see was only a preview of what is in store for us all I overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece for Europe for the world to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions Instead I had a very humbling experience In Brussels when we tried desperately again and again I realized that not one not one of us had ever dealt with a similar crisis But worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance We were led by our fears And our fears led to a blind faith in the orthodoxy of austerity Instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our societies investing in it to find more creative solutions we reverted to political posturing And then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective European failure and of course that was Greece they are the problem Punish them Well a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself But let me warn you this is not just about Greece This could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex cross-border problems whether it's climate change whether it's migration whether it's the financial system That is abandoning our collective power to imagine our potential falling victims to our fears our stereotypes our dogmas taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around our citizens And doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process and I don't exclude myself have lost the trust of our people When riot police have to protect parliaments a scene which is increasingly common around the world then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package My European counterparts some of them at least said You can't do this There will be havoc in the markets again I said We need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people Since leaving office I have had time to reflect We have weathered the storm in Greece and in Europe but we remain challenged If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion So far we've thrown economics at the problem actually mostly austerity and certainly we could have designed alternatives a different strategy a green stimulus for green jobs or mutualized debt Eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures these would have been much more viable alternatives Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of democracy So let's try something else Let's see how we can bring people back to the process Let's throw democracy at the problem Again the Ancient Greeks with all their shortcomings believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments In people we trust Democracy could not work without the citizens deliberating debating taking on public responsibilities for public affairs Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to decide on critical matters of the day Science theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises Actually they were an education for participation for the potential for growing the potential of our citizens And those who shunned politics well they were idiots You see in Ancient Greece in ancient Athens that term originated there Idiot comes from the root idio oneself A person who is self-centered secluded excluded someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs And participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation You see markets and politics then were one unified accessible transparent because they gave power to the people They serve the demos democracy Above government above markets was the direct rule of the people Today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions So our politicians are limited to local politics while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey to forces beyond their control So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora How do we democratize globalization And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the United Nations or the G20 I'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values so that we can tap into all of your potential Well this is exactly where I think Europe fits in Europe despite its recent failures is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment So let's see if it can't be an experiment in global democracy a new kind of democracy Let's see if we can't design a European agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can work together deliberate learn from each other exchange between art and cultures where they can come up with creative solutions Let's imagine that European citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a European president or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues a European-wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties Why not have the first truly European citizens by giving our immigrants not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship but a European citizenship And make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe Where our common identity is democracy where our education is through participation and where participation builds trust and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia Europe of and by the people a Europe an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders Now some might accuse me of being naive putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people Well after decades in politics I am also a pragmatist Believe me I have been I am part of today's political system and I know things must change We must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign for a better world But I also know that this disruptive force of change won't be driven by the politics of today The revival of democratic politics will come from you and I mean all of you Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it's here in this room or just outside this room or online or locally where everybody lives everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality everybody who stands up to those who preach racism rather than empathy dogma rather than critical thinking technocracy rather than democracy everyone who stands up to the unchecked power whether it's authoritarian leaders plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few It is in their interest that all of us are idiots You seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets and that scene in Brussels that you describe to me as a citizen is terrifying Help us understand how you felt after the decision It was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as George George Papandreou: Well obviously there were constraints which didn't allow me or others to make the types of decisions we would have wanted and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time to make the reforms which would have dealt with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit which was the symptom of the problem And that hurt That hurt because that first of all hurt the younger generation and not only many of them are demonstrating outside but I think this is one of our problems When we face these crises we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and we are closing in on ourselves in politics and I think we need to change that to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have and I think we can find solutions which are much better but we have to be open You seem to suggest that the way forward is more Europe and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most European countries It's rather the other way -- more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the European construction How do you reconcile that GP: Well I think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game And the fundamental idea of Europe is that we can cooperate beyond borders go beyond our conflicts and work together And the paradox is that because we have this blame game we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together Now more Europe for me is not simply giving more power to Brussels It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe that is really making Europe a project of the people So that I think would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society George thank you for coming to TED GP: Thank you very much Thank you So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters or quads for short Quads have been around for a long time The reason that they're so popular these days is because they're mechanically simple By controlling the speeds of these four propellers these machines can roll pitch yaw and accelerate along their common orientation On board are also a battery a computer various sensors and wireless radios Quads are extremely agile but this agility comes at a cost They are inherently unstable and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly So how did it just do that Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms which in turn sends commands to the quad which is also running estimation and control algorithms The bulk of our research is algorithms It's the magic that brings these machines to life So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete We use something broadly called model-based design We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them For example that's how we can make the quad hover We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole With a little bit of practice it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top which means that it can be located in the space You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced How did we design the algorithms to do this We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it Here you see that it's stable and even if I give it little nudges it goes back to the nice balanced position We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space Using this pointer made out of reflective markers I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it Unlike the balancing pole I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system In fact the system doesn't even know that the glass of water is there Like before I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space Okay you should be asking yourself why doesn't the water fall out of the glass Two facts: The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass pointing up You put these two things together the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects which as these speeds are negligible And that's why you don't need to model the glass It naturally doesn't spill no matter what the quad does The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard In this instance carrying a glass of water is easy Balancing a pole is hard We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly because there are four degrees of freedom to control: roll pitch yaw and acceleration Hexacopters and octocopters with six and eight propellers can provide redundancy but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four Or do they If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it We relinquish control of yaw but roll pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible In this instance this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage just like human athletes do instead of building machines with redundancy We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water or when a vaulter is twisting in the air the ground fast approaching Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry Will the vaulter stick the landing Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution There simply isn't enough time Instead what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly observe how it finishes the maneuver and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better Similar to the diver and the vaulter it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple so not too large The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds or 50 times per second We first figure out where the ball is going We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from Third a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball Fourth we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy Twenty milliseconds later the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own they can do it collectively These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me Notice that at full extension these quads are vertical In fact when fully extended this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time Similar to the pointer that I used earlier we can use this as inputs to the system We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures Interaction doesn't have to be virtual It can be physical Take this quad for example It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space If I try to move it out of the way it fights me and moves back to where it wants to be We can change this behavior however We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad Once we know this force we can also change the laws of physics as far as the quad is concerned of course Here the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine I will use this new capability to position this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics Let's have a little bit of fun with this For what you will see next these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto As time goes on gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth but I assure you we won't get there Okay here goes Whew You're all thinking now these guys are having way too much fun and you're probably also asking yourself why exactly are they building machine athletes Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities Others think that it has more of a social role that it's used to bind the group Similarly we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life Like all our past creations and innovations they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused This is not a technical choice we are faced with; it's a social one Let's make the right choice the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team Sergei Lupashin Mark Muller and Robin Ritz Look out for them They're destined for great things Thank you I made a film that was impossible to make but I didn't know it was impossible and that's how I was able to do it Mars et Avril is a science fiction film It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive it's set in the future and it's got tons of visual effects and it's shot on green screen Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make ever since I was a kid really back when I was reading some comic books and dreaming about what the future might be When American producers see my film they think that I had a big budget to do it like 23 million But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget I did Mars et Avril for only 2。3 million So you might wonder what's the deal here How did I do this Well it's two things First it's time When you don't have money you must take time and it took me seven years to do Mars et Avril The second aspect is love I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved And it seems like every department had nothing so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity And that brings me to the point of my talk actually how constraints big creative constraints can boost creativity In my early 20s I did some graphic novels but they weren't your usual graphic novels They were books telling a science fiction story through images and text and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these books portraying characters into a sort of experimental theatrical simplistic way And one of these actors is the great stage director and actor Robert Lepage And I just love this guy I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid His career I admire a lot And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of Eugène Spaak who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation in between time space love music and women And he was a perfect fit for the part and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance He was the one who believed in me and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books into a film and to write direct and produce the film myself And Robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet I mean his agenda is booked until 2042 and he's really hard to get and I wanted him to be in the movie to reprise his role in the movie But the thing is had I waited for him until 2042 my film wouldn't be a futuristic film anymore so I just couldn't do that Right But that's kind of a big problem How do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie Well I said as a joke in a production meeting -- and this is a true story by the way I said Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram Because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he's an illuminated being in my mind and he's in between reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram Everybody around the table laughed but the joke was kind of a good solution so that's what we ended up doing Here's how we did it We shot Robert with six cameras He was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head so that in post-production we could use pretty much any angle we needed and we shot only his head Six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the vehicle for the head And he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with Robert Lepage's head So he became like a renaissance man and here's what it looks like in the movie Robert Lepage: As usual Arthur's drawing didn't account for the technical challenges I welded the breech but the valve is still gaping I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box but I might have hit a heartstring It still sounds too low Jacques Languirand: That's normal The instrument always ends up resembling its model Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments that you see in this excerpt they're my second example of how constraints can boost creativity because I desperately needed these objects in my movie They are objects of desire They are imaginary musical instruments And they carry a nice story with them Actually I knew what these things would look like in my mind for many many years But my problem was I didn't have the money to pay for them I couldn't afford them So that's kind of a big problem too How do you get something that you can't afford And you know I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea I said What if I have somebody else pay for them But who on Earth would be interested by seven not-yet-built musical instruments inspired by women's bodies because who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen So I found my way to Guy Laliberté Cirque du Soleil's CEO and I presented my crazy idea to him with sketches like this and visual references and something pretty amazing happened Guy was interested by this idea not because I was asking for his money but because I came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy It was kind of a perfect triangle in which the art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price because they weren't even made He took a leap of faith And the artist Dominique Engel brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments So here they are And my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green because this is a weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later And I had again pretty much ideas in my mind as to what the world would be but then again I turned to my childhood imagination and went to the work of Belgian comic book master François Schuiten in Belgium And this guy is another guy I admire a lot and I wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer But people told me you know Martin it's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no Well I said you know what instead of mimicking his style I might as well call the real guy and ask him and I sent him my books and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium In other words there was space for him to dream with me So here I was with one of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that's in the film to turn that into Montreal in the future And it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom I admire But then you know eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality So again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that I could think of And there's this guy in Montreal another Quebecois called Carlos Monzon and he's a very good VFX artist This guy had been lead compositor on such films as Avatar and Star Trek and Transformers and other unknown projects like this and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job and I had to convince him and instead of working on the next Spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine Why Because I offered him a space to dream So if you don't have money to offer to people you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of So this is what happened on this movie and that's how it got made and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale for six months to do this crazy film So I want to tell you that if you have some crazy ideas in your mind and that people tell you that it's impossible to make well that's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the final result whereas if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way I have experienced it And you might end up doing some crazy projects and who knows you might even end up going to Mars Thank you When I was a young boy I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house And they were remarkably well preserved morphologically just phenomenal And we used to imagine that someday they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin and if they could they would fly away If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals I would have told you it's unlikely If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species I would have said pipe dream But I'm actually standing here today amazingly to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility actually a modern-day reality but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach maybe not from the insects in amber -- in fact this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for Jurassic Park but from woolly mammoths the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost Woollies are a particularly interesting quintessential image of the Ice Age They were large They were hairy They had large tusks and we seem to have a very deep connection with them like we do with elephants Maybe it's because elephants share many things in common with us They bury their dead They educate the next of kin They have social knits that are very close Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time because elephants like us share their origins in Africa some seven million years ago and as habitats changed and environments changed we actually like the elephants migrated out into Europe and Asia So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis which was standing four meters tall weighing about 10 tons and was a woodland-adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America And then again as climate changed as it always does and new habitats opened up we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe And the open grassland savannas of North America opened up leading to the Columbian mammoth a large hairless species in North America And it was really only about 500，000 years later that we had the arrival of the woolly the one that we all know and love so much spreading from an East Beringian point of origin across Central Asia again pushing the trogontherii out through Central Europe and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the Columbian relatives living in the south and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment and doing very very well And there they survive on the mainland until about 10，000 years ago and actually surprisingly on the small islands off of Siberia and Alaska until about 3，000 years ago So Egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands And then they disappear Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived they go extinct likely due to a warming climate and fast-encroaching dense forests that are migrating north and also as the late great Paul Martin once put it probably Pleistocene overkill so the large game hunters that took them down Fortunately we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in Siberia and Alaska and we can actually go up there and actually take them out And the preservation is again like those insects in amber phenomenal So you have teeth bones with blood which look like blood you have hair and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them So the preservation and the survival of DNA depends on many factors and I have to admit most of which we still don't quite understand but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he's buried the depth of that burial the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive over geologically meaningful time frames And it's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters it's not the length of preservation it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most So if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process the DNA which was once intact tightly wrapped around histone proteins is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime So those bacteria along with the environmental bacteria free water and oxygen actually break apart the DNA into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments until all you have are fragments that range from 10 base pairs to in the best case scenarios a few hundred base pairs in length So most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures But a few of them actually have DNA fragments that survive for thousands even a few millions of years in time And using state-of-the-art clean room technology we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs away from all the rest of the gunk in there and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth and more complicated I'll get all the DNA that survived in that environment with it so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth Not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth whereas something like the Columbian mammoth living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous But we've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate capture and discriminate the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re-jig all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone of an Asian or African elephant chromosome And so by doing that we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant and what do we know then about a mammoth Well the mammoth genome is almost at full completion and we know that it's actually really big It's mammoth So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger and most of that is composed of small repetitive DNAs that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome So having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives the African and the Asian elephant all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants about six million years ago so slightly closer to the Asian elephant With advances in ancient DNA technology we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned and I just wanted to talk about two of them the woolly and the Columbian mammoth both of which were living very close to each other during glacial peaks so when the glaciers were massive in North America the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones and came into contact with the relatives living to the south and there they shared refugia and a little bit more than the refugia it turns out It looks like they were interbreeding And that this is not an uncommon feature in Proboscideans because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females So large hairless Columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies It reminds me a bit of high school unfortunately So this is not trivial given the idea that we want to revive extinct species because it turns out that an African and an Asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in Chester U。K。 in 1978 So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes modify them into all those positions we've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome we can put that into an enucleated cell differentiate that into a stem cell subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg and over a long and arduous procedure actually bring back something that looks like this Now this wouldn't be an exact replica because the short DNA fragments that I told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did Now when I bring up this with my friends we often talk about well where would you put it Where are you going to house a mammoth There's no climates or habitats suitable Well that's not actually the case It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth Remember this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation So this landscape would be easily able to house it and I have to admit that there is a part of the child in me the boy in me that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again but I do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders whether or not we should Thank you very much Ryan Phelan: Don't go away You've left us with a question I'm sure everyone is asking this When you say Should we it feels like you're reticent there and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible What's your reticence Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence I think it's just that we have to think very deeply about the implications ramifications of our actions and so as long as we have good deep discussion like we're having now I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it But I just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we're doing it first RP: Perfect Perfect answer Thank you very much Hendrik HP: Thank you a paradigm-shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence -- sexual assault domestic violence relationship abuse sexual harassment sexual abuse of children That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthand as gender violence issues they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it I don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with In fact I'm going to argue that these are men's issues first and foremost Now obviously they're also women's issues so I appreciate that but calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem for a number of reasons The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention Right A lot of men hear the term women's issues and we tend to tune it out and we think Hey I'm a guy That's for the girls or That's for the women And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term women's issues This is also true by the way of the word gender because a lot of people hear the word gender and they think it means women So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues There's some confusion about the term gender And actually let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy So let's talk for a moment about race In the U。S。 when we hear the word race a lot of people think that means African-American Latino Asian-American Native American South Asian Pacific Islander on and on A lot of people when they hear the word sexual orientation think it means gay lesbian bisexual And a lot of people when they hear the word gender think it means women In each case the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to Right As if white people don't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct as if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation as if men don't have a gender This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance because that's one of the key characteristics lacking introspection in fact being rendered invisible about issues that are primarily about us And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men by using the old tech I work with -- I make films -- and I work with high tech but I'm still old school as an educator and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the sentence structure level how the way that we think literally the way that we use language conspires to keep our attention off of men This is about domestic violence in particular but you can plug in other analogues This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope It starts with a very basic English sentence: John beat Mary That's a good English sentence John is the subject Beat is the verb Mary is the object Good sentence Now we're going to move to the second sentence which says the same thing in the passive voice Mary was beaten by John And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence We've gone from John beat Mary to Mary was beaten by John We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence well close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain The third sentence John is dropped and we have Mary was beaten and now it's all about Mary We're not even thinking about John It's totally focused on Mary Over the past generation the term we've used synonymous with beaten is battered so we have Mary was battered And the final sentence in this sequence flowing from the others is Mary is a battered woman So now Mary's very identity -- Mary is a battered woman -- is what was done to her by John in the first instance But we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation Now those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim-blaming is pervasive in this realm which is to say blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it And we say things like why do these women go out with these men Why are they attracted to these men Why do they keep going back What was she wearing at that party What a stupid thing to do Why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room This is victim blaming and there are numerous reasons for it but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims This is all unconscious Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women's choices and what they're doing thinking and wearing And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women okay It's a legitimate thing to ask But's let's be clear: Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence We have to ask a different set of questions You can see where I'm going with this right The questions are not about Mary They're about John The questions include things like why does John beat Mary Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the United States and all over the world What's going on Why do so many men abuse that they claim to love What's going on with men Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys Why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America on and on and on And then local communities all over the country and all over the world right We hear about it all the time The sexual abuse of children What's going on with men Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world Why do so many men rape other men What is going on with men And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates Because this isn't about individual perpetrators That's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem You know the perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness That's a very naive notion right Perpetrators are much more normal than that So the question is what are we doing here What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men What's the role of religious belief systems the family structure economics and how that intersects and race and ethnicity and how that intersects How does all this work And then once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions then we can talk about how we can be transformative in other words how can we do something differently How can we change the practices How can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing but if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere we're not going to get to that piece Now I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues today and yesterday and for years and years often get shouted down for their efforts They get called nasty names like male-basher and man-hater and the disgusting and offensive feminazi Right And you know what all this is about It's called kill the messenger It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up keep the current system in place because we don't like it when people rock the boat We don't like it when people challenge our power You'd better sit down and shut up basically And thank goodness that women haven't done that Thank goodness that we live in a world where there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say or better yet we can be heard saying some things that women often can't be heard saying Now I appreciate that that's a problem It's sexism But it's the truth And so one of the things that I say to men and my colleagues and I always say this is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense We live in the world together And by the way one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow like I said that they're anti-male What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother themselves their sisters What about all those boys What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men's violence You know what The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men And if we want to talk about male victims let's talk about male victims Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence So that's something that both women and men have in common We are both victims of men's violence So we have it in our direct self-interest not to mention the fact that most men that I know have women and girls that we care deeply about in our families and our friendship circles and every other way So there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out It seems obvious saying it out loud Doesn't it Now the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the U。S military in schools we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach because it's a big thematic shift although there's lots of particulars but the heart of it is instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims or women as perpetrators men as victims or any combination in there I'm using the gender binary I know there's more than men and women there's more than male and female And there are women who are perpetrators and of course there are men who are victims There's a whole spectrum But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation so in other words friends teammates colleagues coworkers family members those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse but we are embedded in social family work school and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation What do we do How do we speak up How do we challenge our friends How do we support our friends But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse Now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are And when I say abusive I don't mean just men who are beating women is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack That's a naive way of creating a social change It's along a continuum we're trying to get men to interrupt each other So for example if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys playing poker talking hanging out no women present and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women instead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it we need men to say Hey that's not funny You know that could be my sister you're talking about and could you joke about something else Or could you talk about something else I don't appreciate that kind of talk Just like if you're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment you'd hope I hope that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person Just like with heterosexism if you're a heterosexual person and you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations if you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that then in a sense isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity Well the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable not just because it's illegal but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women as well as towards other boys and men will lose status as a result of it guess what We'll see a radical diminution of the abuse Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted He's a normal guy in every other way Isn't he Now among the many great things that Martin Luther King said in his short life was In the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends In the end what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence against women and children hasn't there There's been an awful lot of silence And all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence and we need more men to do that Now it's easier said than done because I'm saying it now but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues but they're also leadership issues for men Because ultimately the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men It should be on adult men with power Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts he or she is being a leader really right But on a big scale we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues and we haven't seen that yet have we Now I was at a dinner a number of years ago and I work extensively with the U。S military all the services And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me -- I think she thought she was a little clever -- she said So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines And I said With all due respect I don't do sensitivity training with the Marines I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps Now I know it's a bit pompous my response but it's an important distinction because I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training We need leadership training because for example when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team -- and I work extensively in that realm as well -- makes a sexist comment makes a homophobic statement makes a racist comment there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio And some people will say Well he needs sensitivity training And other people will say Well get off it You know that's political correctness run amok and he made a stupid statement Move on My argument is he doesn't need sensitivity training He needs leadership training because he's being a bad leader because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity -- and racial and ethnic diversity you make those kind of comments you're failing at your leadership If we can make this point that I'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power it's going to change it's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking You know for example I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence right There's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes coaches administrators as part of their educational process We know enough to know that we can easily do that But you know what's missing The leadership But it's not the leadership of student athletes It's the leadership of the athletic director the president of the university the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings That's a failure in most cases of men's leadership Look at Penn State Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach You had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children in this case boys It's unbelievable really But when you get into it you realize there are pressures on men There are constraints within peer cultures on men which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures And one of the ways to do that is to say there's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues I know this I work with men and I've been working with tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of men for many many decades now It's scary when you think about it how many years But there's so many men who care deeply about these issues but caring deeply is not enough We need more men with the guts with the courage with the strength with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them By the way we owe it to women There's no question about it But we also owe it to our sons We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way They didn't make the choice We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well I hope that going forward men and women working together can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis I know we can do it We can do better Thank you very much When we use the word architect or designer what we usually mean is a professional someone who gets paid and we tend to assume that it's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big systemic design challenges that we face like climate change urbanization and social inequality That's our kind of working presumption And I think it's wrong actually In 2008 I was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years and go out and get a job and this happened The economy ran out of jobs And a couple of things struck me about this One don't listen to career advisers And two actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture which is that as a society we've never needed design thinking more and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually there's an economics behind architecture that we don't talk about and I think we need to And a good place to start is your own paycheck So as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate I might expect to earn about 24，000 pounds That's about 36，000 37，000 dollars Now in terms of the whole world's population that already puts me in the top 1。95 richest people which raises the question of who is it I'm working for The uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world's population and it always has been The reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when actually the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent for various different reasons whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century communism in the early 20th the welfare state and most recently of course through this inflated real estate bubble And all of those booms in their own various ways have now kicked the bucket and we're back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy though I think it probably is it's actually not a very clever business strategy actually I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how are we going to turn our client from the one percent to the 100 percent And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done The first is I think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings Actually a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem And fundamentally design should be much much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions So here's a story The office was working with a school and they had an old Victorian school building And they said to the architects Look our corridors are an absolute nightmare They're far too small They get congested between classes There's bullying We can't control them So what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building and we know it's going to cost several million pounds but we're reconciled to the fact And the team thought about this and they went away and they said Actually don't do that Instead get rid of the school bell And instead of having one school bell that goes off once have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times distribute the traffic through the corridors It solves the same problem but instead of spending several million pounds you spend several hundred pounds Now it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job but you're not You're actually making yourself more useful Architects are actually really really good at this kind of resourceful strategic thinking And the problem is that like a lot of design professions we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing that mass architecture is about big -- big buildings and big finance Actually we've got ourselves locked into this Industrial Era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf procuring whole neighborhoods in single monolithic projects and of course form follows finance So what you end up with are single monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model And a lot of people can't even afford them But what if actually it's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit And when they do they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live And it raises really interesting questions about how will we plan cities How will finance development How will we sell design services What would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build And in a way it should be kind of obvious right that in the 21st century maybe cities can be developed by citizens And thirdly we need to remember that from a strictly economic point of view design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly -- mostly it's done by amateurs And that's a good thing Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what's called the social economy or the core economy which is people doing it for themselves And the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools So the challenge we face is how are we going to build the tools the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture's social economy And that began with open-source software And over the last few years it's been moving into the physical world with open-source hardware which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves And that's where 3D printing gets really really interesting Right When suddenly you had a 3D printer that was open-source the parts for which could be made on another 3D printer Or the same idea here which is for a CNC machine which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood What these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill They're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all And they're distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone That really is an industrial revolution And when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production and these technologies are coming back with a solution: actually maybe no one All of us And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture So about a year and a half ago we started working on a project called WikiHouse and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online access a freely shared library of 3D models which they can download and adapt in at the moment SketchUp because it's free and it's easy to use and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them in effect to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine and a standard sheet material like plywood And the parts are all numbered and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit And it goes together without any bolts It uses wedge and peg connections And even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well And a team of about two or three people working together can build this They don't need any traditional construction skills They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what's cheap and what's available Of course the house is never finished We're shifting our heads here so the house is not a finished product With the CNC machine you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source citizen-led urban development model potentially And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now and some really interesting lessons here One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable People get confused between construction work and having fun But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details Like never designing a piece that can't be lifted up Or when you're designing a piece make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round or if you do it doesn't matter because it's symmetrical Probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds the open-source pioneer which was that idea of Be lazy like a fox Don't reinvent the wheel every time Take what already works and adapt it for your own needs Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school copying is good Which is appropriate because actually this approach is not innovative It's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution in these sorts of community barn-raisings The only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open-source architecture might be a web connection but it's a really really big difference We shared the whole of WikiHouse under a Creative Commons license and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it and it's amazing There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand looking at post-earthquake development housing and thanks to the TED city Prize we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas to set up a kind of community factory and micro-university These are very very small beginnings and actually there's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they're not even on this map I hope next time you see it you won't even be able to see the map We're aware that WikiHouse is a very very small answer but it's a small answer to a really really big question which is that globally right now the fastest-growing cities are not skyscraper cities They're self-made cities in one form or another If we're talking about the 21st-century city these are the guys who are going to be making it You know like it or not welcome to the world's biggest design team So if we're serious about problems like climate change urbanization and health actually our existing development models aren't going to do it As I think Robert Neuwirth said there isn't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers How extraordinary would it be though if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning off-grid energy off-grid sanitation -- low-cost open-source high-performance solutions that anyone can very very easily make and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone A kind of Wikipedia for stuff And once something's in the commons it will always be there How much would that change the rules And I think the technology's on our side If design's great project in the 20th century was the democratization of consumption -- that was Henry Ford Levittown Coca-Cola IKEA I think design's great project in the 21st century is the democratization of production And when it comes to architecture in cities that really matters Thank you very much Hey guys It's funny someone just mentioned MacGyver because that was like I loved it and when I was seven I taped a fork to a drill and I was like Hey Mom I'm going to Olive Garden And -- And it worked really well there And you know it had a profound effect on me It sounds silly but I thought okay the way the world works can be changed and it can be changed by me in these small ways And my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this well I can say they work a different way a little bit And so about 20 years later I didn't realize the full effect of this but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them and they could make beds out of trees and they could -- I watched this woman for three days I was there She was peeling this palm frond apart these little threads off of it and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads like strings and she would weave the strings together and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days the materiality of the way the world works of reality kind of started to unravel in my mind because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to maybe a more complicated one but still everything was made that way And so I had to start studying who is it that's making these decisions Who's making these things How did they make them What stops us from making them Because this is how reality is created So I started right away I was at MIT Media Lab and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity And I started in nature because I saw these Guaymís doing it in nature and there just seems to be less barriers So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything So I said Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together you know make something I don't care geometrical shapes just grab some junk from around you We won't bring anything with us And like within minutes this is very easy for adults and teens to do Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it And after about 45 minutes you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath And the creator of this he said This is fire I call this fire And someone asked him How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree And he's like I don't know but I can show you And I'm like Wow that's really amazing He doesn't know but he can show you So his hands know and his intuition knows but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be especially when it comes to the human-made human-built world We think we already know how something works so we can't imagine how it could work We know how it's supposed to work so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible So kids don't have as hard of a time with this and I saw in my own son I gave him this book I'm a good hippie dad so I'm like Okay you're going to learn to love the moon I'm going to give you some building blocks and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks so it's totally legit But he doesn't really know what to do with these I didn't show him And so he's like Okay I'll just mess around with this This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff And before long he's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around and he enlists us in helping him And at this point I'm starting to wonder what kind of tools can we give people especially adults who know too much so that they can see the world as malleable so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works pushing what matter can do the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium and any sufficiently complicated task whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child -- anything that's complicated -- comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say Okay well we're just going to have to refigure this I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing I'm going to use them a different way So let me show you a little demo This is a little piano circuit right in here and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with And so with some ketchup and then I can kind of And that's awesome right But this is not what's awesome What's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people A pencil is not just a pencil Look what it has in the middle of it That's a wire running down the middle and not only is it a wire if you take that piano circuit you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil and you can lay out wire on the page too and get electrical current to run through it And so you can kind of hack a pencil And the electricity runs through your body too You can make one of these brushes just on the fly All you do is connect to the bristles and the bristles are wet so they conduct and the person's body conducts and leather is great to paint on and then you can start hooking to everything even the kitchen sink The metal in the sink is conductive Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin And you can even hook to the trees Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive and you can use those together So I took this to those same teens because those teens are really awesome and they'll try things that I won't try I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to And this young woman she made what she called a hula-looper and as the hula hoop traveled around her body she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there You can see her pointing to it in the picture And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body it would connect two little pieces of copper tape and it would make a sound and the next sound and it would loop the same sounds over and over again I ran these workshops everywhere In Taiwan at an art museum this 12-year-old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump were inviting me to give workshops just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over And so I just want to do a quick demo So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you So I'll just plug it in and now it's on by USB And I'll just hook up the forward arrow You guys are facing that way so I'll hook it to this one And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it And now if I touch this piece of pizza the slides that I showed you before should go forward And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up now I have a left arrow and a right arrow so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards Awesome And so we're like We gotta put a video out about this Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and like one other guy So we made a video to prove that there's lots of stuff you can do You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh and just Google for game controllers Just ordinary Play-Doh nothing special And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target Well if you take those out they hold water great but you can totally cut your toes so yeah just be careful You know the Happiness Project where the experts are setting up the piano stairs and how cool that is Well I think it's cool but we should be doing that stuff ourselves It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together Aluminum foil Everybody has a cat Get a bowl of water This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS Hover the mouse over the take a photo button and you've got a little cat photo booth And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this And so we put it up on Kickstarter and hundreds of people bought it in the first day And then 30 days later 11，000 people had backed the project And then what the best part is we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it So this is The Star-Spangled Banner by eating lunch including drinking Listerine And we actually sent this guy materials You're like a pro maker Okay just wait for this one This is good And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways And then this brother -- look at this diagram See where it says sister I love when people put humans on the diagram I always add humans to any technical -- if you're drawing a technical diagram put a human in it And this kid is so sweet He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday she could be the star of the show jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano And this is fun and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun But it's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up where people can't use computers necessarily Like this dad who wrote us his son has cerebral palsy and he can't use a normal keyboard And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers And so with the MaKey MaKey he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came and we're really excited about that We didn't plan for that at all And then all these professional musicians started using it like at Coachella just this weekend Jurassic 5 was using this onstage and this D。J is just from Brooklyn right around here and he put this up last month And I love the carrot on the turntable Most people cannot play them that way And when this started to get serious I thought I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change and governments will be crumbling and I wouldn't have told people so I thought I'd better warn them And I also put this little surprise When you open the lid of the box it says The world is a construction kit And as you start to mess around this way I think that in some small ways you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M&amp;M by accident you know maybe that's an M&amp;M surfboard not an escalator so don't pick it up right away Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down and maybe some chapstick whatever I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that But as I'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands each following their own passions and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens And that's the world I really want to live in Thank you That's how we traveled in the year 1900 That's an open buggy It doesn't have heating It doesn't have air conditioning That horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains That's a Boeing 707 Only 60 years later it travels at 80 percent of the speed of sound and we don't travel any faster today because commercial supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust So I started wondering and pondering could it be that the best years of American economic growth are behind us And that leads to the suggestion maybe economic growth is almost over Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial There are four headwinds that are just hitting the American economy in the face They're demographics education debt and inequality They're powerful enough to cut growth in half So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years growth is cut in half If innovation is less powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history Now here's eight centuries of economic growth The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth zero percent a year one percent a year two percent a year The white line is for the U。K。 and then the U。S takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900 when the line switches to red You'll notice that for the first four centuries there's hardly any growth at all just 0。2 percent Then growth gets better and better It maxes out in the 1930s '40s and '50s and then it starts slowing down and here's a cautionary note That last downward notch in the red line is not actual data That is a forecast that I made six years ago that growth would slow down to 1。3 percent But you know what the actual facts are You know what the growth in per-person income has been in the United States in the last six years Negative This led to a fantasy What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted but I decided I would end it at 0。2 just like the U。K growth for the first four centuries Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown at 2。0 percent per year over the whole period 1891 to 2007 and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007 But if growth slows down instead of doubling our standard of living every generation Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents or even a quarter more well off than their parents Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices You'll notice that in 1891 over on the left we were at about 5，000 dollars Today we're at about 44，000 dollars of total output per member of the population Now what if we could achieve that historic two-percent growth for the next 70 years Well it's a matter of arithmetic Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years That means we'd go from 44，000 to 180，000 Well we're not going to do that and the reason is the headwinds The first headwind is demographics It's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour if hours per person increased And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s when women entered the labor force But now it's turned around Now hours per person are shrinking first because of the retirement of the baby boomers and second because there's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution The next headwind is education We've got problems all over our educational system despite Race to the Top In college we've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt and our college completion rate is 15 points 15 percentage points below Canada We have a lot of debt Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007 on the back of consumers massively overborrowing Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today And everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate and the only way that's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements also called transfer payments And that gets us down from the 1。5 where we've reached for education down to 1。3 And then we have inequality Over the 15 years before the financial crisis the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we've been talking about before All the rest went to the top one percent So that brings us down to 0。8 And that 0。8 is the big challenge Are we going to grow at 0。8 If so that's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last 150 years So let's see what some of those inventions were If you wanted to read in 1875 at night you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp They created pollution they created odors they were hard to control the light was dim and they were a fire hazard By 1929 electric light was everywhere We had the vertical city the invention of the elevator Central Manhattan became possible And then in addition to that at the same time hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand-powered electric tools all achieved by electricity Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women Women back in the late 19th century spent two days a week doing the laundry They did it on a scrub board Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry Then they had to bring them in The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week And then we had the electric washing machine And by 1950 they were everywhere But the women still had to shop every day but no they didn't because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator Back in the late 19th century the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating The bedrooms were cold They were unheated But by 1929 certainly by 1950 we had central heating everywhere What about the internal combustion engine which was invented in 1879 In America before the motor vehicle transportation depended entirely on the urban horse which dropped without restraint 25 to 50 pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine That comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses Of course when the motor vehicle was invented and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929 that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900 only 30 years later the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years Back before the turn of the century women had another problem All the water for cooking cleaning and bathing had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside It's a historical fact that in 1885 the average North Carolina housewife walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water But by 1929 cities around the country had put in underground water pipes They had put in underground sewer pipes and as a result one of the great scourges of the late 19th century waterborne diseases like cholera began to disappear And an amazing fact for techno-optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves And I'll just give you a few examples We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound Electrification central heat ownership of motor cars they all went from zero to 100 percent Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent What about the electronic revolution Here's an early computer It's amazing The mainframe computer was invented in 1942 By 1960 we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers The earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s The 1980s brought us Bill Gates DOS ATM machines to replace bank tellers bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector Fast forward through the '90s we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth But I'm now going to give you an experiment You have to choose either option A or option B Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago So you get Google you get Amazon you get Wikipedia and you get running water and indoor toilets Or you get everything invented to yesterday but you have to give up go out to the outhouse and carry in the water Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century maybe for a couple of days in some cases for more than a week electricity running water heating gasoline for their cars and a charge for their iPhones The problem we face is that all these great inventions we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we're not going to match them brings us down from the original two-percent growth down to 0。2 the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning So here we are back to the horse and buggy I'd like to award an Oscar to the inventors of the 20th century to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers I'd like to call them all up here and they're going to call back to you Your challenge is can you match what we achieved Thank you One of the things I want to establish right from the start is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots I just wanted you to know that So I am indeed a neurosurgeon and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery and what I'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients So as I said neurosurgery comes from a long tradition It's been around for about 7，000 years In Mesoamerica there used to be neurosurgery and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients And they were trying to -- they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease They didn't know exactly what they were doing Not much has changed by the way But they thought that if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit So if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems then the way to treat this is of course to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape So this was the thinking back then and these individuals made these holes Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because you can tell that the holes are made partially and then I think there was some trepanation and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial hole and we know they survived these procedures But this was common There were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common and it was also quite common about 7，000 years ago Now in the course of time we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite and so on And when things work well then the nervous system works well and everything functions But once in a while things don't go so well and there's trouble in these circuits and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring and causing trouble or sometimes they're underactive and they're not quite working as they should Now the manifestation of this depends on where in the brain these neurons are So when these neurons are in the motor circuit you get dysfunction in the movement system and you get things like Parkinson's disease When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood you get things like depression and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function then you get things like Alzheimer's disease So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial Once you choose the right station whether it be jazz or opera in our case whether it be movement or mood we can put the dial there and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume to turn it up or turn it down So what I'm going to tell you about is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes and turning areas of the brain up and down to see if we can help our patients And this is accomplished using this kind of device and this is called deep brain stimulation So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain Again we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime putting an electrode in and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest and with a remote control very much like a television remote control we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain We can turn it up or down on or off Now about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation and I'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement disorders of mood and disorders of cognition So this looks something like this when it's in the brain You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there and we can place this really anywhere in the brain I tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient with Parkinson's disease and this lady has Parkinson's disease and she has these electrodes in her brain and I'm going to show you what she's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms and then we're going to turn it on So this looks something like this The electrodes are turned off now and you can see that she has tremor Okay I can't Can you try to touch my finger That's a little better That side is better We're now going to turn it on It's on Just turned it on And this works like that instantly And the difference between shaking in this way and not -- The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of 25，000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus So we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them Gentlemen that's enough We want you to stop doing that And we do that with electricity So we use electricity to dictate how they fire and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity So in this case we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons We started using this technique in other problems and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered a case of dystonia So dystonia is a disorder affecting children It's a genetic disorder and it involves a twisting motion and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can't breathe until they get sores urinary infections and then they die So back in 1997 I was asked to see this young boy perfectly normal He has this genetic form of dystonia There are eight children in the family Five of them have dystonia So here he is This boy is nine years old perfectly normal until the age six and then he started twisting his body first the right foot then the left foot then the right arm then the left arm then the trunk and then by the time he arrived within the course of one or two years of the disease onset he could no longer walk he could no longer stand He was crippled and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted progressively disabled and many of these children do not survive So he is one of five kids The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this He did not respond to any drugs We did not know what to do with this boy We did not know what operation to do where to go in the brain but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease we reasoned why don't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we suppressed in Parkinson's disease and let's see what happens So here he was We operated on him hoping that he would get better We did not know So here he is now back in Israel where he lives three months after the procedure and here he is On the basis of this result this is now a procedure that's done throughout the world and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery This boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life This has been one of the most satisfying cases that I have ever done in my entire career to restore movement and walking to this kind of child We realized that perhaps we could use this technology not only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood And we decided to take on depression and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent and as you know there are many treatments for depression with medication and psychotherapy even electroconvulsive therapy but there are millions of people and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression that do not respond and it is these patients that we want to help And let's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression So the first thing we did was we compared what's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals areas of the brain are shut down and those are the areas in blue So here you really have the blues and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation in drive and decision-making and indeed if you're severely depressed as these patients were those are impaired You lack motivation and drive The other thing we discovered was an area that was overactive area 25 seen there in red and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain If I make any of you sad for example I make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died this area of the brain lights up It is the sadness center of the brain And so patients with depression have hyperactivity The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot The thermostat is set at 100 degrees and the other areas of the brain involved in drive and motivation are shut down So we wondered can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat can we turn down the activity and what will be the consequence of that So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory And we placed electrodes in area 25 area 25 the sadness area is red hot and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue and then after three months of continuous stimulation 24 hours a day or six months of continuous stimulation we have a complete reversal of this We're able to drive down area 25 down to a more normal level and we're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain and indeed we're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression So now we are in clinical trials and are in Phase III clinical trials and this may become a new procedure if it's safe and we find that it's effective to treat patients with severe depression I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to treat the motor system in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter Anybody interested in that Of course we can right we're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain We're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity Now we're not going to do this in normal people We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits As you know this is the main symptom of early onset Alzheimer's disease So we've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit and whether that can in turn help these patients with Alzheimer's disease Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose It uses 20 percent of all your -- even though it only weighs two percent -- it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain and as you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment which is a precursor for Alzheimer's all the way to Alzheimer's disease then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose They shut down They turn off And indeed what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely This is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain a regional power failure So the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease and the question is are the lights out forever or can we turn the lights back on Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again So this is what we did We implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with Alzheimer's disease we turned it on and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain And indeed at the top you'll see before the surgery the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes These areas of the brain are shut down The lights are out in these areas of the brain We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month or a year and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization And indeed we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again So the message here is that in Alzheimer's disease the lights are out but there is someone home and we're able to turn the power back on to these areas of the brain and as we do so we expect that their functions will return So this is now in clinical trials We are going to operate on 50 patients with early Alzheimer's disease to see whether this is safe and effective whether we can improve their neurologic function So the message I want to leave you with today is that indeed there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease depression schizophrenia Alzheimer's We are now learning to understand what are the circuits what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases We can now reach those circuits We can introduce electrodes within those circuits We can graduate the activity of those circuits We can turn them down if they are overactive if they're causing trouble trouble that is felt throughout the brain or we can turn them up if they are underperforming and in so doing we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain The implications of this of course is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity and this is something for the future to see if indeed we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain One of the most exciting things about this is that indeed it involves multidisciplinary work It involves the work of engineers of imaging scientists of basic scientists of neurologists psychiatrists neurosurgeons and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement And I think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on and the consequence of that of course will be that we will be able to help many more patients Thank you very much Elon what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car Elon Musk: Well it goes back to when I was in university I thought about what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century independent of environmental concerns In fact even if producing CO2 was good for the environment given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons we need to find some sustainable means of operating Most of American electricity comes from burning fossil fuels How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help EM: Right There's two elements to that answer One is that even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars you're still better off So if you take say natural gas which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine you'll get about 60 percent efficiency If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car you get about 20 percent efficiency And the reason is in the stationary power plant you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more is voluminous and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source So in effect even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything even using the same source fuel you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car then burning it at the power plant That scale delivers efficiency EM: Yes it does And then the other point is we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway electricity generation then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport So we've got some video here of the Tesla being assembled which if we could play that first video -- So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle EM: Sure So in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport and I should say that I think actually all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets There's just no way around Newton's third law The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport And in order to do that for cars you have to come up with a really energy efficient car so that means making it incredibly light and so what you're seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in North America In fact we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size So as a result the energy usage is very low and it has the most advanced battery pack and that's what gives it the range that's competitive so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range I mean those battery packs are incredibly heavy but you think the math can still work out intelligently -- by combining light body heavy battery you can still gain spectacular efficiency EM: Exactly The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range And in fact customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge Bruno Bowden who's here did that broke the world record。EM: Congratulations That was the good news The bad news was that to do it he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops EM: I mean you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour under normal conditions 250 miles is a reasonable number Let's show that second video showing the Tesla in action on ice Not at all a dig at The New York Times this by the way What is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car EM: In creating an electric car the responsiveness of the car is really incredible So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one and as you corner and accelerate it just happens You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness You can't do that with a gasoline car I think that's really a profound difference and people only experience that when they have a test drive I mean this is a beautiful but expensive car Is there a road map where this becomes a mass-market vehicle EM: Yeah The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three-step process where version one was an expensive car at low volume version two is medium priced and medium volume and then version three would be low price high volume So we're at step two at this point So we had a $100，000 sports car which was the Roadster Then we've got the Model S which starts at around 50，000 dollars And our third generation car which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $30，000 car But whenever you've got really new technology it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product And so I think we're making progress in that direction and I feel confident that we'll get there I mean right now if you've got a short commute you can drive you can get back you can charge it at home There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast Do you see that coming really truly or just on a few key routes EM: There actually are far more charging stations than people realize and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free forever We actually have California and Nevada covered and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D。C covered By the end of this year you'll be able to drive from L。A to New York just using the Supercharger network which charges at five times the rate of anything else And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop to stop time of about six or seven So if you drive for three hours you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes because that's normally what people will stop for So if you start a trip at 9 a。m。 by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat hit the restroom coffee and keep going So your proposition to consumers is for the full charge it could take an hour So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes Wait for an hour but the good news is you're helping save the planet and by the way the electricity is free You don't pay anything EM: Actually what we're expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes not for an hour It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going That's the natural cadence of a trip All right So this is only one string to your energy bow You've been working on this solar company SolarCity What's unusual about that EM: Well as I mentioned earlier we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar I mean it's really indirect fusion is what it is We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already If the sun wasn't there we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation The whole ecosystem is solar-powered But in a gallon of gasoline you have effectively thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar and to remotely compete with for example natural gas fracked natural gas How are you going to build a business here EM: Well actually I'm confident that solar will beat everything hands down including natural gas How EM: It must actually If it doesn't we're in deep trouble But you're not selling solar panels to consumers What are you doing EM: No we actually are You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system Most people choose to lease And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs so once it's installed it's just there It works for decades It'll work for probably a century So therefore the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low and then get the cost of the financing low because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar And we've made huge progress in that direction and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas So your current proposition to consumers is don't pay so much up front EM: Zero Pay zero up front We will install panels on your roof You will then pay how long is a typical lease EM: Typical leases are 20 years but the value proposition is as you're sort of alluding to quite straightforward It's no money down and your utility bill decreases Pretty good deal So that seems like a win for the consumer No risk you'll pay less than you're paying now For you the dream here then is that -- I mean who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term I mean how do you the company benefit EM: Well essentially SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say a company or a bank Google is one of our big partners here And they have an expected return on that capital With that capital SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment which is less than the utility bill But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility EM: Exactly What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility I think it's a good thing because utilities have been this monopoly and people haven't had any choice So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines but now it's on your roof So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses And you really picture a future where a majority of power in America within a decade or two or within your lifetime it goes solar EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power and most likely a majority and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years I made that bet with someone Definition of plurality is EM: More from solar than any other source Ah Who did you make the bet with EM: With a friend who will remain nameless Just between us EM: I made that bet I think two or three years ago so in roughly 18 years I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source All right so let's go back to another bet that you made with yourself I guess a kind of crazy bet You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal You decided to build a space company Why on Earth would someone do that EM: I got that question a lot that's true People would say Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry Obviously He started with a large one is the punchline And so I tell people well I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one And they'd look at me like Is he serious And strangely you were So what happened EM: It was a close call Things almost didn't work out We came very close to failure but we managed to get through that point in 2008 The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket Would humanity become a space-faring civilization So that was a dream of yours in a way from a young age You've dreamed of Mars and beyond EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid but I didn't think I'd be involved in this It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one And I really think there's a fundamental difference if you sort of look into the future between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization that's out there exploring the stars on multiple planets and I think that's really exciting compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event So you've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent depending on how you calculate it How on Earth have you done that NASA has been doing this for years How have you done this EM: Well we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe the engines the electronics and the launch operation There's a long list of innovations that we've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk but -- Not least because you could still get copied right You haven't patented this stuff It's really interesting to me EM: No we don't patent You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments the enforceability of patents is questionable That's really really interesting But the big innovation is still ahead and you're working on it now Tell us about this EM: Right so the big innovation— In fact let's roll that video and you can talk us through it what's happening here EM: Absolutely So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable All rockets that fly today are fully expendable The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time and the parts that were reusable took a 10，000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight Obviously that doesn't work very well for What just happened there We just saw something land EM: That's right So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours Wow Reusable rockets。EM: Yes And so what a lot of people don't realize is the cost of the fuel of the propellant is very small It's much like on a jet So the cost of the propellant is about 。3 percent of the cost of the rocket So it's possible to achieve let's say roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket That's why it's so important Every mode of transport that we use whether it's planes trains automobiles bikes horses is reusable but not rockets So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization You asked me the question earlier if you had to burn your ships afterward。EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic Definitely more expensive So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology and I guess paves the way for your dream to actually take at some point to take humanity to Mars at scale You'd like to see a colony on Mars EM: Yeah exactly SpaceX or some combination of companies and governments needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi-planetary of establishing a base on another planet on Mars -- being the only realistic option -- and then building that base up until we're a true multi-planet species So progress on this let's make it reusable how is that going That was just a simulation video we saw How's it going EM: We're actually we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky And we've had some good tests Can we see that？EM: Yeah So that's just to give a sense of scale We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket All right let's see that video then because this is actually amazing when you think about it You've never seen this before A rocket blasting off and then -- EM: Yeah so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building So now it's hovering at about 40 meters and it's constantly adjusting the angle the pitch and yaw of the main engine and maintaining roll with coal gas thrusters How cool is that Elon how have you done this These projects are so -- Paypal SolarCity Tesla SpaceX they're so spectacularly different they're such ambitious projects at scale How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way What is it about you EM: I don't know actually I don't have a good answer for you I work a lot I mean a lot Well I have a theory。EM: Okay All right My theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design technology and business so if TED was TBD design technology and business into one package synthesize it in a way that very few people can and -- and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks You bet your fortune on it and you seem to have done that multiple times I mean almost no one can do that Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce Can we put it into our education system Can someone learn from you It is truly amazing what you've done EM: Well thanks Thank you Well I do think there's a good framework for thinking It is physics You know the sort of first principles reasoning Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there as opposed to reasoning by analogy Through most of our life we get through life by reasoning by analogy which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations And you have to do that Otherwise mentally you wouldn't be able to get through the day But when you want to do something new you have to apply the physics approach Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive like quantum mechanics It's really counterintuitive So I think that's an important thing to do and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it particularly from friends This may sound like simple advice but hardly anyone does that and it's incredibly helpful Boys and girls watching study physics Learn from this man Elon Musk I wish we had all day but thank you so much for coming to TED EM: Thank you That was awesome That was really really cool Look at that Just take a bow That was fantastic Thank you so much So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do as we're walking around being able to point a phone at anything and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas Well traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we've moved to a world where actually this has become possible So the best way of explaining it is to just show it What you can see over here is Tamara who is holding my phone that's now plugged in So let me start with this What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes 。。 Matt Mills: Now what's great about this is there's no trickery here There's nothing done to this image And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does Not only that but as I move the object around it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly Again the thing that's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become All the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself Now this has applications everywhere whether in things like art in museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed And here is this morning's newspaper and we have some Wimbledon news which is great Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin Voice: 。。 To the grass and it's very important that you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split second and she does all that She's won this title MM: And that linking of the digital content to something that's physical is what we call an aura and I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk So what's great about this is it isn't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible So what I have here is a wireless router My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router so that everyone here understands but nonetheless here is the device So now what I can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online I can simply point at it the device is recognized and then -- Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable Then connect the power Finally the yellow ethernet cable Congratulations You have now completed setup MM: Awesome Thank you The incredible work that made that possible was done here in the U。K by scientists at Cambridge and they work in our offices and I've got a lovely picture of them here They couldn't all be on stage but we're going to bring their aura to the stage so here they are They're not very animated This was the fourth take I'm told Okay So as we're talking about Cambridge let's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate and that means that I can now take cinema-quality 3D models and place them in the world around me so I have one over here Tamara would you like to jump in MM: I should leap in So then after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world What's great about this is the tools to do this are free They're open they're available to everyone within our application and educators have really got on board with the classrooms So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks teachers who've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this is a school in the U。K I have a picture here from a video and we're now going to play it Teacher: See what happens Keep going TV Oh my God Teacher: Now move it either side See what happens Move away from it and come back to it Oh that is so cool Teacher: And then have you got it again Oh my God How did you do that Second child: It's magic MM: So it's not magic It's available for everyone to do and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now So as sort of I'm told it's called a stadium wave so we're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here Tamara are you recording Okay so are you all ready One two three Go Audience: Whooooooo MM: Fellows are really good at that Okay Now we're going to switch back into the Aurasma application and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge so that I can remember it forever Now we have lots of people who are doing this already and we've talked a little bit about the educational side On the emotional side we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them We have people who have for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more you can point and discover the information We're all very very familiar with the Internet In the last 20 years it's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world and what's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift because now we can literally take the content that we share we discover and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us It's completely free to download this application If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G this process is very very quick Oh there we are We can save it now It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint and the great thing is if you're a professional user -- so a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we've just used to create this demonstration The only difference is that you've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content Are you now ready Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go MM: Okay So I'm told we're ready which means we can now point at the image and there you all are MM on One two three Go MM: Well done We've been Aurasma Thank you So I thought I'd talk about identity That's sort of an interesting enough topic to me And the reason was because when I was asked to do this I'd just read in one of the papers I can't remember something from someone at Facebook saying well we need to make everybody use their real names and then that's basically all the problems solved And that's so wrong that's such a fundamentally reactionary view of identity and it's going to get us into all sorts of trouble And so what I thought I'd do is I'll explain four sort of problems about it and then I'll suggest a solution which hopefully you might find interesting So just to frame the problem what does authenticity mean That's me that's a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting What's the Problem That's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger and because I'm not very good at presentations I already can't remember the name that I wrote on my card And he was incarcerated in I think Wakefield Prison for forging masterpieces by I think French Impressionists And he's so good at it that when he was in prison everybody in prison the governor and whatever wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls because they were so good And so that's a masterpiece which is a fake of a masterpiece and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake if you see what I mean So when we're talking about authenticity it's a little more fractal than it appears and that's a good example to show it I tried to pick four problems that will frame the issue properly So the first problem I thought Chip and PIN right Banking legacies bringing down the system from within Offline solutions do not work online I'm guessing everyone's got a chip and PIN card right So why is that a good example That's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a well-constructed system That chip and PIN card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop is extremely secure you can put scanning electron microscopes on it you can try and grind it down blah blah blah Those chips have never been broken whatever you read in the paper And for a joke we take that super-secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe and for very lazy criminals we still emboss the card So if you're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone's card you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up And even more amusingly and on my debit card too we print the name and the SALT code and everything else on the front too Why There is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and PIN card And if you think about it it's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first Because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card are criminals You know what your name is right And when you go into a shop and buy something it's a PIN he doesn't care what the name is The only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in America at the moment And whenever I go to America and I have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway just as a security mechanism because if a transaction ever gets disputed and it comes back and it says Dave Birch I know it must have been a criminal because I would never sign it Dave Birch So if you drop your card in the street it means a criminal can pick it up and read it They know the name from the name they can find the address and then they can go off and buy stuff online Why do we put the name on the card Because we think identity is something to do with names and because we're rooted in the idea of the identity card which obsesses us And I know it crashed and burned a couple of years ago but if you're someone in politics or the home office or whatever and you think about identity you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them And that's very subversive in a modern world So the second example I thought I'd use is chatrooms Chatrooms and Children I'm very proud of that picture that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first-ever gig I believe you call it where he got paid And I love that picture I like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better I like that picture for the moment Why do I use that picture Because that was very interesting watching that experience as an old person So him and his friends and they got all their friends who had bands and they got them together and they do it all on Facebook and then they sell tickets and the first band on the I was going to say menu that's probably the wrong word for it isn't it The first band on the list of bands that appears at some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first 20 tickets then the next band gets the next 20 They were at the bottom of the menu they were like fifth I thought they had no chance He actually got 20 quid Fantastic right But my point is that all worked perfectly except on the web So they're sitting on Facebook and they're sending these messages and arranging things and they don't know who anybody is right That's the big problem we're trying to solve If only they were using the real names Then you wouldn't be worried about them on the internet And so when he says to me oh I want to go to a chatroom to talk about guitars or something I'm like oh well I don't want you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars because they might not all be your friends and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be perverts and teachers and vicars I mean they generally are when you look in the paper right So I want to know who all the people in the chatroom are So okay you can go in the chatroom but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names and they submit full copies of their police report But of course if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name I'd say no You can't give them your real name Because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever So you have this odd sort of paradox where I'm happy for him to go into this space if I know who everybody else is but I don't want anybody else to know who he is And so you get this sort of logjam around identity where you want full disclosure from everybody else but not from yourself And there's no progress we get stuck And so the chatroom thing doesn't work properly and it's a very bad way of thinking about identity So on my RSS feed I saw this thing about I just said something bad about my RSS feed didn't I I should stop saying it like that For some random reason I can't imagine something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox And I read this story about cheerleaders and it's a fascinating story This happened a couple of years ago in the U。S There were some cheerleaders in a team at a high school in the U。S。 and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach as I'm sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this She was very upset And so she went to one of the girls and said you have to give me your Facebook password I read this all the time where even at some universities and places of education kids are forced to hand over their Facebook passwords So you've got to give them your Facebook password She was a kid What she should have said is my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning It's an outrageous imposition on my 4th Amendment right to privacy and you're going to be sued for all the money you've got That's what she should have said But she's a kid so she hands over the password The teacher can't log into Facebook because the school has blocked access to Facebook So the teacher can't log into Facebook until she gets home So the girl tells her friends guess what happened The teacher logged in she knows So the girls just all logged into Facebook on their phones and deleted their profiles And so when the teacher logged in there was nothing there My point is those identities they don't think about them the same way Identity is especially when you're a teenager a fluid thing You have lots of identities And you can have an identity you don't like it because it's subverted in some way or it's insecure or it's inappropriate you just delete it and get another one The idea that you have an identity that's given to you by someone the government or whatever and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places that's absolutely wrong Why would you want to really know who someone was on Facebook unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way And it just doesn't work properly And my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to be In case you're wondering that's me at the G20 protest I wasn't actually at the G20 protest but I had a meeting at a bank on the day of the G20 protest and I got an email from the bank saying please don't wear a suit because it'll inflame the protestors I look pretty good in a suit frankly so you can see why it would drive them into an anti-capitalist frenzy So I thought well look If I don't want to inflame the protestors the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protestor So I went dressed completely in black you know with a black balaclava I had black gloves on but I've taken them off to sign the visitor's book I'm wearing black trousers black boots I'm dressed completely in black I go into the bank at 10 o'clock go Hi I'm Dave Birch I've got a 3 o'clock with so and so there Sure They sign me in There's my visitor's badge So this nonsense about you've got to have real names on Facebook and whatever that gets you that kind of security That gets you security theater where there's no actual security but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security And as long as everybody learns their lines everyone's happy But it's not real security Especially because I hate banks more than the G20 protestors do because I work for them I know that things are actually worse than these guys think But suppose I worked next to somebody in a bank who was doing something Suppose I was sitting next to a rogue trader and I want to report it to the boss of the bank So I log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing I send a message this guy's a rogue trader That message is meaningless if you don't know that I'm a trader at the bank If that message just comes from anybody it has zero information value There's no point in sending that message But if I have to prove who I am I'll never send that message It's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the drunk surgeon That message will only happen if I'm anonymous So the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there otherwise we don't get where we want to get to So four issues So what are we going to do about it Well what we tend to do about it is we think about Orwell space And we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of in 1953 So we think if we had a card call it a Facebook login which proves who you are and I make you carry it all the time that solves the problem And of course for all those reasons I've just outlined it doesn't and it might actually make some problems worse The more times you're forced to use your real identity certainly in transactional terms the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted The goal is to stop people from using identity in transactions which don't need identity which is actually almost all transactions Almost all of the transactions you do are not who are you They're are you allowed to drive the car are you allowed in the building are you over 18 etcetera etcetera So my suggestion- I like James think that there should be a resurgence of interest in R &amp; D I think this is a solvable problem It's something we can do about Naturally in these circumstances I turn to Doctor Who Because in this as in so many other walks of life Doctor Who has already shown us the answer So I should say for some of our foreign visitors Doctor Who is the greatest living scientist in England and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us And this is Doctor Who with his psychic paper Come on you guys must have seen Doctor Who's psychic paper You're not nerds if you say yes Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper Oh right you were in the library the whole time studying I guess Is that what you're going to tell us Doctor Who's psychic paper is when you hold up the psychic paper the person in their brain sees the thing that they need to see So I want to show you a British passport I hold up the psychic paper you see a British passport I want to get into a party I hold up the psychic paper I show you a party invitation You see what you want to see So what I'm saying is we need to make an electronic version of that but with one tiny tiny change which is that it'll only show you the British passport if I've actually got one It'll only show you the party invitation if I actually have one It will only show you that I'm over 18 if I actually am over 18 But nothing else So you're the bouncer at the pub you need to know that I'm over 18 instead of showing you my driving license which shows you I know how to drive what my name is my address all these kind of things I show you my psychic paper and all it tells you is am I over 18 or not Right Is that just a pipe dream Of course not otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you So in order to build that and make it work I'm only going to name these things I'll not go into them we need a plan which is we're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use to solve all of these problems We're going to make a utility the utility has to be universal you can use it everywhere I'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along That's a Japanese ATM the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone So when you want to draw money out you put the mobile phone on the ATM and touch your finger your fingerprint goes through to the phone the phone says yes that's whoever and the ATM then gives you some money It has to be a utility that you can use everywhere It has to be absolutely convenient that's me going into the pub All the device on the door of the pub is allowed is is this person over 18 and not barred from the pub And so the idea is you touch your ID card to the door and if I am allowed in it shows my picture if I'm not allowed in it shows a red cross It doesn't disclose any other information It has to have no special gadgets That can only mean one thing following on from Ross's statement which I agree with completely If it means no special gadgets it has to run on a mobile phone That's the only choice we have we have to make it work on mobile phones There are 6。6 billion mobile phone subscriptions My favorite statistic of all time only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world That means something I don't know what I rely on our futurologists to tell me It has to be a utility which is extensible So it has to be something that anybody could build on Anybody should be able to use this infrastructure you don't need permissions licenses whatever anyone should be able to write some code to do this You know what symmetry is This is how we're going to do it We're going to do it using phones and we're going to do it using mobile proximity I'm going to suggest to you Doctor Who's psychic paper is already here and if any of you have got one of the new Barclay's debit cards with the contactless interface on it you've already got that technology If you've ever been up to the big city and used an Oyster card at all does that ring any bells to anybody The technology already exists The first phones that have the technology built in the Google Nexus the S2 the technology built into them are already in the shops So the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom's door and he can show my mom his phone and she can tap it with her phone and it will come up with green if he really is from British Gas and allowed in and it'll come up with red if he isn't end of story We have the technology to do that And what's more although some of those things sounded a bit counter-intuitive like proving I'm over 18 without proving who I am the cryptography to do that not only exists it's extremely well-known and well-understood Digital signatures the blinding of public key certificates these technologies have been around for a while we've just had no way of packaging them up So the technology already exists We know it works There are a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places That's London Fashion Week where we built a system with O2 that's for the Wireless Festival in Hyde Park you can see the persons walking in with their VIP band it's just being checked by the Nokia phone that's reading the band I'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic this stuff works in these environments They don't need to be special So finally I know that you can do this because if you saw the episode of Doctor Who the Easter special of Doctor Who where he went to Mars in a bus I should say again for our foreign students that doesn't happen every episode This was a very special case So in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus I can't show you the clip due to the outrageous restrictions of Queen Anne-style copyright by the BBC but in the episode where he goes to Mars in a London bus Doctor Who is clearly shown getting on to the bus with the Oyster card reader using his psychic paper Which proves that psychic paper Thank you very much I want to talk to you about or share with you a breakthrough new approach for managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse We're talking about a pick pack and ship setting here So as a hint this solution involves hundreds of mobile robots sometimes thousands of mobile robots moving around a warehouse And I'll get to the solution But for a moment just think about the last time that you ordered something online You were sitting on your couch and you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt So click you put it into your shopping cart And then you decided that green pair of pants looks pretty good too click And maybe a blue pair of shoes click So at this point you've assembled your order You didn't stop to think for a moment that that might not be a great outfit But you hit submit order And two days later this package shows up on your doorstep And you open the box and you're like wow there's my goo Did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the warehouse So I'm here to tell you it's that guy right there So deep in the middle of that picture you see a classic pick-pack worker in a distribution or order fulfillments setting Classically these pick workers will spend 60 or 70 percent of their day wandering around the warehouse They'll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles in pursuit of those items of inventory Not only is this an unproductive way to fill orders it also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders So let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem I was out in the Bay area in '99 2000 the dot com boom I worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called Webvan This company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that we will deliver grocery orders online And it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively Turns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly In this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory into a few totes onto a van to deliver to the home And when you think about it it was costing us 30 dollars Imagine we had an 89¢ can of soup And that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home So long story short during my one year at Webvan what I realized by talking to all the material-handling providers was that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking Red item green blue getting those three things in a box So we said there's just got to be a better way to do this Existing material handling was set up to pump pallets and cases of goo to retail stores Of course Webvan went out of business and about a year and a half later I was still noodling on this problem It was still nagging at me And I started thinking about it again And I said let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker or my vision for how it should work I said let's focus on the problem I have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put red green and blue in this box right here What I need is a system where I put out my hand and poof the product shows up and I pack it into the order and now we're thinking this would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem This is what I need What technology is available to solve this problem But as you can see orders can come and go products can come and go It allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem and providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible So how did I arrive at this notion Well actually it came from a brainstorming exercise probably a technique that many of you use It's this notion of testing your ideas Take a blank sheet of course but then test your ideas at the limits infinity zero In this particular case we challenged ourselves with the idea: What if we had to build a distribution center in China where it's a very very low-cost market And say labor is cheap land is cheap And we said specifically What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor and we could build a million- square-foot distribution center So naturally that led to ideas that said Let's put lots of people in the warehouse And I said Hold on zero dollars per hour what I would do is 'hire' 10，000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a。m。 walk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory and then just stand there So you hold Captain Crunch you hold the Mountain Dew you hold the Diet Coke If I need it I'll call you otherwise just stand there But when I need Diet Coke and I call it you guys talk amongst yourselves Diet Coke walks up to the front pick it put it in the tote away it goes Wow what if the products could walk and talk on their own That's a very interesting very powerful way that we could potentially organize this warehouse So of course labor isn't free on that practical versus awesome spectrum So we said mobile shelving We'll put them on mobile shelving We'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around And so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008 Did any of you see the Beijing Olympics the opening ceremonies I about fell out of my couch when I saw this I'm like that was the idea We'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor the stadium floor But interestingly enough this actually relates to the idea in that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful impressive digital art all without computers I'm told it was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication You stand up I'll squat down And they made some fabulous art It speaks to the power of emergence in systems when you let things start to talk with each other So that was a little bit of the journey So of course now what became the practical reality of this idea Here is a warehouse It's a pick pack and ship center that has about 10，000 different SKUs We'll call them red pens green pens yellow Post-It Notes We send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods And we deliver them to the side of the building So all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter And the game here is to pick up the shelves take them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker This pick worker's life is completely different Rather than wandering around the warehouse she gets to stay still in a pick station like this and every product in the building can now come to her So the process is very productive Reach in pick an item scan the bar code pack it out By the time you turn around there's another product there ready to be picked and packed So what we've done is take out all of the non-value added walking searching wasting waited time and we've developed a very high-fidelity way to pick these orders where you point at it with a laser scan the UPC barcode and then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into So more productive more accurate and it turns out it's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers They actually complete the whole order So they do red green and blue not just a part of the order And they feel a little bit more in control of their environment So the side effects of this approach are what really surprised us We knew it was going to be more productive But we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking extended to other functions in the warehouse But what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC is turning it into a massively parallel processing engine So this is again a cross-fertilization of ideas Here's a warehouse and we're thinking about parallel processing supercomputer architectures The notion here is that you have 10 workers on the right side of the screen that are now all independent autonomous pick workers If the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom it has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers Contrast that for a moment with the traditional method of using a conveyor When one person passes the order to you you put something in and pass it downstream Everyone has to be in place for that serial process to work This becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse And then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking the popularity of the products And we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms to tune the floor of the warehouse So what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day All that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building and is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations Come in two days after Valentine's Day and that candy the leftover candy has all drifted to the back of the warehouse and is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there One other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing is these things can scale to ginormous So whether you're doing two pick stations 20 pick stations or 200 pick stations the path planning algorithms and all of the inventory algorithms just work In this example you see that the inventory has now occupied all the perimeter of the building because that's where the pick stations were They sorted it out for themselves So I'll conclude with just one final video that shows how this comes to bear on the pick worker's actual day in the life of So as we mentioned the process is to move inventory along the highway and then find your way into these pick stations And our software in the background understands what's going on in each station we direct the pods across the highway and we're attempting to get into a queuing system to present the work to the pick worker What's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers The faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few But this pick worker now is literally having that experience that we described before She puts out her hand The product jumps into it Or she has to reach in and get it She scans it and she puts it in the bucket And all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes So she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job Never has any idle time never has to leave her mat And actually we think not only a more productive and more accurate way to fill orders We think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders The reason we can say that though is that workers in a lot of these buildings now compete for the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day And sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren or in one case a guy said the Kiva zone is so stress-free that I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication That was at a pharmaceutical distributor so they told us not to use that video So what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that when you let things start to think and walk and talk on their own interesting processes and productivities can emerge And now I think next time you go to your front step and pick up that box that you just ordered online you break it open and the goo is in there you'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot assisted in the picking and packing of that order Thank you Is there a real you This might seem to you like a very odd question Because you might ask how do we find the real you how do you know what the real you is And so forth But the idea that there must be a real you surely that's obvious If there's anything real in the world it's you Well I'm not quite sure At least we have to understand a bit better what that means Now certainly I think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us we have a kind of a core an essence There is something about what it means to be you which defines you and it's kind of permanent and unchanging The most kind of crude way in which we have it are things like horoscopes You know people are very wedded to these actually People put them on their Facebook profile as though they are meaningul you even know your Chinese horoscope as well There are also more scientific versions of this all sorts of ways of profiling personality type such as the Myers-Briggs tests for example I don't know if you've done those A lot of companies use these for recruitment You answer a lot of questions and this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality And of course the popular fascination with this is enormous In magazines like this you'll see in the bottom left corner they'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing And if you pick up one of those magazines it's hard to resist isn't it Doing the test to find what is your learning style what is your loving style or what is your working style Are you this kind of person or that So I think that we have a common-sense idea that there is a kind of core or essence of ourselves to be discovered And that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves something that's the same throughout life Well that's the idea I want to challenge And I have to say now I'll say it a bit later but I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird the challenge actually has a very very long and distinguished history Here's the common-sense idea There is you You are the individuals you are and you have this kind of core Now in your life what happens is that you of course accumulate different experiences and so forth So you have memories and these memories help to create what you are You have desires maybe for a cookie maybe for something that we don't want to talk about at 11 o'clock in the morning in a school You will have beliefs This is a number plate from someone in America I don't know whether this number plate which says messiah 1 indicates that the driver believes in the messiah or that they are the messiah Either way they have beliefs about messiahs We have knowledge We have sensations and experiences as well It's not just intellectual things So this is kind of the common-sense model I think of what a person is There is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences But the suggestion I want to put to you today is that there's something fundamentally wrong with this model And I can show you what's wrong with one click Which is there isn't actually a you at the heart of all these experiences Strange thought Well maybe not What is there then Well clearly there are memories desires intentions sensations and so forth But what happens is these things exist and they're kind of all integrated they're overlapped they're connected in various different ways They're connecting partly and perhaps even mainly because they all belong to one body and one brain But there's also a narrative a story we tell about ourselves the experiences we have when we remember past things We do things because of other things So what we desire is partly a result of what we believe and what we remember is also informing us what we know And so really there are all these things like beliefs desires sensations experiences they're all related to each other and that just is you In some ways it's a small difference from the common-sense understanding In some ways it's a massive one It's the shift between thinking of yourself as a thing which has all the experiences of life and thinking of yourself as simply that collection of all experiences in life You are the sum of your parts Now those parts are also physical parts of course brains bodies and legs and things but they aren't so important actually If you have a heart transplant you're still the same person If you have a memory transplant are you the same person If you have a belief transplant would you be the same person Now this idea that what we are the way to understand ourselves is as not of some permanent being which has experiences but is kind of a collection of experiences might strike you as kind of weird But actually I don't think it should be weird In a way it's common sense Because I just invite you to think about by comparison think about pretty much anything else in the universe maybe apart from the very most fundamental forces or powers Let's take something like water Now my science isn't very good We might say something like water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen right We all know that I hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms and that's what water is Of course we don't We understand very easily very straightforwardly that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged Everything else in the universe is the same There's no mystery about my watch for example We say the watch has a face and hands and a mechanism and a battery But what we really mean is we don't think there is a thing called the watch to which we then attach all these bits We understand very clearly that you get the parts of the watch you put them together and you create a watch Now if everything else in the universe is like this why are we different Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts but somehow being a separate permanent entity which has those parts Now this view is not particularly new actually It has quite a long lineage You find it in Buddhism you find it in 17th 18th-century philosophy going through to the current day people like Locke and Hume But interestingly it's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience This is Paul Broks he's a clinical neuropsychologist and he says this: We have a deep intuition that there is a core an essence there and it's hard to shake off probably impossible to shake off I suspect But it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together So when you look at the brain and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self you find that there isn't a central control spot in the brain There is no kind of center where everything happens There are lots of different processes in the brain all of which operate in a way quite independently But it's because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self The term I use in the book I call it the ego trick It's like a mechanical trick It's not that we don't exist it's just that the trick is to make us feel that inside of us is something more unified than is really there Now you might think this is a worrying idea You might think that if it's true no permanent essence does that mean that really the self is an illusion Does it mean that we really don't exist There is no real you Well a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth These are three psychologists Thomas Metzinger Bruce Hood Susan Blackmore a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion the self is an illusion it's a fiction But I don't think this is a very helpful way of looking at it Go back to the watch The watch isn't an illusion because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts In the same way we're not illusions either The fact that we are in some ways just this very very complex collection ordered collection of things does not mean we're not real I can give you a very sort of rough metaphor for this Let's take something like a waterfall These are the Iguazu Falls in Argentina Now if you take something like this you can appreciate the fact that in lots of ways there's nothing permanent about this For one thing it's always changing The waters are always carving new channels with changes and tides and the weather some things dry up new things are created Of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance But it doesn't mean that the Iguazu Falls are an illusion It doesn't mean it's not real What it means is we have to understand what it is as something which has a history has certain things that keep it together but it's a process it's fluid it's forever changing Now that I think is a model for understanding ourselves and I think it's a liberating model Because if you think that you have this fixed permanent essence which is always the same throughout your life no matter what in a sense you're kind of trapped You're born with an essence that's what you are until you die if you believe in an afterlife maybe you continue But if you think of yourself as being in a way not a thing as such but a kind of a process something that is changing then I think that's quite liberating Because unlike the the waterfalls we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree Now we've got to be careful here right If you watch the X-Factor too much you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be That's not true I've heard some fantastic musicians this morning and I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them I could practice hard and maybe be good but I don't have that really natural ability There are limits to what we can achieve There are limits to what we can make of ourselves But nevertheless we do have this capacity to in a sense shape ourselves The true self as it were then is not something that is just there for you to discover you don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self What you are partly doing at least is actually creating your true self And this I think is very very significant particularly at this stage of life you're at You'll be aware of the fact how much of you changed over recent years If you have any videos of yourself three or four years ago you probably feel embarrassed because you don't recognize yourself So I want to get that message over that what we need to do is think about ourselves as things that we can shape and channel and change This is the Buddha again: Well-makers lead the water fletchers bend the arrow carpenters bend a log of wood wise people fashion themselves And that's the idea I want to leave you with that your true self is not something that you will have to go searching for as a mystery and maybe never ever find To the extent you have a true self it's something that you in part discover but in part create and that I think is a liberating and exciting prospect Thank you very much What I'm going to do is I'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland Ohio But before I do that we have to go over the definition of what green is 'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it Green The product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means There's plenty of things that are being called green now What does it actually mean We use three metrics to determine green The first metric is: Is it sustainable Which means are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations or does it have a lower carbon footprint than what's used conventionally And three: Is it renewable Does it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources such as sun wind and water Now my task at NASA is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels Extreme green Why aviation The field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined We need to find an alternative Also it's a national aeronautics directive One of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels biofuels using domestic and safe friendly resources Now combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric Actually extreme green for us is all three together; that's why you see the plus there I was told to say that So it has to be the big three at GRC That's another metric Ninety-seven percent of the world's water is saltwater How about we use that Combine that with number three Do not use arable land Because crops are already growing on that land that's very scarce around the world Number two: Don't compete with food crops That's already a well established entity they don't need another entry And lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth is fresh water Don't use fresh water If 97。5 percent of the world's water is saltwater 2。5 percent is fresh water Less than a half percent But 60 percent of the population lives within that one percent So combating my problem was now I have to be extreme green and meet the big three Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility This is a facility dedicated to the next generation of aviation fuels using halophytes A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant Most plants don't like salt but halophytes tolerate salt We also are using weeds and we are also using algae The good thing about our lab is we've had 3，600 visitors in the last two years Why do you think that's so Because we are on to something special So in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously and on the right hand side you'll see algae If you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels algae is a viable option there's a lot of funding right now and we have an algae to fuels program There's two types of algae growing One is a closed photobioreactor that you see here and what you see on the other side is our species we are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus Our job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors Now the problems with closed photobioreactors are: They are quite expensive they are automated and it's very difficult to get them in large scale So on large scale what do they use We use open pond systems Now around the world they are growing algae with this racetrack design that you see here Looks like an oval with a paddle wheel and mixes really well but when it gets around the last turn which I call turn four it's stagnant We actually have a solution for that In the GreenLab in our open pond system we use something that happens in nature: waves We actually use wave technology on our open pond systems We have 95 percent mixing and our lipid content is higher than a closed photobioreactor system which we think is significant There is a drawback to algae however: It's very expensive Is there a way to produce algae inexpensively And the answer is: yes We do the same thing we do with halophytes and that is: climatic adaptation In our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater What we do: We take a potential species we start at freshwater we add a little bit more salt when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as Brazil right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants the next tank represents Africa the next tank represents Arizona the next tank represents Florida and the next tank represents California or the open ocean What we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive anywhere in the world where there's barren desert We are being very successful so far Now here's one of the problems If you are a farmer you need five things to be successful: You need seeds you need soil you need water and you need sun and the last thing that you need is fertilizer Most people use chemical fertilizers But guess what We do not use chemical fertilizer Wait a second I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab You have to use fertilizer Believe it or not in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems 80 percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves The 20 percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous We have a natural solution: fish No we don't cut up the fish and put them in there Fish waste is what we use As a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies that we've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way to seawater Freshwater mollies: cheap they love to make babies and they love to go to the bathroom And the more they go to the bathroom the more fertilizer we get the better off we are believe it or not It should be noted that we use sand as our soil regular beach sand Fossilized coral So a lot of people ask me How did you get started Well we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab It's a seedling lab We have 26 different species of halophytes and five are winners What we do here is actually it should be called a death lab 'cause we try to kill the seedlings make them rough and then we come to the GreenLab What you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing a macro-algae that I'll talk about in a minute And lastly it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work I don't just talk about what I do Here's the plant species Salicornia virginica It's a wonderful plant I love that plant Everywhere we go we see it It's all over the place from Maine all the way to California We love that plant Second is Salicornia bigelovii Very difficult to get around the world It is the highest lipid content that we have but it has a shortcoming: It's short Now you take europaea which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have And what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology combine all three to make a high-growth high-lipid plant Next when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay soybean fields gone we came up with an idea: Can you have a plant that has a land reclamation positive in Delaware And the answer is yes It's called seashore mallow Kosteletzkya virginica say that five times fast if you can This is a 100 percent usable plant The seeds: biofuels The rest: cattle feed It's there for 10 years; it's working very well Now we get to Chaetomorpha This is a macro-algae that loves excess nutrients If you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks This species is so significant to us The properties are very close to plastic We are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic If we are successful we will revolutionize the plastics industry So we have a seed to fuel program And so we do G。C extraction lipid optimization so on and so forth because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels aviation specifics so on and so forth So far we talked about water and fuel but along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia: It's a food product So we talk about ideas worth spreading right How about this: In sub-Saharan Africa next to the sea saltwater barren desert how about we take that plant plant it half use for food half use for fuel We can make that happen inexpensively You can see there's a greenhouse in Germany that sells it as a health food product This is harvested and in the middle here is a shrimp dish and it's being pickled So I have to tell you a joke Salicornia is known as sea beans saltwater asparagus and pickle weed So we are pickling pickle weed in the middle Oh I thought it was funny And at the bottom is seaman's mustard It does make sense this is a logical snack You have mustard you are a seaman you see the halophyte you mix it together it's a great snack with some crackers And last garlic with Salicornia which is what I like So water fuel and food None of this is possible without the GreenLab team Just like the Miami Heat has the big three we have the big three at NASA GRC That's myself professor Bob Hendricks who's our fearless leader and Dr Arnon Chait The backbone of the GreenLab is students Over the last two years we've had 35 different students from around the world working at GreenLab As a matter fact my division chief says a lot You have a green university I say I'm okay with that 'cause we are nurturing the next generation of extreme green thinkers which is significant So in first summary I presented to you what we think is a global solution for food fuel and water There's something missing to be complete Clearly we use electricity We have a solution for you We're using clean energy sources here So we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab we have four or five more hopefully coming soon We are also using something that is quite interesting there is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center hasn't been used for 15 years Along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues we realized that they are still viable so we are refurbishing them right now In about 30 days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab And the reason why you see red red and yellow is a lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday This is a picture taken on Saturday There are no cars around but you see my truck in yellow I work on Saturday This is a proof to you that I'm working 'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done most people know that Here's a concept with this: We are using the GreenLab for a micro-grid test bed for the smart grid concept in Ohio We have the ability to do that and I think it's going to work So GreenLab Research Facility A self-sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today We really really hope this concept catches on worldwide We think we have a solution for food water fuel and now energy Complete and it meets the big three at GRC: Don't use arable land don't compete with food crops and most of all don't use fresh water So I get a lot of questions about What are you doing in that lab And I usually say None of your business that's what I'm doing in the lab And believe it or not my number one goal for working on this project is I want to help save the world Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option which would you choose grilled or fried chicken Now most people would answer grilled and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories However grilled chicken poses a hidden danger The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines -- specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine or PhIP -- which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound A carcinogen is any substance or agent that causes abnormal growth of cells which can also cause them to metastasize or spread They are also organic compounds in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia is replaced with a more complex group Studies show that antioxidants are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines However no studies exist yet that show how or why These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens And as you can see none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea And I was led to it through a series of events I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office -- which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine and seven different fast food restaurants They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65 which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning So I was very surprised about this And I was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken which doesn't seem very harmful But then one night my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner and I noticed that the edges of the chicken which had been marinated in lemon juice turned white And later in biology class I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis saying that could possibly the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade and could it be due to the differences in PH So my idea was born and I had the project set up and a hypothesis so what was my next step Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at because I didn't have the equipment in my school I thought this would be easy but I emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where I lived and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me Most of the others either never responded back said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times However it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project The first stage was completed at home which consisted of marinating the chicken grilling the chicken amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab which is where I extracted the chemicals changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken The final stages when I ran the samples through a high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometer which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had in my chicken So when I went through the data I had very surprising results because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients actually inhibited the carcinogen formation When compared with the unmarinated chicken which is what I used as my control I found that lemon juice worked by far the best which decreased the carcinogens by about 98 percent The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade also worked very well decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation but it was nearly negligible And the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially was the time cooked And I found that if you increase the time cooked the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases So the best way to marinate chicken based on this is to not under-cook but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken and marinate in either lemon juice brown sugar or saltwater Based on these findings I have a question for you Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet that could potentially save your life Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated you're definitely going to catch cancer and die However anything you can do to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle Is it worth it to you How will you cook your chicken now Shree Bose: Hi everyone I'm Shree Bose I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner And I want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they're different colors Sounds ridiculous right But that was me years ago And that was my first science fair project It got a bit more complicated from there My older brother Panaki Bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when I barely understood basic algebra My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can And then came the summer after my freshman year when my grandfather passed away due to cancer And I remember watching my family go through that and thinking that I never wanted another family to feel that kind of loss So armed with all the wisdom of freshman year biology I decided I wanted to do cancer research at 15 Good plan So I started emailing all of these professors in my area asking to work under their supervision in a lab Got rejected by all except one And then went on my next summer to work under Dr Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth Texas And that is where the research began So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about or at least don't pay that much attention to But yet it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States In fact one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer One in 100 will die from it Chemotherapy one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells Cisplatin is a relatively common ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug -- a relatively simple molecule made in the lab that messes with the DNA of cancer cells and causes them to kill themselves Sounds great right But here's the problem: sometimes patients become resistant to the drug and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free they come back And this time they no longer respond to the drug It's a huge problem In fact it's one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today So we wanted to figure out how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant to this drug called Cisplatin And we wanted to figure this out because if we could figure that out then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening So that's what we set out to do And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase an energy protein So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein and we saw this huge shift I mean on the slide you can see that on our sensitive side these cells that are responding to the drug when we start blocking the protein the number of dying cells -- those colored dots -- they're going down But then on this side with the same treatment they're going up -- interesting But those are dots on a screen for you; what exactly does that mean Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell And in fact it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant And that's huge In fact it means that if a patient comes in and they're resistant to this drug then if we give them a chemical to block this protein then we can treat them again with the same drug And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness -- possibly for many different types of cancer So that was my work and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren But my work wasn't just about the research It was about finding my passion That's why being the grand prize winner of the Google Global Science Fair -- cute picture right -- it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor And ever since then I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys But like I said my journey wasn't just about the research it was about finding my passion and it was about making my own opportunities It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing After all my story begins with a dried withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there Thank you Naomi Shah: Hi everyone I'm Naomi Shah and today I'll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients 1。6 million deaths worldwide One death every 20 seconds People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors And the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined Now these statistics had a huge impact on me but what really sparked my interest in my research was watching both my dad and my brother suffer from chronic allergies year-round It confused me; why did these allergy symptoms persist well past the pollen season With this question in mind I started researching and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit As soon as I realized this I investigated the underlying relationship between four prevalent air pollutants and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients At first I just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients But soon after I developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health because that relationship seems so important So with that in mind I started researching more I started investigating more and I became very passionate Because I realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more effectively For example volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools homes and workplaces They're everywhere These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant as defined by the U。S Clean Air Act Which is surprising to me because these chemical pollutants through my research I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created I'm going to show it to you on my laptop And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today Julie And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered into my interactive software model And this can be used by anyone So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes or someone who's really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder So Julie's going to her doctor's office to get treated for her asthma And the doctor has her sit down and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate -- which is essentially her exhalation rate or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath So that peak expiratory flow rate I've entered it up into the interactive software model I've also entered in her age her gender and her height I've assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels So any user can come in here and click on lung function report and it'll take them to this report that I created And this report really drives home the crux of my research So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner -- it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate in the yellow bar This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate what her exhalation rate or lung health should be based on her age gender and height So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar and he says Wow we need to give her steroids medication and inhalers But I want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids inhalers and medication the doctor turns to Julie and says Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters Clean out the air ducts in your home in your workplace in your school Stop the use of incense and candles And if you're remodeling your house take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring Because these solutions are natural these solutions are sustainable and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma more respiratory disorders as well as more pollutants But before I end my talk today I want to leave you with one saying And that saying is that genetics loads the gun but the environment pulls the trigger And that made a huge impact on me when I was doing this research Because what I feel is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level that we can't do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home in our own school and in our own workplace we can make a huge difference in air quality Because remember we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors And air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general So I want you to reimagine a world with better air quality better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations Thank you Lisa Ling: Right Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly Your Google Science Fair champions Your winners If your life were a book and you were the author how would you want your story to go That's the question that changed my life forever Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert all I wanted was to be free I would daydream about traveling the world living in a place where it snowed and I would picture all of the stories that I would go on to tell At the age of 19 the day after I graduated high school I moved to a place where it snowed and I became a massage therapist With this job all I needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and I could go anywhere For the first time in my life I felt free independent and completely in control of my life That is until my life took a detour I went home from work early one day with what I thought was the flu and less than 24 hours later I was in the hospital on life support with less than a two percent chance of living It wasn't until days later as I lay in a coma that the doctors diagnosed me with bacterial meningitis a vaccine-preventable blood infection Over the course of two and a half months I lost my spleen my kidneys the hearing in my left ear and both of my legs below the knee When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital I felt like I had been pieced back together like a patchwork doll I thought the worst was over until weeks later when I saw my new legs for the first time The calves were bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot with a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle to look like a vein I didn't know what to expect but I wasn't expecting that With my mom by my side and tears streaming down our faces I strapped on these chunky legs and I stood up They were so painful and so confining that all I could think was how am I ever going to travel the world in these things How was I ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories as I always wanted And how was I going to snowboard again That day I went home I crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months: me passed out escaping from reality with my legs resting by my side I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken But I knew that in order to move forward I had to let go of the old Amy and learn to embrace the new Amy And that is when it dawned on me that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore I could be as tall as I wanted Or as short as I wanted depending on who I was dating And if I snowboarded again my feet aren't going to get cold And best of all I thought I can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales rack And I did So there were benefits here It was this moment that I asked myself that life-defining question: If my life were a book and I were the author how would I want the story to go And I began to daydream I daydreamed like I did as a little girl and I imagined myself walking gracefully helping other people through my journey and snowboarding again And I didn't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder I could actually feel it I could feel the wind against my face and the beat of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment And that is when a new chapter in my life began Four months later I was back up on a snowboard although things didn't go quite as expected: My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when I fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard went flying down the mountain I was so shocked I was just as shocked as everybody else and I was so discouraged but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet that I would be able to do this again And this is when I learned that our borders and our obstacles can only do two things: one stop us in our tracks or two force us to get creative I did a year of research still couldn't figure out what kind of legs to use couldn't find any resources that could help me So I decided to make a pair myself My leg maker and I put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in As you can see rusted bolts rubber wood and neon pink duct tape And yes I can change my toenail polish It was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive a new kidney from my dad that allowed me to follow my dreams again I started snowboarding then I went back to work then I went back to school Then in 2005 I cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports From there I had the opportunity to go to South Africa where I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet so they could attend school And just this past February I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world I had no idea what to expect But if you ask me today if I would ever want to change my situation I would have to say no Because my legs haven't disabled me if anything they've enabled me They've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities and that's why I believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything and we can be anything It's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head-on that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits And although today is about innovation without borders I have to say that in my life innovation has only been possible because of my borders I've learned that borders are where the actual ends but also where the imagination and the story begins So the thought that I would like to challenge you with today is that maybe instead of looking at our challenges and our limitations as something negative or bad we can begin to look at them as blessings magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations and help us go further than we ever knew we could go It's not about breaking down borders It's about pushing off of them and seeing what amazing places they might bring us Thank you My story is a little bit about war It's about disillusionment It's about death And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage And perhaps also there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century I don't believe in straightforward narratives I don't believe in a life or history written as decision A led to consequence B led to consequence C -- these neat narratives that we're presented with and that perhaps we encourage in each other I believe in randomness and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random I'm colorblind I was born unable to see most colors This is why I wear gray and black most of the time and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot and sure enough I failed I couldn't see all the blinking different lights and I can't distinguish color So I had to choose another career and this was in fact relatively easy for me because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood which was international relations As a child I read the newspaper thoroughly I was fascinated by the Cold War over intermediate-range nuclear missiles the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U。S in Angola or Afghanistan These things really interested me And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat And I one day I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said Daddy I want to be a diplomat And he turned to me and he said Carne you have to be very clever to be a diplomat And my ambition was sealed In 1989 I entered the British Foreign Service That year 5，000 people applied to become a diplomat and 20 of us succeeded And as those numbers suggest I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world Being a diplomat then and now is an incredible job and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events I traveled to the Gaza Strip I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary I met Yasser Arafat I negotiated with Saddam's diplomats at the U。N Later I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan surrounded by my Special Forces escort who themselves had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines because it was so dangerous And that was exciting -- that was fun It was really interesting And it's a great cadre of people incredibly close-knit community of people And the pinnacle of my career as it turned out was when I was posted to New York I'd already served in Germany Norway various other places but I was posted to New York to serve on the U。N Security Council for the British delegation And my responsibility was the Middle East which was my specialty And there I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process we can talk about that later if you wish -- but above all my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons I was the chief British negotiator on the subject and I was steeped in the issue And anyway my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy We went through several wars during my time in New York I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before which were of course deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time So it was kind of the best of time worst of times kind of experience I lived the high-life Although I worked very long hours I lived in a penthouse in Union Square I was a single British diplomat in New York City; you can imagine what that might have meant I had a good time But in 2002 when my tour came to an end I decided I wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London I decided to take a sabbatical in fact at the New School Bruce In some inchoate inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work with me I was exhausted and I was also disillusioned in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on And I decided to take some time out from work The Foreign Office was very generous You could take these special unpaid leave as they called them and yet remain part of the diplomatic service but not actually do any work It was nice And eventually I decided to take a secondment to join the U。N in Kosovo which was then under U。N administration And two things happened in Kosovo which kind of again shows the randomness of life because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage But they were random things One was that in the summer of 2004 the British government somewhat reluctantly decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War a very limited subject And I testified to that inquiry in secret I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD and my testimony to the inquiry said three things: that the government exaggerated the intelligence which was very clear in all the years I'd read it And indeed our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors let alone to us Secondly the government had ignored all available alternatives to war which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still The third reason I won't go into But anyway I gave that testimony and that presented me with a crisis What was I going to do This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues of my ministers who had in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood And so I was in crisis And this wasn't a pretty thing I moaned about it I hesitated I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie The Insider which you may know where he goes back to CBS and he goes You know I just can't do this anymore Something's broken And it was like that for me I love that movie I felt just something's broken I can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff And it was a very very uncomfortable unpleasant feeling And I started to fall And today that fall hasn't stopped; I'm still falling But in a way I've got used to the sensation of it And in a way I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff wondering what to do A second thing happened in Kosovo which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water forgive me A second thing happened in Kosovo which kind of delivered the answer which I couldn't really answer which is What do I do with my life I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat to be serving my country I wanted to be an ambassador and my mentors my heroes people who got to the top of my profession and here I was throwing it all away A lot of my friends were still in it My pension was in it And I gave it up And what was I going to do And that year in Kosovo this terrible terrible thing happened which I saw In March 2004 there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo 18 people were killed It was anarchy And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing And that is not a very nice feeling to see and I saw it And I went through it I went through those mobs And with my Albanian friends we tried to stop it but we failed And that riot taught me something which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots which went on for several days took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then and the Kosovo government let alone the Kosovo people were not actually participating in those talks There was this whole fancy diplomatic system this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo and the Kosovars weren't part of it And funnily enough they were frustrated about that Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration It wasn't the only reason and life is not simple one reason narratives It was a complicated thing and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was But that was one of the reasons And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise it gave my wife the inspiration She said Why don't you advise the Kosovars Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service They were not allowed diplomats They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo And so that was the idea That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U。N in Kosovo I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him Look I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy I know this stuff It's what I do Why don't I come and help you And he raised his glass of raki to me and said Yes Carne Come And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo And Kosovo became independent Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world and we're advising seven or eight different countries or political groups depending on how you wish to define them -- and I'm not big on definitions We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island We're advising the Burmese opposition the government of Southern Sudan which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen There's a bit of randomness here too because when I was beginning Independent Diplomat I went to a party in the House of Lords which is a ridiculous place but I was holding my drink like this and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me And we started talking and he said -- I told him what I was doing and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York And he said Why don't you see my colleagues in New York And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ？What If！ which some of you have probably heard of And one thing led to another and I ended up having a desk in ？What If in New York when I started Independent Diplomat And watching ？What If develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy like business is a business of solving problems and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy; it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things And Independent Diplomat today tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ？What If！ We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients It's not easy because our clients by definition are having a difficult time diplomatically There are I don't know some lessons from all of this personal and political -- and in a way they're the same thing The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing and I recommend it And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world which is that the world is fragmenting States mean less than they used to and the power of the state is declining That means the power of others things is rising Those other things are called non-state actors They may be corporations they may be mafiosi they may be nice NGOs they may anything any number of things We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world then that means who is left to deal with them who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them Us If they can't do it who's left to deal with it We have no choice but to embrace that reality What this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations or global affairs or chaos in Somalia or what's going on in Burma is none of your business and that you can leave it to governments to get on with I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia Ask me how later particularly if you eat fish interestingly enough but that connection is there We are all intimately connected And this isn't just Tom Friedman it's actually provable in case after case after case What that means is instead of asking your politicians to do things you have to look to yourself to do things And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way There aren't neat examples but one example is this: the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work -- the U。N Security Council The U。N was established in 1945 Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict Today 80 percent of the agenda of the U。N Security Council is about conflicts within states involving non-state parties -- guerillas separatists terrorists if you want to call them that people who are not normal governments who are not normal states That is the state of the world today When I realized this and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council weren't actually there weren't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council I thought this is wrong Something's got to be done about this So I started off in a traditional mode Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U。N Security Council We went around 70 U。N member states -- the Kazaks the Ethiopians the Israelis -- you name them we went to see them -- the secretary general all of them and said This is all wrong This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected You've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think It'll be great You can have an exchange You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions which means your decisions will be more effective and durable Super-logical you would think I mean incredibly logical So obvious anybody could get it And of course everybody got it Everybody went Yes of course you're absolutely right Come back to us in maybe six months And of course nothing happened -- nobody did anything The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago when I was there 10 years ago So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought what can we do about it And I thought I'm buggered if I'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done So what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves So now Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U。N Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots rebels from Aceh and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U N Security Council and for the members of the U。N Security Council to explain to them what they want So there's actually a conversation which has never before happened And of course describing all this any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult and I entirely agree with you The chances of failure are very high but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today and I think that outputs is what matters not process not technology frankly so much either Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran where Ahmadinejad remains in power Technology has not delivered political change in Iran You've got to look at the outputs and you got to say to yourself What can I do to produce that particular output That is the politics of the 21st century and in a way Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation that change that is happening to all of us That's my story Thanks We live on a human-dominated planet putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth This is bad news but perhaps surprising to you it's also part of the good news We're the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it It's also good news because the planetary risks we're facing are so large that business as usual is not an option In fact we're in a phase where transformative change is necessary which opens the window for innovation for new ideas and new paradigms This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability On this journey I'd like to bring apart from yourselves a good friend a stakeholder who's always absent when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues a stakeholder who refuses to compromise -- planet Earth So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past 10，000 years This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100，000 years It's a very important period -- it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet We've had the same roughly abilities that developed civilizations as we know it This is the environmental conditions on the planet Here used as a proxy temperature variability It was a jumpy ride 80，000 years back in a crisis we leave Africa we colonize Australia in another crisis 60，000 years back we leave Asia for Europe in another crisis 40，000 years back and then we enter the remarkably stable Holocene phase the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development A thousand years into this period we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture we domesticate animals and plants You have the Roman the Greek and the story as you know it The only phase as we know it that can support humanity The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze on this poor planet a quadruple sqeeze which as its first squeeze has population growth of course Now this is not only about numbers; this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people committed to nine billion people it's an equity issue as well The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet have been caused by the rich minority the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon in the mid-18th century The majority of the planet aspiring for development having the right for development are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle a momentous pressure The second pressure on the planet is of course the climate agenda -- the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science is that it would be enough to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm to avoid average temperatures exceeding two degrees to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet holding six meters -- level rising the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet holding another seven meters -- sea level rising Now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet a resilient planet but unfortunately the third pressure is the ecosystem decline Never have we seen in the past 50 years such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term in our forests land and biodiversity The forth pressure is surprise the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm that ecosystems behave linearly predictably and that in fact surprise is universal as systems tip over very rapidly abruptly and often irreversibly This dear friends poses a human pressure on the planet of momentous scale We may in fact have entered a new geological era -- the Anthropocene where humans are the predominant driver of change at a planetary level Now as a scientist what's the evidence for this Well the evidence is unfortunately ample It's not only carbon dioxide that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change You can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being -- nitrous oxide methane deforestation overfishing land degredation loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years Simultaneously they branch off in the mid-50s 10 years after the Second World War showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s You see for the first time an imprint on the global level And I can tell you you enter the disciplinary research in each of these you find something remarkably important the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet the decade when we have to bend the curves Now as if this was not enough -- to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet -- we also have to recognize the fact that systems do have multiple stable states separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system Now the system may gradually -- under pressure of climate change erosion biodiversity loss -- lose the depth of the cup the resilience but appear to be healthy and appear to suddenly under a threshold be tipping over Upff Sorry Changing state and literally ending up in an undesired situation where new biophysical logic takes over new species take over and the system gets locked Do we have evidence of this Yes coral reef systems Biodiverse low-nutrient hard coral systems under multiple pressures of overfishing unsustainable tourism climate change A trigger and the system tips over loses its resilience soft corals take over and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development The Arctic -- a beautiful system -- a regulating biome at the planetary level taking the knock after knock on climate change appearing to be in a good state No scientist could predict that in 2007 suddenly what could be crossing a threshold The system suddenly very surprisingly loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover And the drama is of course that when the system does this the logic may change It may get locked in an undesired state because it changes color absorbs more energy and the system may get stuck In my mind the largest red flag warning for humanity that we are in a precarious situation As a sideline you know that the only red flag that popped up here was a submarine from an unnamed country that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic to be able to control the oil resources Now if we have evidence which we now have that wetlands forests unclear monsoon system the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way 30 or so scientists around the world gathered and asked a question for the first time Do we have to put the planet into the the pot So we have to ask ourselves: are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation where we're coming too close to thresholds that could lead to deleterious and very undesired if now catastrophic change for human development You know you don't want to stand there In fact you're not even allowed to stand where this gentleman is standing at the foaming slippery waters at the threshold In fact there's a fence quite upstream of this threshold beyond which you are in a danger zone And this is the new paradigm which we gathered two three years back recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts is of the past Now we to ask ourselves: which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene And could we even thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science identify the thresholds the points where we may expect nonlinear change And could we even define a planetary boundary a fence within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity This work which was published in Nature late 2009 after a number of years of analysis led to the final proposition that we can only find nine planetary boundaries with which under active stewardship would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space These include of course climate It may surprise you that it's not only climate But it shows that we are interconnected among many systems on the planet with the three big systems climate change stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet But we also include what we call the slow variables the systems that under the hood regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet -- the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet land use change rate of biodiversity loss freshwater use functions which regulate biomass on the planet carbon sequestration diversity And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify -- air pollution including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates but also chemical pollution Together these form an integrated whole for guiding human development in the Anthropocene understanding that the planet is a complex self-regulating system In fact most evidence indicates that these nine may behave as three Musketeers One for all All for one You degrade forests you go beyond the boundary on land you undermine the ability of the climate system to stay stable The drama here is in fact that it may show that the climate challenge is the easy one if you consider the whole challenge of sustainable development Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries What you see here in black line is the safe operating space the quantified boundaries as suggested by this analysis The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point the pre-industrial point where we're very safely in the safe operating space In the '50s we start branching out In the '60s already through the green revolution and the Haber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s actually right after Rio And today we are in a situation where we estimate that we've transgressed three boundaries the rate of biodiversity loss which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity -- one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs -- nitrogen and climate change But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others but we are approaching fast on land water phosphorus and oceans But this gives a new paradigm to guide humanity to put the light on our so far overpowered industrial vehicle which operates as if we're only on a dark straight highway Now the question then is: how gloomy is this Is then sustainable development utopia Well there's no science to suggest In fact there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative a transformative gear across scales The drama is of course is that 200 countries on this planet have to simultaneously start moving in the same direction But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm from the current linear command and control thinking looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible a much more adaptive approach where we recognize that redundancy both in social and environmental systems is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change We have to invest in persistence in the ability of social systems and ecological systems to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup We have to invest in transformations capability moving from crisis into innovation and the ability to rise after a crisis and of course to adapt to unavoidable change This is a new paradigm We're not doing that at any scale on governance But is it happening anywhere Do we have any examples of success on this mind shift being applied at the local level Well yes in fact we do and the list can start becoming longer and longer There's good news here for example from Latin America where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming basically to a dead-end with lower and lower yields degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies which today for example in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch zero till farming which not only produces more food but also sequesters carbon The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story Under the realization from tourist operators fishermen the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed under the current governance regime Global change beautification rack culture overfishing and unsustainable tourism all together placing this system in the realization of crisis But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset which today has led to a completely new governance strategy to build resilience acknowledge redundancy and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole and then allow for much more redundancy in the system Sweden the country I come from has other examples where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as -- as in many countries -- as flood-prone polluted nuisance in the peri-urban regions But again a crisis new partnerships actors locally transforming these into a key component of sustainable urban planning So crisis leading into opportunities Now what about the future Well the future of course has one massive challenge which is feeding a world of nine billion people We need nothing less than a new green revolution and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink It has to basically do this on current land We cannot expand anymore because it erodes the planetary boundaries We cannot continue consuming water as we do today with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean And we need a transformation Well interestingly and based on my work and others in Africa for example we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems with innovations and supplementary irrigation to bridge dry spells and droughts sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients from toilets back to farmers' fields and innovations in tillage systems we can triple quadruple yield levels on current land Elinor Ostrom the latest Nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons if we invest in trust local action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations where local actors together can deal with the global commons at a large scale But even on the hard policy area we have innovations We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time And what shall we do Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes but for example one policy measure feed-in tariffs on the energy system which is already applied from China doing it on offshore wind systems all the way to the U。S where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy but you can subsidize electricity to poor people You get people out of poverty You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector while at the same time stimulating innovation -- examples of things that can be out scaled quickly at the planetary level So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here and we can list many many examples of transformative opportunities around the planet The key though in all of these the red thread is the shift in mindset moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future where we instead backcast our future and we say What is the playing field on the planet What are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate and then backtrack innovations within that But of course the drama is it clearly shows that incremental change is not an option So there is scientific evidence They sort of say the harsh news that we are facing the largest transformative development since the industrialization In fact what we have to do over the next 40 years is much more dramatic and more exciting than what we did when we moved into the situation we're in today Now science indicates that yes we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space if we move simultaneously collaborating on a global level from local to global scale in transformative options which build resilience on a finite planet Thank you The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 when there was a disputed presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of that election there was an outbreak of ethnic violence And there was a lawyer in Nairobi Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site Kenyan Pundit And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on The comments began pouring in and Okolloh would collate them She would post them And she quickly said It's too much I could do this all day every day and I can't keep up There is more information about what's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage If only there was a way to automate this And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said We could do that and in 72 hours they launched Ushahidi Ushahidi -- the name means witness or testimony in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field whether it's from the web or critically via mobile phones and SMS aggregating it and putting it on a map That's all it is but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it and it maps it and it makes it public And that that maneuver called crisis mapping was kicked off in Kenya in January of 2008 And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform It's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud It's been deployed in Washington D。C to track snow cleanup And it's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide all right This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than three years Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity And the interesting moment now the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true That is the resource that I'm talking about I call it cognitive surplus And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large sometimes global projects Cognitive surplus is made up of two things The first obviously is the world's free time and talents The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects Now that free time existed in the 20th century but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century That's the second half of cognitive surplus The media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume and we got as a result very good at consuming But now that we've been given media tools -- the Internet mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us We still like to consume of course But it turns out we also like to create and we like to share And it's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource And using cognitive surplus we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific literary artistic political efforts Designing We're also getting of course a lot of LOLcats LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now This is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that along with Ushahidi Now I want to stipulate as the lawyers say that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act There are other candidates of course but LOLcats will do as a general case But here's the thing: The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act Someone who has done something like this however mediocre and throwaway has tried something has put something forward in public And once they've done it they can do it again and they could work on getting it better There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats right to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff But media abundance never works that way Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything Even with the sacred printing press we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals So before I talk about what is I think the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi I want to talk about their shared source And that source is design for generosity It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them or because we're being paid to do them This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini who set out to test at the beginning of this decade what they called deterrence theory And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior: If you want somebody to do less of something add a punishment and they'll do less of it Simple straightforward commonsensical -- also largely untested And so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in Haifa Israel They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension which is pick-up time At pick-up time the teachers who have been with your children all day would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back Meanwhile the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work running late running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late So Gneezy and Rustichini said How many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals -- that there were between six and 10 instances of late pick-ups on average in these 10 daycare centers So they divided the daycare centers into two groups The white group there is the control group; they change nothing But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line they said We are changing this bargain as of right now If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill Boom No ifs ands or buts And the minute they did that the behavior in those daycare centers changed Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine And you can see immediately what happened right The fine broke the culture of the daycare center By adding a fine what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers And so the parents quite sensibly said 10 shekels to pick my kid up late What could be bad The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational self-maximizing actors and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints But that's not right They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones And critically the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say Okay that's it All done; fine And then a really interesting thing happens: Nothing changes The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible that incompatibility can persist over long periods So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain when you're really designing for generosity This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi This is I think the range that matters Both of these rely on cognitive surplus Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share Here is the critical difference between these: LOLcats is communal value for each other Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared publicly available data whether it's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever This is good I like LOLcats as much as the next guy maybe a little more even but this is also a largely solved problem I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying Where oh where can I find a picture of a cute cat Ushahidi by contrast It's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation It really is going to be a side effect of what we collectively make of these kinds of efforts There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs That will be true year-in and year-out The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century What's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said the inventor and entrepreneur Kamen said Free cultures get what they celebrate We've got a choice before us We've got this trillion hours a year We can use it to crack each other up and we're going to do that That we get for free But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value And to the degree we're going to do that to the degree we're able to do that we'll be able to change society Thank you very much So if you're in the audience today or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem Whether you're an artist a technologist a lawyer or a fan the handling of copyright directly impacts your life Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies mashups and more we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works Two years ago recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single Forever A fan saw it on TV recorded it with her camera phone and uploaded it to YouTube Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video in our Content ID system within seconds of attempting to upload the video the copy was detected giving Sony the choice of what to do next But how do we know that the user's video was a copy Well it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube And that's over 20 hours of video every minute When we find a match we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking We're not just talking about a few videos we're talking about over 100 years of video every day between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site When we compare those hundred years of video we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database It would be like 36，000 people staring at 36，000 monitors each and every day without so much as a coffee break Now what do we do when we find a match Well most rights owners instead of blocking will allow the copy to be published And then they benefit through the exposure advertising and linked sales Remember Chris Brown's video Forever Well it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts and that looked like the end of the story but sometime last year a young couple got married This is their wedding video You may have seen it What's amazing about this is if the processional of the wedding was this much fun can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been I mean who are these people I totally want to go to that wedding So their little wedding video went on to get over 40 million views And instead of Sony blocking they allowed the upload to occur And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes And the song 18 months old went back to number four on the iTunes charts So Sony is generating revenue from both of these And Jill and Kevin the happy couple they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference The video's inspired over 26，000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence The JK Wedding Entrance Dance became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of The Office which just goes to show it's truly an ecosystem of culture Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios but sometimes big studios borrowing back By empowering choice we can create a culture of opportunity And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification So why has no one ever solved this problem before It's because it's a big problem and it's complicated and messy It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners There's musical labels There's multiple music publishers And each of these can vary by country There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together So we have to manage many claims to the same video YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases But the system only works through the participation of rights owners If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube you should register in the Content ID system and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content By simply blocking all reuse you'll miss out on new art forms new audiences new distribution channels and new revenue streams But it's not just about dollars and impressions Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading Thank you I was here four years ago and I remember at the time that the talks weren't put online I think they were given to TEDsters in a box a box set of DVDs which they put on their shelves where they are now And actually Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk and he said We're going to start putting them online Can we put yours online And I said Sure And four years later as I said it's been seen by four 。。 Well it's been downloaded four million times So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it And as Chris says there is a hunger for videos of me 。。 don't you feel So this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you so here it is Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis And I referenced that at the end of my last talk So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes frankly So as I was saying。。 You see he's right I mean there is a major climate crisis obviously and I think if people don't believe it they should get out more But I believe there's a second climate crisis which is as severe which has the same origins and that we have to deal with with the same urgency And I mean by this -- and you may say by the way Look I'm good I have one climate crisis; I don't really need the second one But this is a crisis of not natural resources -- though I believe that's true -- but a crisis of human resources I believe fundamentally as many speakers have said during the past few days that we make very poor use of our talents Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be or if they have any to speak of I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything Actually I kind of divide the world into two groups now Jeremy Bentham the great utilitarian philosopher once spiked this argument He said There are two types of people in this world: those who divide the world into two types and those who do not Well I do I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do They simply go through their lives getting on with it They get no great pleasure from what they do They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else If you said to them Don't do this anymore they'd wonder what you were talking about Because it isn't what they do it's who they are They say But this is me you know It would be foolish for me to abandon this because it speaks to my most authentic self And it's not true of enough people In fact on the contrary I think it's still true of a minority of people I think there are many possible explanations for it And high among them is education because education in a way dislocates very many people from their natural talents And human resources are like natural resources; they're often buried deep You have to go looking for them they're not just lying around on the surface You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves And you might imagine education would be the way that happens but too often it's not Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough Reform is no use anymore because that's simply improving a broken model What we need -- and the word's been used many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution but a revolution in education This has to be transformed into something else One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education Innovation is hard because it means doing something that people don't find very easy for the most part It means challenging what we take for granted things that we think are obvious The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense; things that people think Well it can't be done any other way because that's the way it's done I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time We don't teach American history in Britain We suppress it You know this is our policy So no doubt something fascinating was happening in December 1862 which the Americans among us will be aware of But he said this: The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion I love that Not rise to it rise with it As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country I love that word disenthrall You know what it means That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things the way things are And many of our ideas have been formed not to meet the circumstances of this century but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries But our minds are still hypnotized by them and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them Now doing this is easier said than done It's very hard to know by the way what it is you take for granted And the reason is that you take it for granted So let me ask you something you may take for granted How many of you here are over the age of 25 That's not what I think you take for granted I'm sure you're familiar with that already Are there any people here under the age of 25 Great Now those over 25 could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch Now that's a great deal of us isn't it Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing Teenagers do not wear wristwatches I don't mean they can't or they're not allowed to they just often choose not to And the reason is you see that we were brought up in a pre-digital culture those of us over 25 And so for us if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it Kids now live in a world which is digitized and the time for them is everywhere They see no reason to do this And by the way you don't need to do it either; it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it My daughter never wears a watch my daughter Kate who's 20 She doesn't see the point As she says It's a single function device Like how lame is that And I say No no it tells the date as well It has multiple functions But you see there are things we're enthralled to in education Let me give you a couple of examples One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right you will end up set for the rest of your life Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us But you know we have become obsessed with this linear narrative And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college I think we are obsessed with getting people to college Certain sorts of college I don't mean you shouldn't go to college but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now Maybe they go later not right away And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing There was this guy buying a book he was in his 30s And I said What do you do And he said I'm a fireman And I said How long have you been a fireman He said Always I've always been a fireman And I said Well when did you decide He said As a kid He said Actually it was a problem for me at school because at school everybody wanted to be a fireman He said But I wanted to be a fireman And he said When I got to the senior year of school my teachers didn't take it seriously This one teacher didn't take it seriously He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it; that I should go to college I should become a professional person that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that And he said It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful But it's what I wanted and as soon as I left school I applied to the fire service and I was accepted And he said You know I was thinking about that guy recently just a few minutes ago when you were speaking about this teacher he said because six months ago I saved his life He said He was in a car wreck and I pulled him out gave him CPR and I saved his wife's life as well He said I think he thinks better of me now You know to me human communities depend upon a diversity of talent not a singular conception of ability And at the heart of our challenges -- At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence This linearity thing is a problem When I arrived in L。A about nine years ago I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said College begins in kindergarten No it doesn't It doesn't If we had time I could go into this but we don't Kindergarten begins in kindergarten A friend of mine once said You know a three year-old is not half a six year-old They're three But as we just heard in this last session there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels you know with their resumes flipping through and saying Well this is it You've been around for 36 months and this is it You've achieved nothing -- commit Spent the first six months breastfeeding the way I can see it See it's outrageous as a conception but it unclear The other big issue is conformity We have built our education systems on the model of fast food This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering One is fast food where everything is standardized The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants where everything is not standardized they're customized to local circumstances And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies I think we have to recognize a couple of things here One is that human talent is tremendously diverse People have very different aptitudes I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar You know it worked out for Eric that's all I'm saying In a way it did not for me I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it It just wouldn't work But it's not only about that It's about passion Often people are good at things they don't really care for It's about passion and what excites our spirit and our energy And if you're doing the thing that you love to do that you're good at time takes a different course entirely My wife's just finished writing a novel and I think it's a great book but she disappears for hours on end You know this if you're doing something you love an hour feels like five minutes If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit five minutes feels like an hour And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit it doesn't feed their energy or their passion So I think we have to change metaphors We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education a manufacturing model which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process And you cannot predict the outcome of human development All you can do like a farmer is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish So when we look at reforming education and transforming it it isn't like cloning a system There are great ones like KIPP's; it's a great system There are many great models It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching And doing that I think is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution; it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum Now in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business in multimedia in the Internet These technologies combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers provide an opportunity to revolutionize education And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing tomorrow That's where children experience life Or at home if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days And I wanted to just very quickly 。。 I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night recovering old poems I wanted to read you a quick very short poem from W B Yeats who some of you may know He wrote this to his love Maud Gonne he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him And he says I've got something else but it may not be for you He says this: Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths Enwrought with gold and silver light The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I being poor have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams And every day everywhere our children spread their dreams beneath our feet And we should tread softly Thank you Thank you very much I want to talk about penguins today But first I want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans and for the Earth When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago there were 3，000 people that lived in the Galapagos Now there are over 30，000 There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz Now there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there So the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people It's the same problems in the Galapagos except obviously it's worse here in some ways than other places Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 6。7 billion people in the world and we all like to consume And one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback We're not paying the true environmental costs of our actions And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina let me just say that I had never camped before I had never lived alone for any period of time and I'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night But moreover I'd never lived on an uninhabited island Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there But it's alive with life; it's hardly uninhabited So a lot has happened in the last 40 years and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos is the importance of wild places wild things certainly wildlife and the amazing qualities that penguins have Penguins are real athletes: They can swim 173 kilometers in a day They can swim at the same speed day and night -- that's faster than any Olympic swimmer I mean they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it But what is really amazing because of this deepness here Emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes Magellanic penguins the ones that I work on they can dive to about 90 meters and they can stay down for about 4。6 minutes Humans without fins: 90 meters 3。5 minutes And I doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3。5 minutes You have to train to be able to do that So penguins are amazing athletes The other thing is I've never met anybody that really doesn't say that they like penguins They're comical they walk upright and of course they're diligent And more importantly they're well-dressed So they have all the criteria that people normally like But scientifically they're amazing because they're sentinels They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways and particularly the ocean This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos And that's what I came to study I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins but you already know penguins are rare These are the rarest penguins in the world Why I thought I was going to be able to do that I don't know But the population has changed dramatically since I was first here When I counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands We counted around 2，000 so I don't know how many penguins there really are but I know I can count 2，000 If you go and do it now the national parks count about 500 So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago And this is true of most of our living systems We have less than we had before and most of them are in fairly steep decline And I want to just show you a little bit about why That's a penguin braying to tell you that it's important to pay attention to penguins Most important of all I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome plaintful call I fell in love with penguins and it certainly has changed the rest of my life What I found out I was studying is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes the most extreme variation You've heard about these El Ninos but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to This is a cold-water event called La Nina Where it's blue and it's green it means the water is really cold And so you can see this current coming up -- in this case the Humboldt Current -- that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands and this deep undersea current the Cromwell Current that upwells around the Galapagos That brings all the nutrients: When this is cold in the Galapagos it's rich and there's plenty of food for everyone When we have extreme El Nino events you see all this red and you see no green out here around the Galapagos That means that there's no upwelling and there's basically no food So it's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas 。。 things die when there's no food But we didn't even know that that affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins and you're in the middle of an El Nino event and there are no penguins They're not breeding; they're not even around I studied marine iguanas at that point But this is a global phenomenon we know that And if you look along the coast of Argentina where I work now at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here Some years the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil and other years in these La Nina years it doesn't So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with and it's not easy So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins I didn't have any problems There were plenty of them This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves protein and oil Fortunately nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over 100，000 tourists a year to see them But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially about 21 percent since 1987 when I started these surveys in terms of number of active nests Here you can see where Punta Tombo is and they breed in incredibly dense colonies We know this because of long-term science because we have long-term studies there And science is important in informing decision makers and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we're going in And so we have this penguin project The Wildlife Conservation Society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps And also we know that it's not only Galapagos penguins that are in trouble but Magellanics and many other species of penguins And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution Penguins don't like oil and they don't like to swim through oil The nice thing is if you look down here in Argentina there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map But in fact when we went to Argentina penguins were often found totally covered in oil So they were just minding their own business They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it Because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point so when they're empty they have the ballast water in there When they come back they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean Why do they do that Because it's cheaper because they don't pay the real environmental costs We usually don't and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost At first the Argentine government said No there's no way You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina We have laws and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins In some years like this year we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil These little blue dots are the fledglings -- we do this survey every March -- which means that they're only in the environment from January until March so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil And you can see in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled Eventually the government listened and amazingly they changed their laws They moved the tanker lanes 40 kilometers farther off shore and people are not doing as much illegal dumping So what we're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled Why are there even these penguins oiled Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province which is like a state in Argentina where Punta Tombo is -- so that's about 1，000 kilometers of coastline -- but we haven't solved the problem in northern Argentina Uruguay and Brazil So now I want to show you that penguins are affected I'm just going to talk about two things This is climate change Now this has really been a fun study because I put satellite tags on the back of these Magellanic penguins Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go We thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin And what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins' positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests So that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs the other one is out there foraging and the longer they have to stay gone the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back And of course all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can't raise a lot of chicks Here you see in 2003 -- these are all the dots of where the penguins are -- they were raising a little over a half of a chick Here you can see in 2006 they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo; they're not going as far away This past year in 2009 you can see that they're now raising about a fourth of a chick and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago and then you get transferred to St Louis and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare because you're gone longer The same thing's true for penguins as well And they're going about on average now 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago We need to be able to get information out to the general public And so we started a publication with the Society for Conservation that we think presents cutting-edge science in a new novel way because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public So if you're interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation you should join with our 11 partners -- some of them here in this room like the Nature Conservancy -- and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public Lastly I want to say that all of you probably have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog a cat some sort of pet and you recognized that those are individuals And some of you consider them almost part of your family If you had a relationship with a penguin you'd see it in the same sort of way They're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they're not that different from us: They're trying to make a living they're trying to raise their offspring they're trying to get on and survive in the world This is Turbo the Penguin Turbo's never been fed He met us and got his name because he started standing under my diesel truck: a turbo truck so we named him Turbo Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak we let him in and he comes in here And I just wanted to show you what happened one day when Turbo brought in a friend So this is Turbo He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting which he would do to a female penguin And you can see he's not trying to bite This guy has never been in before and he's trying to figure out What is going on What is this guy doing This is really pretty weird And you'll see soon that my graduate student 。。 and you see Turbo's pretty intent on his flipper patting And now he's looking at the other guy saying You are really weird And now look at this: not friendly So penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats We're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate So we're trying to put that in computers in the field And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another This is a radio frequency ID system You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode so it tells you who it is It walks over the pad and you know who it is Okay so here are a few penguins coming in See this one's coming back to its nest They're all coming in at this time walking across there just kind of leisurely coming in Here's a female that's in a hurry She's got food She's really rushing back because it's hot to try to feed her chicks And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by Look how fat he is He's walking back to feed his chicks Then I realize that they're playing king of the box This is my box up here and this is the system that works You can see this penguin he goes over he looks at those wires does not like that wire He unplugs the wire; we have no data So they really are pretty amazing creatures OK Most important thing is: Only you can change yourself and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins So thank you very much How do you explain when things don't go as we assume Or better how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions For example: Why is Apple so innovative Year after year after year after year they're more innovative than all their competition And yet they're just a computer company They're just like everyone else They have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media Then why is it that they seem to have something different Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement He wasn't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day Why him And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified better funded 。。 and they didn't achieve powered man flight and the Wright brothers beat them to it There's something else at play here About three and a half years ago I made a discovery And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it As it turns out there's a pattern As it turns out all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers -- they all think act and communicate the exact same way And it's the complete opposite to everyone else All I did was codify it and it's probably the world's simplest idea I call it the golden circle Why How What This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't Let me define the terms really quickly Every single person every single organization on the planet knows what they do 100 percent Some know how they do it whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP But very very few people or organizations know why they do what they do And by why I don't mean to make a profit That's a result It's always a result By why I mean: What's your purpose What's your cause What's your belief Why does your organization exist Why do you get out of bed in the morning And why should anyone care Well as a result the way we think the way we act the way we communicate is from the outside in It's obvious We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size regardless of their industry -- all think act and communicate from the inside out Let me give you an example I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it If Apple were like everyone else a marketing message from them might sound like this: We make great computers They're beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly Want to buy one Meh And that's how most of us communicate That's how most marketing is done that's how most sales is done and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally We say what we do we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior a purchase a vote something like that Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients we always perform for our clients who do business with us Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage it has leather seats buy our car But it's uninspiring Here's how Apple actually communicates Everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo We believe in thinking differently The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly We just happen to make great computers Want to buy one Totally different right You're ready to buy a computer from me All I did was reverse the order of the information What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do; people buy why you do it People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple or a phone from Apple or a DVR from Apple But as I said before Apple's just a computer company There's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products In fact they tried A few years ago Gateway came out with flat screen TVs They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs They've been making flat screen monitors for years Nobody bought one Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs and they make great quality products and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one In fact talking about it now we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company But we do it every day People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe Here's the best part: None of what I'm telling you is my opinion It's all grounded in the tenets of biology Not psychology biology If you look at a cross-section of the human brain looking from the top down what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle Our newest brain our Homo sapien brain our neocortex corresponds with the what level The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language The middle two sections make up our limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings like trust and loyalty It's also responsible for all human behavior all decision-making and it has no capacity for language In other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures It just doesn't drive behavior When we can communicate from the inside out we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do This is where gut decisions come from You know sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures and they say I know what all the facts and details say but it just doesn't feel right Why would we use that verb it doesn't feel right Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language And the best we can muster up is I don't know It just doesn't feel right Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart or you're leading with your soul Well I hate to break it to you those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior It's all happening here in your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language But if you don't know why you do what you do and people respond to why you do what you do then how will you ever get people to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do Again the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe I always say that you know if you hire people just because they can do a job they'll work for your money but if you hire people who believe what you believe they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley And back in the early 20th century the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day Everybody was trying it And Samuel Pierpont Langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success I mean even now you ask people Why did your product or why did your company fail and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized the wrong people bad market conditions It's always the same three things so let's explore that Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50，000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine Money was no problem He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected; he knew all the big minds of the day He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic The New York Times followed him around everywhere and everyone was rooting for Langley Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio Orville and Wilbur Wright they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success They had no money; not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education not even Orville or Wilbur; and The New York Times followed them around nowhere The difference was Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine it'll change the course of the world Samuel Pierpont Langley was different He wanted to be rich and he wanted to be famous He was in pursuit of the result He was in pursuit of the riches And lo and behold look what happened The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears The others just worked for the paycheck And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out they would have to take five sets of parts because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper And eventually on December 17th 1903 the Wright brothers took flight and no one was there to even experience it We found out about it a few days later And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: The day the Wright brothers took flight he quit He could have said That's an amazing discovery guys and I will improve upon your technology but he didn't He wasn't first he didn't get rich he didn't get famous so he quit People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it And if you talk about what you believe you will attract those who believe what you believe But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe Something called the law of diffusion of innovation and if you don't know the law you definitely know the terminology The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters The next 34 percent are your early majority your late majority and your laggards The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore We all sit at various places at various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point and then the system tips And I love asking businesses What's your conversion on new business And they love to tell you Oh it's about 10 percent proudly Well you can trip over 10 percent of the customers We all have about 10 percent who just get it That's how we describe them right That's like that gut feeling Oh they just get it The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it So it's this here this little gap that you have to close as Jeffrey Moore calls it Crossing the Chasm -- because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first And these guys the innovators and the early adopters they're comfortable making those gut decisions They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf These are the people who spent 40，000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard And by the way they didn't do it because the technology was so great; they did it for themselves It's because they wanted to be first People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe In fact people will do the things that prove what they believe The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours stood in line for six hours was because of what they believed about the world and how they wanted everybody to see them: They were first People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it So let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation First the famous failure It's a commercial example As we said before a second ago the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions right You should have success then Look at TiVo From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day they are the single highest-quality product on the market hands down there is no dispute They were extremely well-funded Market conditions were fantastic I mean we use TiVo as verb I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time But TiVo's a commercial failure They've never made money And when they went IPO their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted and it's never traded above 10 In fact I don't think it's even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes Because you see when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had They said We have a product that pauses live TV skips commercials rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking And the cynical majority said We don't believe you We don't need it We don't like it You're scaring us What if they had said If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life boy do we have a product for you It pauses live TV skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits etc。 etc People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation In the summer of 1963 250，000 people showed up on the mall in Washington They sent out no invitations and there was no website to check the date How do you do that Well Dr King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America In fact some of his ideas were bad But he had a gift He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America He went around and told people what he believed I believe I believe I believe he told people And people who believed what he believed took his cause and they made it their own and they told people And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people And lo and behold 250，000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak How many of them showed up for him Zero They showed up for themselves It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August It's what they believed and it wasn't about black versus white: 25 percent of the audience was white Dr King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life We followed not for him but for ourselves And by the way he gave the I have a dream speech not the I have a plan speech Listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12-point plans They're not inspiring anybody Because there are leaders and there are those who lead Leaders hold a position of power or authority but those who lead inspire us Whether they're individuals or organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to We follow those who lead not for them but for ourselves And it's those who start with why that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them Thank you very much Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna especially birds and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month and transported far from their origins to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year a business worth almost two billion dollars The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals intended to supply the pet market or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses and this is how we end up every month with thousands of seized animals And for us to understand what happens with them we're going to follow Brad In the eyes of many people after the animals are seized they say Yay justice has been served The good guys arrived took the cute mistreated animals and everyone lived happily ever after But did they Actually no and this is where many of our problems begin Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals In Brazil they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities in which most of the cases the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers In 2002 these centers received 45，000 animals of which 37，000 were birds And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked Some lucky ones -- and among them Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that And in these places they are cared for They train their flying they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature and they are able to socialize with others from the same species But then what The Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we're talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature Therefore it would be too risky to release these animals both for the released and for the natural populations They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation Following this argument they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized However this would mean having killed 26，267 birds only in the state of São Paulo only in 2006 But some researchers myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative certain criteria concerning their health behavior inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations then technically responsible releases are possible both for the well-being of the individual and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers predators preys etc All of these were released by us On the top the turtles are just enjoying freedom On the middle this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release And on the bottom my personal favorite the little male over there four hours after his release he was together with a wild female So this is not new people have been doing this around the world But it's still a big issue in Brazil We believe we have performed responsible releases We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks So these genes are indeed going back to the populations However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge So I say Let's study more let's shed light on this issue let's do whatever we can I'm devoting my career to that And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach: Talk to your neighbor teach your children make sure your pet is from a legal breeder We need to act and act now before these ones are the only ones left Thank you very much If you think about the phone -- and Intel has tested over the last 10 years in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in Ireland and 300 in Portland -- trying to understand: How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way And if you think about the phone right it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly that sits on their kitchen table and says I'm old I'm frail It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time Now we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it Hello Hey All right That's the first time Hello Uh hey Hello Uh who Oh hey All right Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time down to the tenths of a microsecond that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk where they're like Wait who is this Oh Right Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today We call these behavioral markers There's lots of others Is the person going to the phone as quickly when it rings as they used to Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem Has their voice gotten more quiet We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet So sensors are looking at that kind of voice When you pick up the phone how much tremor are you having and what is that like and what is that trend like over a period of time Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to Is it a dexterity problem Is it the onset of arthritis Are you using the phone Are you socializing less than you used to And looking at that pattern And what does that decline in social health mean as a kind of a vital sign of the future And then wow what a radical idea we -- except in the United States -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line Wow what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things So these are what I would call behavioral markers And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel How do you put simple disruptive technologies and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk Behavioral markers matter How do we change behavior How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease early onset of disease and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time Now why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money over the last 10 years trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers This is some of the field work that we've done We have now lived with 1，000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years We study people in Rochester New York We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter and their access to healthcare and how much they socialize is very different than in the summer If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network we fly and study them as well So we study the holistic health experience of 1，000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries Why is Intel willing to fund that It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about Ten years ago when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living this is what I called it: Y2K 10 You know back in 2000 we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000 that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to It was right around New Years And that switchover when we had the larger number of older people on the planet for the first time than younger people For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic that's the expectation from demographers going forward And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this Right Y2K 10 was coming the baby boomers starting to retire Well folks it's like we know these demographics here This is a map of the entire world It's like the lights are on but nobody's home on this demographic Y2K 10 problem Right I mean we sort of get it here but we don't get it here and we're not doing anything about it The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care but deliver care in some radically different ways And in fact it's upon us I mean you probably saw these headlines This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security That actually occurred this year She took early retirement She was born one second after midnight in 1946 A retired school teacher there she is with a Social Security administrator The first boomer actually we didn't even wait till 2011 next year We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year All right so it's here This Y2K 10 problem is at our door This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe and react as opposed to prepare for it So one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem is I want to argue we have what I would call mainframe poisoning Andy Grove about six or seven years ago he doesn't even know or remember this in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase mainframe healthcare and I've been extending and expanding this He saw it written down somewhere He's like Eric that's a really cool concept I was like Actually it was your idea You said it in a Fortune Magazine article I just extended it You know this is the mainframe This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 This is the first general hospital in Vienna And actually the second general hospital in Vienna in about 1850 was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body and divided care into departments and compartments And it was reflected in our architecture it was reflected in the way that we taught students and this mainframe mentality persists today Now I'm not anti-hospital With my own healthcare problems I've taken drug therapies I've traveled to this hospital and others many many times But we worship the high hospital on a hill Right And this is mainframe healthcare And just as 30 years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts that we're carrying around in our cell phone today and suddenly computing that used to be an expert driven system it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare We are obsessed with this way of thinking When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say Quick response: healthcare The first word that comes up is doctor The second that comes up is hospital And the third is illness or sickness Right We are wired in our imagination to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place Our entire health reform discussion right now health I。T。 when we talk with policy makers equals How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare Right This is a very reactive crisis-driven system We're doing 15-minute exams with patients It's population-based We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting and we fix them up like Humpty-Dumpty all over again and send them home and hope -- we might hand them a brochure maybe an interactive website -- that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe And the problem is we can't afford it today folks We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured And now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different We've got to focus on the home We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home How do we be more proactive prevention-driven How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7 How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data psychological data relational data in and on and around the home And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior That's what we need to do for our personal health model I want to give you a couple of examples This is Mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household or any of your loved ones your parents or so forth Right Classic Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility She tripped over her oxygen tank Many people in this generation won't press the button even if they have an alert call system because they don't want to bother anybody even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month Boomers will press the button Trust me They're going to be pressing that button non-stop Right Mimi broke her pelvis lay all night all morning finally somebody came in and found her sent her to the hospital They fixed her back up She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living They put her into the nursing home unit First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility moved her from one bed to another kind of threw her rebroke her pelvis sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from no one read the chart put her on Tylenol which she is allergic to broke out got bedsores basically had heart problems and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there Now the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother Now I'm Eric Dishman I speak English I work for Intel I make a good salary I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries -- it's an area of research that I work on I have access to senators and CEOs I can't stop this from happening What happens if you don't have money you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer It's a research platform It has accelerometry You can plug in a three-lead ECG There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of Legos that you can do to capture in the wild in the real world things like tremor gait stride length and those kinds of things The problem is our understanding of falls today like Mimi is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell from the State saying What were you doing when you fell That's sort of the state of the art But with something like Shimmer or we have something called the Magic Carpet embedded sensors in carpet or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls And most often we can do two interventions fix the meds mix I'm a qualitative researcher but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on because we see the changes in their patterns in the household Right These discoveries of behavioral markers and behavioral changes are game changing and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of -- actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data in this picture from the Magic Carpet So we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months Here's what some of this data might look like This is actually sensor firings These are two different subjects in our study It's about a year's worth of data The color represents different rooms they are in the house This person on the left is living in their own home This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here Right Now this doesn't mean that much to you But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up about gait and stride length -- these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before You can go to ORCATech。org -- it has nothing to do with whales it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology -- to see more about that The problem is Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research I'm not bragging about how much we fund; it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging chronic disease management and independent living in the home So my mantra here my fourth slogan is: 10，000 households or bust We need to drive a national if not international Framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies where we have 10，000 elderly connected households with broadband full medical characterization and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies So 10，000 households or bust These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies My fifth and final phrase: I have tried for two years and there were moments when we were quite close to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something from a mainframe model to a personal health model or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare We're going to figure something out for the next 10 years and try it No matter who pays for it we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways The president needs to stand up and say at the end of a healthcare reform debate Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions clinics hospitals and nursing homes to the home in 10 years It's achievable We should do it economically we should do it morally and we should do it for quality of life But there is no goal within this health reform It's just a mess today So you know that's my last message to you How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all but it's going to be part of the solution And if we don't create a personal health movement something that we're all aiming towards in reform then we're going to move nowhere So I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward Thanks very much So 120 years ago Dr Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch I'm not sure It seems a bit extreme to me That image was the start of the X-ray technology And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner The first shot I ever did was of a soda can which was to promote a brand that we all know so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day And I do really like this shot because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time Moving on to something a bit larger this is an X-ray of a bus And the bus is full of people It's actually the same person It's just one skeleton And back in the '60s they used to teach student radiographers to take X-rays thankfully not on you and I but on dead people So I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda; she's falling apart I'm afraid because she's very old and fragile But everyone on that bus is Frieda And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray which is the sort of machine you have on borders which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things Fairly obvious what that is So using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often Technology is moving ahead and these large cargo scanner X-rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better Again though to make it come alive you need somehow to add the human element And I think the reason this image works again is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer Quite a difficult brief make a pair of men's pants look beautiful But I think the process in itself shows how exquisite they are Fashion -- now I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface I show what's within So the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it it looks the same We all look the same inside believe me The creases in the material and the sort of nuances And I show things for really what they are what they're made of I peel back the layers and expose it And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design The design comes from within It's not just Topshop I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store almost got escorted from the premises I live opposite a farm And this was the runt of the litter a piglet that died And what's really interesting is if you look at the legs you'll notice that the bones haven't fused And should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it with the amount of radiation I used anyway But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy So that's an empty parka jacket But I quite love the way it's posed Nature is my greatest inspiration And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture If you look at the roof of the Eden Project or the British library it's all this honeycomb structure And I'm sure those architects are inspired as I am by what surrounds us by nature This in fact is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional Seaweed ebbing in the tide Now how do I do this and where do I do this and all of that sort of thing This is my new purpose-built X-ray shed And the door to my X-ray room is made of lead and steel It weighs 1，250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete So I'm using quite a lot of radiation A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's And there I am This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine What's interesting really about X-ray really is if you think about it is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs or looking for contraband or whatever And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful So still working with film I'm afraid Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed apart from these large cargo-scanning machines hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it which is show my pictures big So I have to use a 1980s drum scanner which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film They scan each individual X-ray And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays So this is again my daughter's dress Still has the tag in it from me buying it so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it But there are four X-ray plates You can see them overlapping So when you move forward from something fairly small a dress which is this size onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process you can see that that is a lot of work In fact that is three months solid X-raying There is over 500 separate components Boeing sent me a 747 in containers And I sent them back an X-ray I kid you not Okay so Frieda is my dead skeleton This unfortunately is basically two pictures One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer The one on the left is an x-ray But this time I had to use a real body Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real to make it look like it was a real athlete So here I had to use a recently deceased body And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious But people do donate their bodies to art and science And when they do I'm in the queue So I like to use them The coloring so coloring adds another level to the X-rays It makes it more organic more natural It's whatever takes my fancy really It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life That flower doesn't come in bright orange I don't think But I just like it in bright orange And also with something technical like these are DJ decks it sort of adds another level It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional The most difficult things to X-ray the most technically challenging things to X-ray are the lightest things the most delicate things To get the detail in a feather believe me if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays that's quite a challenge I'm now going to show you a short film I'll step to the side The thing in there is very dangerous If you touch that you could possibly die through radiation poisoning In my career I've had two exposures to radiation which is two too many because it stays with you for life It's cumulative It has human connotations The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize but also it looks like it's a robot and it comes from a sci-fi genus It's a surprise that it has humanity but also man-made future alien associations And it's just a bit spooky The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants The lorry goes in front of it And it takes slices of X-rays through the lorry And that's how this was done It's actually slice slice It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital Slices And then if you look carefully there is all little things He's got headphones on reading the newspaper got a hat on glasses got a bag So these little details help to make it work make it real The problem with using living people is that to take an X-ray if I X-ray you you get exposed to radiation So to avoid that -- I have to avoid it somehow -- is I use dead people Now that's a variety of things from recently deceased bodies to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X-rays of the human body at different densities I have very high-tech equipment of gloves scissors and a bucket I will show how the capillary action works how it feeds I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves Look at this monster It's so basic It just grows wild That's what I really like about it the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it and it hasn't been genetically modified at all It's just happening And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye the way the leaves form They're curling back on each other So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners The thicker the object the more radiation it needs and the more time it needs The lighter the object the less radiation Sometimes you keep the time up because the time gives you detail The longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get If you look at this just the tube it is quite bright So these leaves at the edge would start to disappear What I like is how hard the edges are how sharp Yeah I'm quite pleased with it I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth for what it's really made of how it really works But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface which is things that people are used to seeing And that's the sort of thing I've been doing I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future This is a commercial application of my most recent work And what's good about this I think is that it's like a moment in time like you've turned around you've got X-ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision I do dream in X-ray I see my projects in my sleep And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off So what am I doing in the future Well this year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini which is one of my favorite cars So I've taken it apart component by component months and months and months of work And with this image I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box which is actually attached to the car So I've got to saw the car in half down the middle not an easy task in itself And then so you can get in the driver's side sit down and up against you is a wall And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life Like my first computer was a big movement in my life And I had a Mac Classic And it's a little box And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray I'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form And this is quite a good way of doing it I'm also working now with X-ray video So if you can imagine some of these flowers and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X-ray should be quite stunning But that's it I'm done Thank you very much Thank you so much Prime Minister that was both fascinating and quite inspiring So you're calling for a global ethic Would you describe that as global citizenship Is that an idea that you believe in and how would you define that Gordon Brown: I think it is about global citizenship It's about recognizing our responsibilities to others There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do that it is vital that we all come together But we don't necessarily have the means to do so So there are challenges to be met I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents But then of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism and how to combine these two I mean you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain How do you reconcile the two things GB: Well of course national identity remains important But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities And I think one of the problems of a recession is that people become more protectionist they look in on themselves they try to protect their own nation perhaps at the expense of other nations When you actually look at the motor of the world economy it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy So you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism; that's absolutely important But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally and the problems that we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone Well indeed But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest or the interest of Britons or citizens elsewhere in the world GB: Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests what is necessary for America's long-term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is necessary There is a great story again told about Richard Nixon 1958 Ghana becomes independent so it is just over 50 years ago Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country He doesn't quite know what to do so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people in the crowd How does it feel to be free And he's going around How does it feel to be free How does it feel to be free And then someone says How should I know I come from Alabama And that was the 1950s Now what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism And yet America and Africa have got a common interest And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa to work together for common causes then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big So I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism in relation to Africa or in relation to developing countries is more than that It is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries And I would say that national interest and if you like what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do in the long run come together And whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change or taking action on security or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries We're in Oxford which is the home of philosophical thought experiments And so here is one that kind of goes -- I still just want to draw out on this issue So you're on vacation at a nice beach and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach One end of the beach there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit You have time to -- you have time to alert one house What do you do GB: Modern communications Alert both I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way And I think look at the tsunami it's a classic example Where was the early warning systems You know Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes as well as the potential for climate change And when the world starts to work together with better early warning systems then you can deal with some of these problems in a far better way I just think we're not seeing at the moment the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot people have like people in the audience here where we love the kind of language that you're talking about It is inspiring A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future And yet when the situation changes you suddenly hear politicians talking as if you know for example the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians When the pedal hits the metal the idealism can get moved away I'm just wondering how -- whether you can see that changing over time whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about GB: I think every religion every faith and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion -- it has this global ethic at the center of its credo And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu or whether it's Sikh the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions So I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of that moral sense So you're building on something that is not pure self-interest You're building on people's ideas and values -- that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions But it is a set of values that cannot in my view be extinguished Then the question is how do you make that change happen How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong 。。 After the Second World War we built institutions the United Nations the IMF the World Bank the World Trade Organization the Marshall Plan There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation because these institutions were so new But they are now out of date They don't deal with the problems As I said you can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to You can't deal with the economic and financial problem So we have got to rebuild our global institutions build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules So I come back to my initial point Sometimes you think things are impossible Nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990 or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s or that polio could be eradicated or that perhaps 60 years ago nobody would have said that a man could have gone to the moon All these things have happened And we have had a speaker who said that very thing and swallowed a sword right after that which was quite dramatic GB: Followed my sword will swallow But surely a true global ethic is for someone to say I believe the life of every human on the planet is worth the same equal consideration regardless of nationality and religion And you have politicians who have -- you're elected In a way you can't say that Even if as a human being you believe that you can't say that You're elected for Britain's interests GB: We have a responsibility to protect I mean look 1918 the Treaty of Versailles and all the treaties before that the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else were about protecting the sovereign right of individual countries to do what they want Since then the world has moved forward partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection partly because of what we saw in Rwanda partly because of what we saw in Bosnia The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world So while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world Now in the end that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations and what it can do actually is But the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is in a sense taken over from the idea of self-determination as the principle governing the international community Can you picture in our lifetimes a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full-form global ethic global citizenship And basically saying that I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration and if in power we will act in that way And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic 。。 GB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country; you've got to involve all countries You're saying that you must and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work If you could get a deal at Copenhagen where people agreed A that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts B that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy-efficient technologies and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long-term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions then you are treating the world equally by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet Yes And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests GB: Yes but I think Europe has got a position which is 27 countries have already come together I mean the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak it takes a very very long time But we did get an agreement on climate change America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress Japan has made an announcement China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence And now we've got to move them to accept a long-term target and then short-term targets But more progress has been made I think in the last few weeks than had been made for some years And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together we can get that agreement to Copenhagen I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs And we would help them adapt And we would help them make the transition to a low carbon economy I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this When the IMF was created in the 1940s it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP The IMF now has limited resources one percent It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis So we've got to rebuild the world institutions And that's a big task: persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy And God shook his head and said Not this year not this decade perhaps not even in your lifetime And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted And then the story is that Barroso the president of the European Commission went to God and he asked he said When will we get a recovery of global growth And God said Not this year not in this decade perhaps not in your lifetime So Barroso walked away crying and in tears And then the secretary general of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said When will our international institutions work And God cried It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build Prime Minister I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic Thank you so much for coming to TED GB: Well thank you This is a sculpture I made which is a way of kind of freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom So it can balance on a point This is a bronze ball an aluminum arm here and then this wooden disk And the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to and that would glide easily through your hands The aluminum is because it's very light The bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free-swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between across it like this that counterbalance this weight So it allows it to roll And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction But if you put something on top of it it disbalances it And so it would tip over But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere it can stand up on one point And then there was a second level to this object which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other I was exploring really early on wanting to make things float in the air And I thought up a lot of ideas This is sculpture that I made that -- it's magnetically levitated The thing is is that it's slightly dangerous Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without um -- oops So this is just floating floating on a permanent magnetic field which stabilizes it in all directions Except there is a slight tether here which keeps it from going over the top of its field It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable I think we could roll the tape admin I have a sort of a collection of videos that I took of different installations which I could narrate This is a sculpture of the Sun and the Earth in proportion Representing that eight and a half minutes that it takes light and gravity to connect the two So here is the Earth It's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze And here is a similar sculpture That's the Sun at that end And then in a series of 55 balls it reduces proportionately -- each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately until they get down to this little Earth This is in a sculpture park in Taejon This one is about the Moon and then the distance to the Earth in proportion also This is a little stone ball floating As you can see the little tether that it's also magnetically levitated And then this is the first part of -- this is 109 spheres since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth And so this is the size of the Sun And then each of these little spheres is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun It's made up of 16 concentric shells Each one has 92 spheres This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist So this again is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the Earth And then the Moon in the center and it's floating And this is in France This is in Sapporo It's balancing on a shaft and a ball right at the center of gravity or just slightly above the center of gravity which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty So you can see it rotating here It weighs about a ton or over a ton It's made of stainless steel quite thick But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium It's susceptible to motion by the air currents This is another species of work that I do These are these arrays These spheres are all suspended but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses So all the red sides for example face one direction: south And the blue side the compliment faces the other way So as you turn around you're seeing different colors This is based on the structure of a diamond It was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows between the atoms And so I placed one more element of each one of them These were white spheres Then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres So they would catch parts of the images and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes as you walk through it through the object This is something I did of a tactile communication system It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a communication system This is an idea of moving a sculpture a ball that would be directed around the room by a computer This is a clock I designed It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth And then this is like projects that are harder to build This has a diamond-bottomed lake So it's a floating island with water fresh water that can fly from place to place This would be grown I suppose with nanotechnology in the future sometime In the course of doing my work I sort of have a broad range of interests And some of it is just the idea of creating media -- media as a sculpture something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of And I had a lot of -- always interested in the concept of a crystal ball And the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball and predict the future -- or a television set where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear I had thought about a long time ago in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations -- and other things that were happening the space program at that time and Whole Earth Catalog things like that I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites So if we could roll the next film here This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations But this the current version of it is a flying airship that is about 35 meters in diameter about 110 feet in diameter The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes red blue and green that allow you to have a high-resolution picture visible in daylight I came with a plan I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study and they analyzed it and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen This is the control room inside of the ship The idea of this air genie is it's something that can just transform and become anything It's like a traveling show It has speakers on it And it has cameras over the surface of it So it can see its environment and then it can mimic its environment and disappear Here the legs are retracting The cabin is open or closed as you like It weighs about 20 tons It has on-board generators It can generate about a million kilowatts in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting There would be on board a crew of artists musicians that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment and to interact as an entity that was aware that could communicate It's completely silent and nonpolluting It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with say going to a college campus and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences the world the situation of the globe The default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution Earth image But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation where the people could cut loose and the music and the lights and everything So it could land in a park for example Or this could represent a college green And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this And so interacting with the same kind of imagery It would also be able to be an open code so people could interact with it It would be forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type So that's pretty much it Okay Thank you What I want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that's sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst for lack of a better word over the past couple of years and basically these three quotes tell what's going on When God made the color purple God was just showing off Alice Walker wrote in The Color Purple and Zora Neale Hurston wrote in Dust Tracks On A Road Research is a formalized curiosity It's poking and prying with a purpose And then finally when I think about the near future you know we have this attitude well whatever happens happens Right So that goes along with the Chesire Cat saying If you don't care much where you want to get to it doesn't much matter which way you go But I think it does matter which way we go and what road we take because when I think about design in the near future what I think are the most important issues what's really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in 2002 If we describe the near future as 10 20 15 years from now that means that what we do today is going to be critically important because in the year 2015 and the year 2020 2025 the world our society is going to be building on the basic knowledge and abstract ideas the discoveries that we came up with today just as all these wonderful things we're hearing about here at the TED conference that we take for granted in the world right now were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the '50s the '60s and the '70s That's the substrate that we're exploiting today whether it's the internet guided missiles fiber optics high-definition television sensing remote-sensing from space and the wonderful remote-sensing photos that we see in 3D weaving TV programs like Tracker and Enterprise CD rewrite drives flatscreen Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis or Sarah Jones' Your Revolution Will Not Be Between These Thighs which by the way was banned by the FCC or ska all of these things without question almost without exception are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before so we have to ask ourselves what are we contributing to that legacy right now And when I think about it I'm really worried To be quite frank I'm concerned I'm skeptical that we're doing very much of anything We're in a sense failing to act in the future We're purposefully consciously being laggards We're lagging behind Frantz Fanon who was a psychiatrist from Martinique said Each generation must out of relative obscurity discover its mission and fulfill or betray it What is our mission What do we have to do I think our mission is to reconcile to reintegrate science and the arts because right now there's a schism that exists in popular culture You know people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate We think of them as separate and different things and this idea was probably introduced centuries ago but it's really becoming critical now because we're making decisions about our society every day that if we keep thinking that the arts are separate from the sciences and we keep thinking it's cute to say I don't understand anything about this one I don't understand anything about the other one then we're going to have problems Now I know no one here at TED thinks this All of us we already know that they're very connected but I'm going to let you know that some folks in the outside world believe it or not they think it's neat when they say You know scientists and science is not creative Maybe scientists are ingenious but they're not creative And then we have this tendency the career counselors and various people say things like Artists are not analytical They're ingenious perhaps but not analytical and when these concepts underly our teaching and what we think about the world then we have a problem because we By accepting this dichotomy whether it's tongue-in-cheek when we attempt to accommodate it in our world and we try to build our foundation for the world we're messing up the future because who wants to be uncreative Who wants to be illogical Talent would run from either of these fields if you said you had to choose either Then they're going to go to something where they think Well I can be creative and logical at the same time Now I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it actually my childhood spanned the '60s and I was a wannabe hippie and I always resented the fact that I wasn't really old enough to be a hippie And I know there are people here the younger generation who want to be hippies but people talk about the '60s all the time and they talk about the anarchy that was there but when I think about the '60s what I took away from it was that there was hope for the future We thought everyone could participate that were always percolating and so much of what's cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts whether it's you know people trying to use the prime directive from Star Trek being involved in things or again that fax machines that I read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started But the '60s left me with a problem You see I always assumed I would go into space because I followed all of this but I also loved the arts and sciences You see when I was growing up as a little girl and as a teenager I loved designing and making dogs' clothes and wanting to be a fashion designer I took art and ceramics I loved dance Lola Falana Alvin Ailey Jerome Robbins And I also avidly followed the Gemini and the Apollo programs I had science projects and tons of astronomy books I took calculus and philosophy I wondered about the infinity and the Big Bang theory And when I was at Stanford I found myself my senior year chemical engineering major half the folks thought I was a political science and performing arts major which was sort of true because I was Black Student Union President and I did major in some other things and I found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes logic classes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and also producing and choreographing a dance production and I had to do the lighting and the design work and I was trying to figure out do I go to New York City to try to become a professional dancer or do I go to medical school Now my mother helped me figure that one out But when I went into space when I went into space I carried a number of things up with me I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey which you can figure out now I love the dance company An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison performing the dance Cry dedicated to all black women everywhere A Bundu statue which was from the Women's Society in Sierra Leone and a certificate for the Chicago Public School students to work to improve their science and math and folks asked me Why did you take up what you took up And I had to say Because it represents human creativity required to have to conceive and build the same source as the imagination and analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue or the ingenuity it took to design choreograph and stage Cry Each one of them are different manifestations incarnations of creativity avatars of human creativity and that's what we have to reconcile in our minds how these things fit together The difference between arts and sciences is not analytical versus intuitive right E=MC squared required an intuitive leap and then you had to do the analysis afterwards Einstein said in fact The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious It is the source of all true art and science Dance requires us to express and want to express the jubilation in life but then you have to figure out exactly what movement do I do to make sure that it comes across correctly The difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive right A lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive You have to pull things apart And yeah sub-atomic physics is deconstructive You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them But sculpture from what I understand from great sculptors is deconstructive because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there Biotechnology is constructive Orchestral arranging is constructive So in fact we use constructive and deconstructive techniques in everything The difference between science are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they're manifestations of the same thing Different quantum states of an atom Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century I could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring But we'll leave that alone They spring from the same source The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity It's our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe the world around us It's our attempt to influence things the universe internal to ourselves and external to us The sciences to me are manifestations of our attempt to express or share our understanding our experience to influence the universe external to ourselves It doesn't rely on us as individuals It's the universe as experienced by everyone and the arts manifest our desire our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals Let me say it again another way: science provides an understanding of a universal experience and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience That's what we have to think about that they're all part of us they're all part of a continuum It's not just the tools it's not just the sciences you know the mathematics and the numerical stuff and the statistics because we heard very much on this stage people talked about music being mathematical Right Arts don't just use clay aren't the only ones that use clay light and sound and movement They use analysis as well So people might say well I still like that intuitive versus analytical thing because everybody wants to do the right brain left brain thing right right-brained or left-brained at some point in time depending on who we disagreed with You know people say intuitive you know that's like you're in touch with nature in touch with yourself and relationships Analytical: you put your mind to work and I'm going to tell you a little secret You all know this though but sometimes people use this analysis idea that things are outside of ourselves to be say that this is what we're going to elevate as the true most important sciences right And then you have artists and you all know this is true as well artists will say things about scientists because they say they're too concrete they're disconnected with the world But we've even had that here on stage so don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about this whole dichotomy that we continue to carry along even when we know better And folks say we need to choose either or But it would really be foolish to choose either one right Intuitive versus analytical That's a foolish choice It's foolish just like trying to choose between being realistic or idealistic You need both in life Why do people do this I'm just gonna quote a molecular biologist Sydney Brenner who's 70 years old so he can say this He said It's always important to distinguish between chastity and impotence Now。。 I want to share with you a little equation okay How do understanding science and the arts fit into our lives and what's going on and the things that we're talking about here at the design conference and this is a little thing I came up with understanding and our resources and our will cause us to have outcomes Our understanding is our science our arts our religion how we see the universe around us our resources our money our labor our minerals those things that are out there in the world we have to work with But more importantly there's our will This is our vision our aspirations of the future our hopes our dreams our struggles and our fears Our successes and our failures influence what we do with all of those and to me design and engineering craftsmanship and skilled labor are all the things that work on this to have our outcome which is our human quality of life Where do we want the world to be And guess what Regardless of how we look at this whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different they're both being influenced now and they're both having problems I did a project called S。E。E。ing the Future: Science Engineering and Education and it was looking at how to shed light on most effective use of government funding We got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers They came to Dartmouth College where I was teaching and they talked about with theologians and financiers what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research What's most important about it There are some ideas that emerged that I think have really powerful parallels to the arts The first thing they said was that the circumstances that we find ourselves in today in the sciences and engineering that made us world leaders is very different than the '40s the '50s and the '60s and the '70s when we emerged as world leaders because we're no longer in competition with fascism with Soviet-style communism and by the way that competition wasn't just military it included social competition and political competition as well that allowed us to look at space as one of those platforms to prove that our social system was better Another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences is becoming obsolete We look at universities and colleges small mid-sized community colleges across the country their laboratories are becoming obsolete and this is where we train most of our science workers and our researchers and our teachers by the way and then that there's a media that doesn't support the dissemination of any more than the most mundane and inane of information There's pseudo-science crop circles alien autopsy haunted houses or disasters And that's what we see And this isn't really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what's going on They also said that there's a change in the corporate mentality Whereas government money had always been there for basic science and engineering research we also counted on some companies to do some basic research but what's happened short-term product development than they do in basic engineering and science research And education is not keeping up In K through 12 people are taking out wet labs They think if we put a computer in the room it's going to take the place of actually we're mixing the acids we're growing the potatoes And government funding is decreasing in spending and then they're saying let's have corporations take over and that's not true Government funding should at least do things like recognize cost-benefits of basic science and engineering research We have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world We have to look at the education of humans We need to build our resources today to make sure that they're trained so that they understand the importance of these things and we have to support the vitality of science and that doesn't mean that everything has to have one thing that's going to go on or we know exactly what's going to be the outcome of it but that we support the vitality and the intellectual curiosity that goes along and if you think about those parallels to the arts the competition with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet to become better Infrastructure museums theaters movie houses across the country are disappearing We have more television stations with less to watch we have more money spent on rewrites to get old television programs in the movies We have corporate funding now that when it goes to some company when it goes to support the arts it almost requires that the product be part of the picture that the artist draws and we have stadiums that are named over and over again by corporations In Houston we're trying to figure out what to do with that Enron Stadium thing And fine arts and education in the schools is disappearing and we have a government that seems like it's gutting the NEA and other programs so we have to really stop and think what are we trying to do with the sciences and the arts There's a need to revitalize them We have to pay attention to it I just want to tell you really quickly what I'm doing I want to tell you what I've been doing a little bit since。。 I feel this need to sort of integrate some of the ideas that I've had and run across over time One of the things that I found out is that there's a need to repair the dichotomy between the mind and body as well My mother always told me you have to be observant know what's going on in your mind and your body and as a dancer I had this tremendous faith in my ability to know my body just as I knew how to sense colors Then I went to medical school and I was supposed to just go on what the machine said about bodies You know you would ask patients Don't don't don't listen to what the patients said We know that patients know and understand their bodies better but these days we're trying to divorce them from that idea We have to reconcile the patient's knowledge of their body with physician's measurements We had someone talk about measuring emotions and getting machines to figure out what to keep us from acting crazy Right No we shouldn't measure we shouldn't use machines to measure road rage and then do something to keep us from engaging in it Maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines We even need to be able to recognize that without the machines What I'm very concerned about is how do we bolster our self-awareness as humans as biological organisms Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes to see with my hands We have all kinds of possibilities to use our senses by and that's what we have to do bioinstrumentation those kind of things to help our senses in what we do and that's the work I've been doing now as a company called BioSentient Corporation I figured I'd have to do that ad because I'm an entrepreneur because entrepreneur says that that's somebody who does what they want to do because they're not broke enough that they have to get a real job But that's the work I'm doing with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things Let me finish by saying that my personal design issue for the future is really about integrating to think about that intuitive and that analytical The arts and sciences are not separate High school physics lesson before you leave High school physics teacher used to hold up a ball She would say this ball has potential energy but nothing will happen to it it can't do any work until I drop it and it changes states I like to think of ideas as potential energy They're really wonderful but nothing will happen until we risk putting them into action This conference is filled with wonderful ideas We're going to share lots of things with people but nothing's going to happen until we risk putting those ideas into action We need to revitalize the arts and sciences of today we need to take responsibility for the future We can't hide behind saying it's just for company profits or it's just a business or I'm an artist or an academician Here's how you judge what you're doing I talked about that balance between intuitive analytical Fran Lebowitz my favorite cynic she said the three questions of greatest concern now I'm going to add on to design is Is it attractive That's the intuitive Is it amusing The analytical And does it know its place The balance Thank you very much I thought I'd begin with a scene of war There was little to warn of the danger ahead The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED an Improvised Explosive Device along the side of the road with great care By 2006 there were more than 2，500 of these attacks every single month and they were the leading cause of casualties among American soldiers and Iraqi civilians The team that was hunting for this IED is called an EOD team— Explosives Ordinance Disposal—and they're the pointy end of the spear in the American effort to suppress these roadside bombs Each EOD team goes out on about 600 of these bomb calls every year defusing about two bombs a day Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the Iraqi insurgents put a $50，000 bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier Unfortunately this particular call would not end well By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb it exploded in a wave of flame Now depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb it can cause death or injury You have to be as far as 50 yards away to escape that The blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you're not hit That soldier had been on top of the bomb And so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left And that night the unit's commander did a sad duty and he wrote a condolence letter back to the United States and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier a soldier who had saved their lives many a time And he apologized for not being able to bring them home But then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss At least as he wrote when a robot dies you don't have to write a letter to its mother That scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already The soldier in that case The chief's letter went not to some farmhouse in Iowa like you see in the old war movies but went to the iRobot Company which is named after the Asimov novel and the not-so-great Will Smith movie and。。 um。。 。。 if you remember that in that fictional world robots started out carrying out mundane chores and then they started taking on life-and-death decisions That's a reality we face today What we're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage It's just to give you a taste Another way of putting it is you're not going to see anything that's powered by Vulcan technology or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that This is all real So why don't we go ahead and start those pictures Something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself The U。S military went into Iraq with a handful of drones in the air We now have 5，300 We went in with zero unmanned ground systems We now have 12，000 And the tech term killer application takes on new meaning in this space And we need to remember that we're talking about the Model T Fords the Wright Flyers compared to what's coming soon That's where we're at right now One of the people that I recently met with was an Air Force three-star general and he said basically where we're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we're not just talking about tens of thousands of today's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow's robots because of course one of the things that's operating in technology is Moore's Law that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around 25 years if Moore's Law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today And so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like Comic-Con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the Pentagon A robots revolution is upon us Now I need to be clear here I'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the Governor of California showing up at your door a la the Terminator When historians look at this period they're going to conclude that we're in a different type of revolution: a revolution in war like the invention of the atomic bomb But it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems don't just affect the how of war-fighting they affect the who of fighting at its most fundamental level That is every previous revolution in war be it the machine gun be it the atomic bomb was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom That's certainly the case with robotics but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior Another way of putting this is that mankind's 5，000-year-old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime I've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting from Nevada to the four-star generals who command them to even the Iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems and what I found interesting is not just their stories but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society in our law and our ethics etc And so what I'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these So the first is that the future of war even a robotics one is not going to be purely an American one The U。S is currently ahead in military robotics right now but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage In a quick show of hands how many people in this room still use Wang Computers It's the same thing in war The British and the French invented the tank The Germans figured out how to use it right and so what we have to think about for the U。S is that we are ahead right now but you have 43 other countries out there working on military robotics and they include all the interesting countries like Russia China Pakistan Iran And this raises a bigger worry for me How do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools Or another way of thinking about this is what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in China and software is written in India But just as software has gone open-source so has warfare Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb you don't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics A lot of it is off the shelf A lot of it's even do-it-yourself One of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone the handheld tossed one For about a thousand dollars you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in Iraq That raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict Good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits but so might bad guys This cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing and we've already seen it start During the war between Israel a state and Hezbollah a non-state actor the non-state actor flew four different drones against Israel There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting at your home computer And so I think what we're going to see is two trends take place with this First is you're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism The future of it may be a cross between al Qaeda 2。0 and the next generation of the Unabomber And another way of thinking about this is the fact that remember you don't have to convince a robot that they're gonna receive 72 virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up But the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics One of the people that I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Ronald Reagan and he put it this way: I like these systems because they save American lives but I worry about more marketization of wars more shock-and-awe talk to defray discussion of the costs People are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless Robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic and maybe take them to their logical ending point We don't have a draft We don't have declarations of war anymore We don't buy war bonds anymore And now we have the fact that we're converting more and more of our American soldiers that we would send into harm's way into machines and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground But the future of war is also going to be a YouTube war That is our new technologies don't merely remove humans from risk They also record everything that they see So they don't just delink the public: they reshape its relationship with war There's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from Iraq on YouTube right now most of it gathered by drones Now this could be a good thing It could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before But remember this is taking place in our strange weird world and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your iPod or your Zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment Soldiers have a name for these clips They call it war porn The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site Missile hits bodies burst into the air with the explosion It was set to music It was set to the pop song This ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public's relationship with war I think about this with a sports parallel It's like the difference between watching an NBA game a professional basketball game on TV where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like But we have to remember these are just the clips These are just the ESPN SportsCenter They lose the strategy They lose the humanity War just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs Now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines it's our human psychology that's driving all of this it's our human failings that are leading to these wars So one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we're fighting against radical groups What is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message So one of the people that I met was a senior Bush Administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war: It plays to our strength The thing that scares people is our technology But when you go out and meet with people for example in Lebanon it's a very different story One of the people I met with there was a news editor and we're talking as a drone is flying above him and this is what he had to say This is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel Israelis and Americans who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us They don't want to fight us like real men but they're afraid to fight so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers to defeat them The future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior and it's actually redefining the experience of going to war You can call this a cubicle warrior described of his experience fighting in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada You're going to war for 12 hours shooting weapons at targets directing kills on enemy combatants and then you get in the car and you drive home and within 20 minutes you're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework Now the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of PTSD than many of the units physically in Iraq But some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else crimes a lot easier when you have this distance It's like a video game is what one young pilot described to me of taking out enemy troops from afar As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto knows we do things in the video world that we wouldn't do face to face So much of what you're hearing from me is that there's another side to technologic revolutions and that it's shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war Moore's Law is operative but so's Murphy's Law The fog of war isn't being lifted The enemy has a vote We're gaining incredible new capabilities but we're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas Now sometimes these are just oops moments which is what the head of a robotics company described it you just have oops moments Well what are oops moments with robots in war Well sometimes they're funny Sometimes they're like that scene from the Eddie Murphy movie Best Defense playing out in reality where they tested out a machine gun-armed robot and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of VIPs Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded and no one was hurt but other times oops moments are tragic such as last year in South Africa where an anti-aircraft cannon had a software glitch and actually did turn on and fired and nine soldiers were killed We have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability What do we do with things like unmanned slaughter What is unmanned slaughter We've already had three instances of Predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin Laden and it turned out not to be the case And this is where we're at right now This is not even talking about armed autonomous systems with full authority to use force And do not believe that that isn't coming During my research I came across four different Pentagon projects on different aspects of that And so you have this question: what does this lead to issues like war crimes Robots are emotionless so they don't get upset if their buddy is killed They don't commit crimes of rage and revenge But robots are emotionless They see an 80-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a T-80 tank: they're both just a series of zeroes and ones And so we have this question to figure out: How do we catch up our 20th century laws of war that are so old right now that they could qualify for Medicare to these 21st century technologies And so in conclusion I've talked about what seems the future of war but notice that I've only used real world examples and you've only seen real world pictures and videos And so this sets a great challenge for all of us that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your Roomba sucking the life away from you Are we going to let the fact that what's unveiling itself right now in war sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial Are we going to face the reality of 21st century war Is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry and not deal with the issues that surround it until Pandora's box is already opened up Now I could be wrong on this and one Pentagon robot scientist told me that I was He said There's no real social ethical moral issues when it comes to robots That is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly Then it's just a product recall issue And so the ending point for this is that actually we can turn to Hollywood A few years ago Hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top 100 heroes and top 100 villains of all of Hollywood history the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity Only one character made it onto both lists: The Terminator a robot killing machine And so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil but for me it points to the fact that there's a duality of humans as well This week is a celebration of our creativity Our creativity has taken our species to the stars Our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love And now we're using our creativity in a certain direction to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities maybe even one day an entirely new species But one of the main reasons that we're doing that is because of our drive to destroy each other and so the question we all should ask: is it our machines or is it us that's wired for war Thank you I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times I review gadgets and stuff And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question: What are the tech trends for next year And I'm like Didn't we just go through this last year But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet You know I found that volcano on Google Images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics Anyway this all started a few years ago when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line and we've come a long way since that But that was interesting in itself This is companies like Vonage Basically you take an ordinary telephone you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem Now it works just like a regular phone So you can pick up the phone you hear a dial tone but its just a fake-out It's a WAV file of a dial tone just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended It could be anything It could be salsa music or a comedy routine -- it doesn't matter The little box has your phone number So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring because it's got everything in the box They've got every feature known to man in there because adding a new feature is just software And as a result of Voice Over IP -- I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet -- land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years I mean no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore This is what college kids are more likely to have It's the most popular VOIP service in the world: It's Skype It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd It's not your phone -- it's your computer But nonetheless if you're a college kid and you have no money believe me this is better than trying to use your cell phone It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me try out Skype for the first time which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad They don't want to pay the international fees so they're like Timmy Is that you It's really cute But I -- at least it was when I did it -- I think where VOIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickel It'd be really really cool -- and yet even though the technology for this has been available for five years incredibly the number of standard cell phones offered by US carriers with free VOIP is zero I can't figure out why Actually I need to update that There's one now And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it It comes from T-Mobile And I am not paid by T-Mobile I'm not plugging T-Mobile The New York Times has very rigid policies about that Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us Basically the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June 29 Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year It was the iPhone The iPhone came out that day I'm like can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady You know Hi we have an announcement to -- WAH！！ But it's actually really really cool You have a choice of phones and we're not talking smartphones -- ordinary phones including a Blackberry that have Wi-Fi The deal is any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot all your calls are free And when you're out of the hotspot you're on the regular cellular network You're thinking Well how often am I in a hotspot The answer is All the time Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone for your house Which is really ingenious because we all know that T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers Right They don't have that kind of money Instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box They're like a stealth tower installation program We're putting it in our homes for them Anyway they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before is when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range the call is handed off in mid-syllable seamlessly I'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear going like this As I walk out of the house from my Wi-Fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife -- look at the upper left That's the Wi-Fi signal Jennifer Pogue: Hello David Pogue: Hi babes it's me JP: Oh hi darling how are you DP: You're on Wi-Fi How does it sound JP: Oh it sounds pretty good Now I'm leaving the house DP: I'm going for a walk -- do you mind JP: No not at all I'm having a great day with the kids DP: What are you guys doing It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her I don't get that The bottom line is that the boundaries because of the Internet plus cell phone are melting The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones is that although switching technologies is very advanced the billing technology has not caught up So what I mean is that you can start a call in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead -- which would be like 10 minutes -- And the call will continue to be free Because they don't they haven't -- well no wait Not so fast It also works the other way So if you start a call on your cellular network and you come home you keep being billed Which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying Hey I just got home Can I call you right back Now you get it It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog right Nobody knows you're in Pakistan You can make free unlimited calls home to the US with these phones So very very interesting This is another favorite of mine Does anyone here have a working cell phone that's on with coverage who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing OK Would you call me please right now Phone number given And don't you all call me at three a。m asking me to fix your printer I have two cell phones so this going to be very odd if it works I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience It's just like absurd This one is going off And -- oh I have the ringer off Tsh Great Anyway this one is also going off So they're both ringing at the same time Excuse me one second Hello Oh Where are you calling from No no just kidding There he is Thank you very much for doing that I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy Oh great Yeah Yeah you can all stop calling now All right We've made the point All right Ringer off Everyone wants in on the action So this is Grand Central at work -- it's a -- oh for gods sake I have your numbers now You will pay Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once Your home phone your work phone your cell phone your yacht phone I know a lot of you are like Ooh I don't want to be reached at any hour But the beauty is it's all going through the internet so you get all of these really cool features -- like you can say I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours And I want these people to hear this greeting Hi boss I'm out making us both some money Leave a message And then your wife calls and Hi honey leave me a message Very very customizable Google bought it and they've been working on it for a year They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method By the way this is something that really bothers me I don't know if you realize this When you call 411 on your cell phone they charge you two bucks Did you know that It's an outrage I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now What you're going to use is Google Cellular It's totally free -- there's not even ads If you know how to send a text message you can get the same information for free I'm about to change your life So here's me doing it You send a text message to the word Google which turns out to be 46645 Leave off the last e for savings Anyway so lets say you need a drugstore near Chicago You type pharmacy Chicago or the zip code You hit send and in five seconds they will send you back the two closest drugstores complete with name address and phone number Here it comes And it's already written down -- so like if you're driving you don't have to do one of these things Uh huh uh huh uh huh It works with weather too You can say Weather and the name of the city you're going to travel to And then in five seconds they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan Here we go And those are just the beginning These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will -- yeah You're all trying to write this down That's cute I do have an email address You can just ask me It's absolutely phenomenal The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message Nobody over 40 knows how to do that So I'm going to teach you something even better This is called Google Info They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing It's speech recognition like you've never heard before So lets say I'm in Monterey and I want what I want to find what Bagels OK Google: Say the business and the city and state DP: Bagels Monterey California I got the Chinese line Google: Bagels Monterey California Top eight results: Number one Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street To select number one you can press one or say number one Number two: Bagel Bakery commissary department Number Two Number Two Two Why do I listen to people in the audience Well anyway -- oh Here we go Google: 。。 commissary department on McClellan Avenue Monterey I'll connect you or say details or go back DP: He's connecting me He doesn't even tell me the phone number He's just connecting me directly It's like having a personal valet Google: Hold on DP: Hi could I have 400 with a schmear No no no -- just kidding no no So anyway you never even find out the number It's just so amazing And it has incredible incredible accuracy This is even more amazing Put this in your speed dial This you can ask by voice any question Who won the 1958 World Series What's the recipe for a certain cocktail It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive Which actors have played James Bond They text me back this: Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Pierce Brosnan Daniel Craig Right And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl I'm like What's the word that means you know like when the sun the moon and the earth are like all in a line Just to see how the recognition was They texted me back It's called a syzygy Which I knew because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976 You know there's a lot of people wondering How on earth are they going to make money doing this And the answer is: look at the last line They put this teeny-weeny little ad about 10 characters long And a lot of people also want to know How does it work How can it be so good It's as though there is a human being on the other end of the line Because there is one They have 10，000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer As you can imagine it's college kids and old people That's who can afford to do that But it's a human being on the line And it's gotten me out of so many tough positions like When's the last flight out of Chicago You know It's just absolutely amazing Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today -- this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology When I call to leave you a message I get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on Ambien To page this person 。。 Page What is this 1975 Nobody has pagers anymore You may begin speaking at the tone When you have finished recording you may hang up No And then it gets worse: when I call to retrieve my messages first of all: You have 87 messages To listen to your messages 。。 Why else am I calling Of course I want to listen to the messages Oh You all have cell phones too So last year I went to Milan Italy and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world And I said as a joke -- as a joke I said I did the math Verizon has 70 million customers If you check your voicemail twice a day that's 100 million dollars a year I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime aren't you Where is the outrage people Rise up Sorry I'm not bitter So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone It is a life-changer And by the way they don't always get the words right because it's over the phone and all that So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double-check The services are called things like Spinvox Phonetag -- this is the one I use -- Callwave A lot of people say How are they doing this I don't really want people listening in to my calls The executives at these companies told me Well we use a proprietary B-to-B best-of-breed peer-to-peer soluti -- you know I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets you know listening in The reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services I got two voicemail messages One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe and it was misspelled The other was from my video producer at the Times whose name is Vijaiy Singh So you be the judge Anyway this service Callwave promises that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages So I thought I'd see how that goes This is me testing it out Hello this is Michael Hope you're doing well I'm fine here Everything's good Hey I was walking along the street and the sky was blue And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch She's in room -- emergency room 53W OK talk to you later -- bye I love my job So a couple minutes later this I got by email It's a very good transcription But a couple minutes after that I got the text message version Now remember a text message can only be 160 characters long So it had better be the gist of the gist right I'm not kidding you The message said Was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency What the f -- Well I guess that was the gist And lastly I just have to talk about this one This is my favorite of all time It's called Popularitydialer。com Basically you're going to go on some iffy date or a potentially bad meeting So you go and you type in your phone number and at the exact minute where you want to be called -- And at that moment your phone will ring And you're like I'm sorry I've got to take this The really beautiful thing is you know how when somebody's sitting next to you sometimes they can sort of hear a little bit of the caller So they give you a choice of what you want to hear on the other end Here's the girlfriend Phone: Hey you what's going on DP: I'm kinda like giving a talk right now Phone: Well that's good DP: What are you doing Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to DP: Right I can't really talk right now This is the -- I love this -- the boss call Phone: Hey this is Mr Johnson calling from the office DP: Oh hi sir Phone: Did you complete that thing about a month ago That photocopier training DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot Phone: Yeah well so when was the last time you used the photocopier DP: It was like three weeks ago Phone: Well I don't know if you heard you might have heard from Lenny but -- I think the biggest change when Internet met phone was with the iPhone Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism It was when in the fall of 2006 I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone I looked like a moron However my logic was good because -- I don't know if you realize this but -- until the iPhone came along the carriers -- Verizon AT&amp;T Cingular -- held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone I know the people who worked on the Treo They went around to these carriers and said Look at these cool features And Verizon is like Hmm no I don't think so It was not very conducive to innovation What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace -- and you won't even see it till it's done Actually even so he was turned down by Verizon and others Finally Cingular said OK I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go What are you An Apple fan boy you know I'm not You can see what I said about it It's a flawed masterpiece It's got bad things and good things Lets all acknowledge that right now But it did change a few things The first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold 10 million of these things in a year And they said Oh my gosh maybe we've been doing it wrong Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones Another thing was that it let 10 million people for the first time experience being online all the time Not using these 60-dollar-a-month cellular cards for their laptops I don't understand why we're not there yet When I'm an old man I'm going to tell my grandchildren When I was your age if I wanted to check my email I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop I did We had wireless base stations that could broadcast -- yay about 150 feet across It's absurd We have power outlets in every room of every building We have running water What's the problem Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like You have to go to YouTube and type in iPhone Shuffle This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square like the real iPod Shuffle It's like It only has one button Touch it and it dials a number at random Who the hell is this But the other thing it did is it opened up this idea of an app store It downloads right to the phone And you can use the tilt sensor These programs can use all the components of the iPhone -- the touch screen This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008 You know how you erase it Of course You shake it Right of course We shake it to erase like this They have 10，000 of these programs This is the translator program They have every language in the world You type in what you want and it gives you the translation This is amazing This is Midomi A song is running through your head -- you sing it into the thing: OK you tap Done and it will find out the song and play it for you I know It's insane right This is Pandora Free Internet radio Not just free Internet radio -- you type in a band or a song name It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down You say if you like this song or not If you like it it tries another song on you from a different band with the same instrumentation vocals theme and tempo If you like that one or don't like it you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs It eventually only plays songs you like This is Urbanspoon You're in a city It knows from GPS where you're standing You want to find a place to eat You shake it It proposes a restaurant It gives you the price and the location and ratings I'm not going all the way to Flushing Anyway just amazing amazing things Of course its not just about the iPhone The iPhone broke the dyke the wall But now it's everybody else So Google has done their own Android operating system that will soon be on handsets -- phones from 34 companies Touch screen -- very very nice Also with its own app store where you can download programs This is amazing In the wake of all this Verizon the most calcified corporate conservative carrier of all said You can use any phone you want on our network I love the Wired headline: Pigs Fly Hell Freezes Over and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No Really So everything is changing We've entered a new world of innovation where the cell phone becomes your laptop customized the way you want it Every cell phone is unique There is software that you can add on Can I do one more one-minute song Thank you Just to round it up -- this is the new Apple Power Music Stand It's only three pounds or 12 if you install Microsoft Office Sorry that was mean This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video Ladies and gentlemen for seven blissful hours it was the number one video on YouTube And now the end is near I'm sick to death of this old cell phone Bad sound the signal's weak the software stinks A made-in-Hell phone a million times more rad than my phone I too will join the cult I want an iPhone Concerns -- I have a few It's got some flaws; we may just face it No keys no memory card the battery's sealed -- you can't replace it But God this thing is sweet A multitouch iPod Wi-Fi phone You had me from Hello I want an iPhone I want to touch its precious screen I want to wipe the smudges clean I want my friends to look and drool I want to say Look -- now I'm cool I stood in line and I'll get mine I want an iPhone For what is a man What has he got If not iPhone then he's got squat It's all the things a phone should be Who cares if it's AT&amp;T I took a stand paid half a grand And I got an iPhone Thank you Thank you very much I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well what wasn't and making it kind of an annual thing A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally That is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist Any tough problem I think it can be solved And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past Over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled Another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths As recently as 1960 110 million children were born and 20 million of those died before the age of five Five years ago 135 million children were born -- so more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate It's a phenomenal thing Each one of those lives matters a lot And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs: vaccines that were used more widely For example measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as 1990 and now is under 400，000 So we really can make changes The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again And I think that's doable in well under 20 years Why Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea pneumonia and malaria So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos Well what's the history of this disease It's been a severe disease for thousands of years In fact if we look at the genetic code it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s So it was absolutely gigantic And the disease was all over the world A terrible disease It was in the United States It was in Europe People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos So it was everywhere And two tools helped bring the death rate down One was killing the mosquitos with DDT The other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives And so that's why the death rate did come down Now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where the rich countries are So we can see: 1900 it's everywhere 1945 it's still most places 1970 the U。S and most of Europe have gotten rid of it 1990 you've gotten most of the northern areas And more recently you can see it's just around the equator And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries it doesn't get much investment For example there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria Now baldness it's a terrible thing And rich men are afflicted And so that's why that priority has been set But malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much Now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos I brought some here just so you could experience this We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit There's no reason only poor people should have the experience Those mosquitos are not infected So we've come up with a few new things We've got bed nets And bed nets are a great tool What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent And that's happened now in a number of countries It's great to see But we have to be careful because malaria -- the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective And so you end up with two choices If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking Or if you go in kind of half-heartedly for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention Now we're on the upswing Bed net funding is up There's new drug discovery going on Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective So we're going to have these new tools But that alone doesn't give us the road map Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things It involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories It involves social scientists so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets but 90 percent We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things And so as these elements come together I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria Now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but I'd say equally important And this is: How do you make a teacher great It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and we'd understand very well And the answer is really that we don't Let's start with why this is important Well all of us here I'll bet had some great teachers We all had a wonderful education That's part of the reason we're here today part of the reason we're successful I can say that even though I'm a college drop-out I had great teachers In fact in the United States the teaching system has worked fairly well There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top 20 percent And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U。S at the forefront Now the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting Not only has that been weak it's getting weaker And if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education And we have to change this We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics When I first learned the statistics I was pretty stunned at how bad things are Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that But most of the dropouts had taken place before that They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent For minority kids it's over 50 percent And even if you graduate from high school if you're low-income you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree If you're low-income in the United States you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree And that doesn't seem entirely fair So how do you make education better Now our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this There's many people working on it We've worked on small schools we've funded scholarships we've done things in libraries A lot of these things had a good effect But the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile How much variation is there within a school or between schools And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test scores -- by over 10 percent in a single year What does that mean That means that if the entire U。S。 for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and Asia would go away Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away So it's simple All you need are those top quartile teachers And so you'd say Wow we should reward those people We should retain those people We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today What are the characteristics of this top quartile What do they look like You might think these must be very senior teachers And the answer is no Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter The variation is very very small You might think these are people with master's degrees They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality That bottom thing which says there's no effect at all is a master's degree Now the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded One is seniority Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher Teach for America: slight effect For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect But overwhelmingly it's your past performance There are some people who are very good at this And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system You might say Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave The answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system And it's a system with very high turnover Now there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP KIPP means Knowledge Is Power It's an unbelievable thing They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching They take the poorest kids and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools They're team teaching They're constantly improving their teachers They're taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher Hey you caused this amount of increase They're deeply engaged in making teaching better When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first it's very bizarre I sat down and I thought What is going on The teacher was running around and the energy level was high I thought I'm in the sports rally or something What's going on And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board It was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade -- keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there Everybody needs to be involved And so KIPP is doing it How does that compare to a normal school Well in a normal school teachers aren't told how good they are The data isn't gathered In the teacher's contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year And they need advanced notice to do that So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told Hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it They don't have the test scores and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data For example New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction But I'm optimistic about this I think there are some clear things we can do First of all there's a lot more testing going on and that's given us the picture of where we are And that allows us to understand who's doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are Of course digital video is cheap now Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say OK here's a little clip of something I thought I did well Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly Advise me -- when this kid acted up how should I have dealt with that And they could all sit and work together on those problems You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that If you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept And in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet but you could make it so that DVDs were always available and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers And so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better Now there's a book actually about KIPP -- the place that this is going on -- that Jay Matthews a news reporter wrote -- called Work Hard Be Nice And I thought it was so fantastic It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book Now we put a lot of money into education the House version actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things But I -- I'm optimistic I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is I only had time to frame those two problems There's a lot more problems like that -- AIDS pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited just at the very name of these things And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad You know the system doesn't naturally make it happen Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things get other people involved -- and you're helping to come up with solutions And with that I think there's some great things that will come out of it Thank you My work is play And I play when I design I even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that I actually do that and the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor and number two was gambling And I realize I do both when I'm designing I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time And I think that if you're not there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in if you're a designer But the serious part is what threw me and I couldn't quite get a handle on it until I remembered an essay And it's an essay I read 30 years ago It was written by Russell Baker who used to write an Observer column in the New York Times He's a wonderful humorist And I'm going to read you this essay or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me Here is a letter of friendly advice Be serious it says What it means of course is be solemn Being solemn is easy Being serious is hard Children almost always begin by being serious which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class Adults on the whole are solemn In politics the rare candidate who is serious like Adlai Stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like Eisenhower That's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness which is rare but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which is commonplace Jogging which is commonplace and widely accepted as good for you is solemn Poker is serious Washington D。C is solemn New York is serious Going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn Taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's is serious Now when I apply Russell Baker's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality Solemn design is often important and very effective design Solemn design is also socially correct and is accepted by appropriate audiences It's what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for Serious design serious play is something else For one thing it often happens spontaneously intuitively accidentally or incidentally It can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness But mostly it's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don't really make any sense Serious design is imperfect It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view That's because the art of serious play is about invention change rebellion -- not perfection Perfection happens during solemn play Now I always saw design careers like surreal staircases If you look at the staircase you'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high and the steps are very short and you make huge discoveries You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you're just jumping right up there As you get older the risers get shallower and the steps get wider and you start moving along at a slower pace because you're making fewer discoveries And as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious I'm hired to be solemn but I find more and more that I'm solemn when I don't have to be And in my 35 years of working experience I think I was really serious four times And I'm going to show them to you now because they came out of very specific conditions It's great to be a kid Now when I was in my early 20s I worked in the record business designing record covers for CBS Records and I had no idea what a great job I had I thought everybody had a job like that And what -- the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time I walked into design were the enemy I really really really hated the typeface Helvetica I thought the typeface Helvetica was the cleanest most boring most fascistic really repressive typeface and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica And when I was in my college days this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak but I just hated it because it was designed with Helvetica and I made parodies about it I just thought it was you know completely boring So -- so my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s There weren't -- there wasn't a plethora of design publishing You actually had to go to antique stores You had to go to Europe You had to go places and find the stuff And what I responded to was you know Art Nouveau or deco or Victorian typography or things that were just completely not Helvetica And I taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and I used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design I wasn't educated I just sort of put these things together I mixed up Victorian designs with pop and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else And I made these very lush very elaborate record covers not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because I didn't know what those things were I just hated Helvetica And that kind of passion drove me into very serious play a kind of play I could never do now because I'm too well-educated And there's something wonderful about that form of youth where you can let yourself grow and play and be really a brat and then accomplish things By the end of the '70s actually the stuff became known I mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and people knew them And I was suddenly a post-modernist and I began a career as -- in my own business And first I was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was I had become solemn I didn't do what I think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn turning out these sorts of designs that I was expected to do because that's who I was and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and getting rediscovered all over again So here was the second condition for which I think I accomplished some serious play There's a Paul Newman movie that I love called The Verdict I don't know how many of you have seen it but it's a beaut And in the movie he plays a down-and-out lawyer who's become an ambulance chaser And he's taken on -- he's given actually -- a malpractice suit to handle that's sort of an easy deal and in the midst of trying to connect the deal he starts to empathize and identify with his client and he regains his morality and purpose and he goes on to win the case And in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it looks like he can't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly There's a shot of Paul Newman alone in his office saying This is the case There are no other cases This is the case There are no other cases And in that moment of desire and focus he can win And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play And I had that moment in 1994 when I met a theater director named George Wolfe who was going to have me design an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival then known and then became the Public Theater And I began getting immersed in this project in a way I never was before This is what theater advertising looked like at that time This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times So this is sort of a comment on the time And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this They had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic posters painted by Paul Davis And George Wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive So drawing on my love of typography I immersed myself into this project And what was different about it was the totality of it was that I really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way I had never done before where every aspect -- the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was -- was designed by me There was no format There was no in-house department that these things were pushed to I literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper everything online that this theater did And it was the only job even though I was doing other jobs I lived and breathed it in a way I haven't with a client since It enabled me to really express myself and grow And I think that you know when you're going to be given this position and it's rare but when you get it and you have this opportunity it's the moment of serious play I did these things and I still do them I still work for the Public Theater I'm on their board and I still am involved with it The high point of the Public Theater I think was in 1996 two years after I designed it which was the Bring in 'da Noise Bring in 'da Funk campaign that was all over New York But something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular And that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn And what happened was that New York City to a degree ate my identity because people began to copy it Here's an ad in the New York Times somebody did for a play called Mind Games Then Chicago came out used similar graphics and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away which meant I had to change it So I changed it so that every season was different and I continued to do these posters but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they didn't have that heft of everything being the same thing Now -- and I think since the Public Theater I must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions and I don't think I ever -- I ever grasped that seriousness again -- I do them for very big important institutions in New York City The institutions are solemn and so is the design They're better crafted than the Public Theater was and they spend more money on them but I think that that moment comes and goes The best way to accomplish serious design -- which I think we all have the opportunity to do -- is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job That doesn't happen very often but it happened to me in the year 2000 when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings I'd never done this kind of work before I didn't know how to read an architectural plan I didn't know what they were talking about and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because I was used to immediacy in graphic design and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me with ADD So it was a rough -- it was a rough go but I fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because I didn't know what I was doing I said Why can't the signage be on the floor New Yorkers look at their feet And then I found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways They ran around corners they went up sides of buildings and they melded into the architecture This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics And the architect Jim Polshek essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on And it was serious play This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania made out of completely inexpensive materials Extruded typography that's backlit with neon Things I never did before built before I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do Donors' walls made out of Lucite And then inexpensive signage I think my favorite of these was this little job in Newark New Jersey It's a performing arts school This is the building that -- they had no money and they had to recast it and they said if we give you 100，000 dollars what can you do with it And I did a little Photoshop job on it and I said Well I think we can paint it And we did And it was play And there's the building Everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing including the air conditioning ducts I hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building and they loved it They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously They used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography -- that my spacing was wrong and they moved it and they did wonderful things with it They were pretty serious too It was quite wonderful By the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted People wanted it in big expensive places And that began to make it solemn Bloomberg was all about numbers and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED that my partner Lisa Strausfeld programmed But it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn This is a current project in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania where I got to be goofy I was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood called the North Side and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo I think that's rather creepy actually Why would a neighborhood have a logo A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark it's got a place it's got a restaurant It doesn't have a logo I mean what would that be So I had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents and I went to Pittsburgh and I said You know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town Why don't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks So I began doing this crazy presentation of these installations -- potential installations -- on these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council -- and was a little bit scared I have to admit But I was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief so desperately that I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just completely because it was so goofy to begin with And this is the bridge they're actually painting up and preparing as we speak It will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the North Side of Pittsburgh and it will probably become a landmark in the area John Hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with Citibank that is now a 10-year relationship and I still work with them And I actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice I drew the logo for Citibank on a napkin in the first meeting That was the play part of the job And then I spent a year going to long tedious boring meetings trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears I thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year We made idiotic presentations showing how the Citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth And it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it's so internationally recognizable but for me it was actually a very very depressing year As a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until Fallon put it on its very good Live Richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all over the world So during this time I needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings And I was up in my country house and for some reason I began painting these very big very involved laborious complicated maps of the entire world and listing every place on the planet and putting them in and misspelling them and putting things in the wrong spot and completely controlling the information and going totally and completely nuts with it They would take me about six months initially but then I started getting faster at it Here's the United States Every single city of the United States is on here And it hung for about eight months at the Cooper-Hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they'd say Oh I've been here And of course they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot But what I liked about it was I was controlling my own idiotic information and I was creating my own palette of information and I was totally and completely at play One of my favorites was this painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water I keep that for evidence Somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery and I had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago and I showed these paintings that I'm showing you now And then a funny thing happened -- they sold And they sold quickly and became rather popular We started making prints from them This is Manhattan one from the series This is a print from the United States which we did in red white and blue We began doing these big silkscreen prints and they started selling too So the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years which meant that I really had to paint these paintings much faster than I had ever done them And I -- they started to become more political and I picked areas that sort of were in the news or that I had some feeling about and I began doing these things And then this funny thing happened I found that I was no longer at play I was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show which is not where I started with these things So while they became successful I know how to make them so I'm not a neophyte and they're no longer serious -- they have become solemn And that's a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about that you can fail with and that you can be a fool with Because in the end that's how you grow and that's all that matters So I'm plugging along here -- and I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase Thank you very much Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties Over the last three years we found over 200 of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED Of these six the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech Now go ahead and open it up Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart What's unexpected about this is that it's soft but it's also a strong magnet Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this We spent a long time thinking about why this is and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work ZK: Now it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world So a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed Imagine taking the same material but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker You know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf For me I really love this idea If you come to my apartment and see my closet I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L。A。 and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company The Directors Bureau As we were talking Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know we shared the same ideas And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on These things just get him really excited And so we're looking at these concepts and we were just like whoa this guy's good Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now When we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking: why was this so powerful And as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience just as if you saw it on TV So for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future Do you have a need for speed Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast so tall that when you hit the bottom it uses brakes to stop Aqua Rocket: coming this summer Now we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when's it coming out So I just wanted to let you know it's not actually coming out just the concept is ZK: So now when we dream up these concepts it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint So I just want to quickly explain how this would work This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board Now this is important for two reasons One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn't injure him In addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down The force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system When you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it's not a magnetic material But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you Now you see the magnet fell really slowly Now I'm not going to get into the physics of it but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling the greater the stopping force ZK: Now our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole and I have it right here in my pocket There're a few different versions of it Some of them automatically unroll like this one They can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like Zach's to hold any position in between ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these or how they're being applied currently -- he was telling us that in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then when they're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base In our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal: so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag Now the interesting thing about this is you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way I'd make my very own walking stick I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree An olive server Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use I would make a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier 。。 Yeah ZK: Now for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience You sir come on up Come on up Tell everybody your name Steve Jurvetson: Steve ZK: It's Steve All right Steve now follow me We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign Right there That's great And hold onto this Good luck to you No not yet ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target Little bit -- that's perfect just perfect Now Zach we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future So here come on up to the front All right so now if you'll see here -- no no it's OK So describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt Go ahead SJ: It's cold Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M It's perfectly clear it's odorless it's colorless It's so safe you could drink this stuff And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water All right well thanks for coming up ZK: Wait wait Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends SJ: Excellent thank you Thanks for coming up Let's give him a big round of applause So what's the significance of this dry liquid Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer Now the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics that we'd get him wet that we'd hurt the books or the computers It works because it's non-conductive So you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage You can circulate it to draw the heat away But today it's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid Again it's perfectly safe for people It puts out the fires doesn't hurt anything But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game So during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry Wouldn't hurt the court ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical One of their R&amp;D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer While he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing We have a video to show you So you see there it didn't bounce back Now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing It's technically called shape-retaining property Now think about your interactions with aluminum foil Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back ZK: For example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but doesn't use a buckle Taking it a little further if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away For our next technology it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it's an ink So we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper As this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes So with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent Now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games Any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book This could totally change the way that you interface with paper You see the dark line on the side and the top As you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you're on based on the curvature of the pages In addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes For our last technology we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah it smells good Who are you New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk OMC: I used to smell like you Fresh Watch from Inventables Dairy Farms Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off Don't let milk spoil your morning ZK: Now this technology was developed by these two guys: Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow of the University of Illinois Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes And these dyes change color in response to odors So the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells But like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor ZK: Right It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond just detecting spoiled food It's really where the significance of it lies His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene And he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen it was OK to go I mean this is a true story They're using policemen as canaries But more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans and say if it's safe for the firemen In addition he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing where they're working on medical equipment So a patient can come in and actually blow into their device By detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients Currently they're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have So that was the six we had for you today but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world Prior to seeing this we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing I'm sure it's obvious to you now but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson over downstairs by the escalators and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that doesn't get wet He said that he was playing with it with his son And you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry A few weeks later he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said Look hydrophobic string I mean after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me Thank you very much Thank you This is a work in process based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine On this planet 1。6 billion people don't have access to electricity refrigeration or stored fuels This is a problem It impacts: the spread of disease and the quality of life propane gas kerosene or consumables Time for some thermodynamics And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator who talked about absorption and refrigeration it was cool but you didn't know what to do with it And it was invented in 1858 by this guy Ferdinand Carre This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley and it was a really neat idea but here's how it works and the other is a condenser The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side back on the erstwhile hot side it creates a powerful cooling effect So it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong It topped 400 psi The ammonia was toxic It sprayed everywhere But it was kind of an interesting thought So the great thing about 2006 is there's a lot of really great computational work you can do So we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures Brought in a team from the U。K -- there's a lot of great refrigeration people it turned out in the U。K -- and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure non-toxic refrigerator So this is the way it works You put it on a cooking fire Most people have cooking fires in the world whether it's camel dung or wood It heats up for about 30 minutes cools for an hour Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours It looks like this This is the fifth prototype It's not quite done Weighs about eight pounds and this is the way it works You put it into a 15-liter vessel about three gallons and it'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment It's really cheap We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars in low volumes for about 40 dollars And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have Thank you Cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet By the time you realize what's happening the child is a toddler up and causing havoc and it's too late to put it back We humans are Earth's Pandoran species We're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box and we can't push it back in We're seeing the consequences all around us Now that I suggest is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously And it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what's going on on our planet but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos So first of all I'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes and secondly how this might answer questions about who's out there if indeed anyone is So memetics: memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism Darwin had this amazing idea Indeed some people say it's the best idea anybody ever had Isn't that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had Do you think there could Audience: No Susan Blackmore: Someone says no very loudly from over there Well I say yes and if there is I give the prize to Darwin Why Because the idea was so simple and yet it explains all design in the universe I would say not just biological design but all of the design that we think of as human design It's all just the same thing happening What did Darwin say I know you know the idea natural selection but let me just paraphrase The Origin of Species 1859 in a few sentences What Darwin said was something like this: if you have creatures that vary and that can't be doubted -- I've been to the Galapagos and I've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on and so on And 100 pages later And if there is a struggle for life such that nearly all of these creatures die -- and this can't be doubted I've read Malthus and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted and so on and so on And another 100 pages later And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were You see the idea If if if then He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm but that's what he described in that book and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm The principle is you just need those three things -- variation selection and heredity And as Dan Dennett puts it if you have those then you must get evolution Or design out of chaos without the aid of mind There's one word I love on that slide What do you think my favorite word is Audience: Chaos SB: Chaos No What Mind No Audience: Without SB: No not without You try them all in order: Mmm。。。 Audience: Must SB: Must at must Must must This is what makes it so amazing You don't need a designer or a plan or foresight or anything else If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected then you must get design appearing out of nowhere You can't stop it Must is my favorite word there Now what's this to do with memes Well the principle here applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection We're so used to thinking in terms of biology we think about genes this way Darwin didn't of course; he didn't know about genes He talked mostly about animals and plants but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct But the principle of Universal Darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design And this is what Richard Dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller The Selfish Gene The information that is copied he called the replicator It selfishly copies Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going I want to get copied But that it will get copied if it can regardless of the consequences It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't because it's just information being copied And he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes and so he said Is there another replicator out there on the planet Ah yes there is Look around you -- here will do in this room All around us still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture is another replicator Information that we copy from person to person by imitation by language by talking by telling stories by wearing clothes by doing things This is information copied with variation and selection This is design process going on He wanted a name for the new replicator So he took the Greek word mimeme which means that which is imitated Remember that that's the core definition: that which is imitated And abbreviated it to meme just because it sounds good and made a good meme an effective spreading meme So that's how the idea came about It's important to stick with that definition The whole science of memetics is much maligned much misunderstood much feared But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition A meme is not equivalent to an idea It's not an idea It's not equivalent to anything else really Stick with the definition It's that which is imitated or information which is copied from person to person So let's see some memes Well you sir you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself or copied it from someone else If you copied it from someone else it's a meme And what about oh I can't see any interesting memes here All right everyone who's got some interesting memes for me Oh well your earrings I don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings You probably went out and bought them There are plenty more in the shops That's something that's passed on from person to person All the stories that we're telling -- well of course TED is a great meme-fest masses of memes The way to think about memes though is to think why do they spread They're selfish information they will get copied if they can or true or useful or beautiful Some of them will be copied even though they're not Some it's quite hard to tell why There's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy And I'm glad to say as I expected I found it when I came here and I'm sure all of you found it too You go to your nice posh international hotel somewhere and you come in and you put down your clothes and you go to the bathroom and what do you see Audience: Bathroom soap SB: Pardon Audience: Soap SB: Soap yeah What else do you see Audience: SB: Mmm mmm Audience: Sink toilet SB: Sink toilet yes these are all memes they're all memes but they're sort of useful ones and then there's this one What is this one doing This has spread all over the world It's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam Who folded that thing up there and why Some people get carried away Other people are just lazy and make mistakes Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker What is this all about I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's cleaned the place and it's all lovely And you know actually all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread germs from place to place So think of it this way Imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes The memes are all trying to get copied -- trying in inverted commas -- i。e。 that's the shorthand for if they can get copied they will They're using you and me as their propagating copying machinery and we are the meme machines Now why is this important Why is this useful or what does it tell us It gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human all conventional theories of cultural evolution of the origin of humans and what makes us so different from other species All other theories explaining the big brain and language and tool use and all these things that make us unique are based upon genes Language must have been useful for the genes Tool use must have enhanced our survival mating and so on It always comes back as Richard Dawkins complained all that long time ago it always comes back to genes The point of memetics is to say Oh no it doesn't There are two replicators now on this planet From the moment that our ancestors perhaps two and a half million years ago or so began imitating there was a new copying process Copying with variation and selection A new replicator was let loose and it could never be -- right from the start -- it could never be that human beings who let loose this new creature could just copy the useful beautiful true things and not copy the other things While their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy -- lighting fires keeping fires going new techniques of hunting these kinds of things -- inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair or wearing strange clothes or painting their faces or whatever So you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff and the memes themselves like the sounds that people made and copied -- in other words what turned out to be language -- competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger So the big brain on this theory is driven by the memes This is why in The Meme Machine I called it memetic drive As the memes evolve as they inevitably must they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that are doing the driving This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains that we like religion and music and art Language is a parasite that we've adapted to not something that was there originally for our genes on this view And like most parasites it can begin dangerous but then it coevolves and adapts and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite And so from our perspective we don't realize that that's how it began So this is a view of what humans are All other species on this planet are gene machines only they don't imitate at all well hardly at all We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well The memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine But that's not all We have a new kind of memes now I've been wondering for a long time since I've been thinking about memes a lot is there a difference between the memes that we copy -- the words we speak to each other the gestures we copy the human things -- and all these technological things around us I have always until now called them all memes but I do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes Let's call them techno-memes or temes Because the processes are getting different We began perhaps 5，000 years ago with writing We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet but in order to get true temes and true teme machines you need to get the variation the selection and the copying all done outside of humans And we're getting there We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there that there are machines like that And indeed in the short time I've already been at TED I see we're even closer than I thought we were before So actually now the temes are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read learning to use machinery We're going to have all kinds of implants drugs that force us to stay awake all the time We'll think we're choosing these things but the temes are making us do it So we're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet Now what about what else is going on out there in the universe Is there anyone else out there People have been asking this question for a long time We've been asking it here at TED already In 1961 Frank Drake made his famous equation but I think he concentrated on the wrong things It's been very productive that equation He wanted to estimate N the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy and he included in there the rate of star formation the rate of planets but crucially intelligence I think that's the wrong way to think about it Intelligence appears all over the place in all kinds of guises Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing But what's really important is the replicators you have and the levels of replicators one feeding on the one before So I would suggest that we don't think intelligence we think replicators And on that basis I've suggested a different kind of equation A very simple equation N the same thing the number of communicative civilizations out there that we might expect in our galaxy Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy The fraction of those which get a first replicator The fraction of those that get the second replicator The fraction of those that get the third replicator Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out -- sending information sending probes getting out there and communicating with anywhere else OK so if we take that equation why haven't we heard from anybody out there Because every step is dangerous Getting a new replicator is dangerous You can pull through we have pulled through but it's dangerous Take the first step as soon as life appeared on this earth We may take the Gaian view I loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday -- it's not Gaian all the time Actually life forms produce things that kill themselves Well we did pull through on this planet But then a long time later billions of years later we got the second replicator the memes That was dangerous all right Think of the big brain How many mothers do we have here You know all about big brains They are dangerous to give birth to are agonizing to give birth to My cat gave birth to four kittens purring all the time Ah mm -- slightly different But not only is it painful it kills lots of babies it kills lots of mothers and it's very expensive to produce The genes are forced into producing all this myelin all the fat to myelinate the brain Do you know sitting here your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight It's a really expensive organ to run Why Because it's producing the memes Now it could have killed us off It could have killed us off and maybe it nearly did but you see we don't know But maybe it nearly did Has it been tried before What about all those other species Louise Leakey talked yesterday about how we're the only one in this branch left What happened to the others Could it be that this experiment in imitation this experiment in a second replicator is dangerous enough to kill people off Well we did pull through and we adapted But now we're hitting as I've just described we're hitting the third replicator point And this is even more dangerous -- well it's dangerous again Why Because the temes are selfish replicators and they don't care about us or our planet or anything else They're just information why would they They are using us to suck up the planet's resources to produce more computers and more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED Don't think Oh we created the Internet for our own benefit That's how it seems to us Think temes spreading because they must We are the old machines Now are we going to pull through What's going to happen What does it mean to pull through Well there are kind of two ways of pulling through One that is obviously happening all around us now is that the temes turn us into teme machines with these implants with the drugs with us merging with the technology And why would they do that Because we are self-replicating We have babies We make new ones and so it's convenient to piggyback on us because we're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable Although it's closer I heard this morning it's closer than I thought it was Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves That way it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate was utterly destabilized and it was no longer possible for humans to live here Because those teme machines they wouldn't need -- they're not squishy wet oxygen-breathing warmth-requiring creatures They could carry on without us So those are the two possibilities The second I don't think we're that close It's coming but we're not there yet The first it's coming too But the damage that is already being done to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is that third danger point getting a third replicator And will we get through this third danger point like we got through the second and like we got through the first Maybe we will maybe we won't I have no idea That was an incredible talk SB: Thank you I scared myself As an architect you design for the present with an awareness of the past for a future which is essentially unknown The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day And I'd like to share some experience over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability How far you can anticipate what follows from it what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities I think that -- I've said in the past many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival But what I never said and what I'm really going to make the point is that really green is cool I mean all the projects which have in some way been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life I rarely actually quote anything so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can in which somebody at the end of last year ventured the thought about what for that individual as a kind of important observer analyst writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman who wrote in the Herald Tribune about 2006 He said I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street We reached a tipping point this year where living acting designing investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic capitalistic geo-political and competitive thing they could do Hence my motto: green is the new red white and blue And I asked myself in a way looking back When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear And I think it was July 20 1969 when for the first time man could look back at planet Earth And in a way it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase And before the kind of collapse of the communist system I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia And interestingly as I think back they were the first true environmentalists They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion fired about the problems of the Aral Sea And at that period it was -- in a way a number of things were happening Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again a word that had not been coined He was a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now It's another subject It's another conversation You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary It was at that time with an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies his concerns as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time And it's a number of projects I select this one because it was 1973 and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook and you had the hippie movement And there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up the recommendations And all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary you know 30-odd years later: wind energy recycling biomass solar cells And in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive design club People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun This is going back the mid-'50s '60s And despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort to amenities -- it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very very stylishly packaged And that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where as the virtual world which brings so many people together here finally connects with the physical world there is the reality that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously had gifted at lunchtime the unclear which is a further kind of development -- and again inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel A very very beautiful object So something which in the '50s '60s was very exclusive has now become interestingly quite inclusive And the reference to the iPod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance delivery -- quite interesting that in the beginning of the year 2007 the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid energy-conscious vehicle which rivals the iPod as an iconic product And I think it's very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves -- as architects or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings Buildings are important but they're only a component of a much bigger picture In other words as I might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a carbon-free house for example That would be the answer Unfortunately it's not the answer It's only the beginning of the problem You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit For example if in that Bucky-inspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet Earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings 44 percent transport 34 percent and industry But again that only shows part of the picture If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport in other words the transport of people which is 26 percent then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are a part For example if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city what I'll call simplistically a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent The city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more roads and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense is only using one-tenth of the energy In other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous So basically if you wanted to generalize you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there that the energy consumed reduces dramatically Of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance the quality of civic spaces But again you can see Detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below Copenhagen And Copenhagen although it's a dense city is not dense compared with the really dense cities In the year 2000 a rather interesting thing happened You had for the first time mega-cities of 5 million or more which were occurring in the developing world And now out of typically 46 cities 33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of for example China or India If you take China and you just take Beijing you can see on that traffic system and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles In other words if you put onto the roads as is currently happening 1，000 new cars every day -- statistically it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing And that urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace So if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities which took 200 years then that same process is happening in 20 years In other words it is accelerating by a factor of 10 And quite interestingly over something like a 60-year period we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization has trebled If I pull back from that global picture and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which as a tool is a tool for designers and I cite our own experience as a company and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology How does it affect the design of buildings And particularly how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially responsible That story in terms of buildings started in the late '60s early '70s The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber in a small market town in the northeast of England commuting distance with London And here the first thing you can see is that this building the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also about the celebration of public space In other words for this community they have this garden in the sky So the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight you have a connection with nature And nature is part of the generator the driver for this building And symbolically the colors of the interior are green and yellow It has facilities like swimming pools it has flextime it has a social heart a space you have contact with nature Now this was 1973 In 2001 this building received an award And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time And the people who'd created it came back: the project managers the company chairmen then And they were saying you know The architects Norman was always going on about designing for the future and you know it didn't seem to cost us any more So we humored him we kept him happy The image at the top what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail really what it is saying is you can wire this building This building was wired for change So in 1975 the image there is of typewriters And when the photograph was taken it's word processors And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology We were fortunate because in a way our building was future-proofed It anticipated change even though those changes were not known Round about that design period leading up to this building I did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently And I was saying and I wrote But we don't have the time and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level In other words we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads Notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building is very much a pioneering building And if I fast-forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory The library of the Free University which opened last year is an example of that And again the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality And a combination of devices here the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin which enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where it's really working with the forces of nature And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it Again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle and in a way the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit So it's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse I think it's a great -- it's a celebration And you can measure the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical library If I show another aspect of that technology then in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials but that material -- because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit to transfer that information now directly into the factory So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany and here you can see the guy with his computer screen and those points in space are communicated And on the left are the cutting machines which then in the factory enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site And then interestingly that building to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand-cut shingles One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish And again the way in which that works as a building for those of us who can enjoy the spaces to live and visit there If I made the leap into these new technologies then how did we -- what happened before that I mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone the things that you take for granted Well obviously the building still happened I mean this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979 which opened in 1985 with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here And in the absence of computers you have to physically model So for example we would put models under an artificial sky For wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air and the many kilometers of cable and so on And the turning point was probably in our terms when we had the first computer And that was at the time that we sought to redesign reinvent the airport This is Terminal Four at Heathrow typical of any terminal -- lots of machinery big pipes whirring machinery And Stansted the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place: you know where you are you can relate to the outside And for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light -- electric light which in turn creates more heat which creates more cooling loads and so on And at that particular point in time this was one of the few solitary computers And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted Not going back very far in time 1990 that's our office And if you looked very closely you'd see that people were drawing with pencils and they were pushing you know big rulers and triangles It's not that long ago 17 years and here we are now I mean major transformation and in 1987 she had all our information on one disk Now every week we have the equivalent of 84 million disks which record our archival information on past current and future projects That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky This is the view you would get if you looked down on that But meanwhile as you know wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature set in the context of that interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place Our Reichstag project which has a very familiar agenda I'm sure as a public place where we sought to in a way through a process of advocacy reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians public space And maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto -- something that would be free completely free of fuel as we know it So it would be totally renewable And again the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology But here not having to model it for real Obviously the wind tunnel had a place but the ability now with the computer to explore to plan to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature: natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at biomass A combination of biomass aquifers burning vegetable oil -- a process that quite interestingly was developed in Eastern Germany at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc So really retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean it was virtually pollution-free You can measure it again You can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project over 7，000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil 450 tons I mean a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way they spiral around But again very much about the lifestyle the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work And again we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption There is an evolution here between the projects and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London And this sequence shows the buildup of that model But what it shows first which I think is quite interesting is that here you see the circle you see the public space around it What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site If for example you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement it's the same amount of space And finally you profile this you cut grooves into it The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views which give light ventilation make the building fresher And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity And here if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria the way in which now with a computer we can model the forces we can see the high pressure the low pressure the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing So it also has the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to make the building fresh and efficient And unlike conventional buildings the top of the building is celebratory It's a viewing place for people not machinery And the base of the building is again about public space Comparing it with a typical building what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying The level is dropping rather like the Aral Sea And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline a pipe sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea And our translation of that using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years is to say what if that instead of being just a pipe what if it is a lifeline What if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the Grand Canal in terms of tourists habitation desalination agriculture In other words water is the lifeblood And if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it's absolutely central to society And how do we make more legible in this growing world especially in some of the places that I'm talking about -- China for example which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports Now what form do they take How do you make them more friendly at that scale Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment 250 -- excuse me 50，000 people working 24 hours seven days Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new un-built Terminal Five And the challenge here is a building that will be green that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel is about friendly is coming back to that starting point is very very much about the lifestyle And perhaps these in the end as celebratory spaces As Hubert was talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities Hubert was saying absolutely correctly These are the new cathedrals And in a way one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe you know the future was the most powerful innovative sort of nation The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say We put a man on the moon You know who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes and so on And that's a concerted platform It's more than one device you know it's renewable And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there -- the Chinas the Indias the Asian-Pacific tigers Thank you very much I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder: schizophrenia And as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of Dr Francine Benes in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry And in the lab we were asking the question What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day But then in the evenings and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for NAMI the National Alliance on Mental Illness But on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain And in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information On the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body If you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another And I have brought for you a real human brain So this is a real human brain This is the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head And when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another For those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus collosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers But other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate Because they process information differently each of our hemispheres think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities Excuse me Thank you It's been a joy Assistant: It has been Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment It's all about right here right now Our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family And right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place And in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details It then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities And our left hemisphere thinks in language It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world It's that little voice that says to me Hey you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home I need them in the morning It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry But perhaps most important it's that little voice that says to me I am I am And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke On the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye And it was the kind of pain -- caustic pain -- that you get when you bite into ice cream And it just gripped me -- and then it released me And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought OK I'll just start my normal routine So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider which is a full-body full-exercise machine And I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar And I thought That's very peculiar And I looked down at my body and I thought Whoa I'm a weird-looking thing And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience And it was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse So I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down And every step is very rigid and very deliberate There's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perceptions so I'm just focused on internal systems And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying OK You muscles you gotta contract You muscles you relax And then I lost my balance and I'm propped up against the wall And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall And all I could detect was this energy -- energy And I'm asking myself What is wrong with me What is going on And in that moment my brain chatter -- my left hemisphere brain chatter -- went totally silent Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button Total silence And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me Hey We got a problem We got a problem We gotta get some help And I'm going Ahh I got a problem I got a problem So it's like OK OK I got a problem But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land But it was beautiful there Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world So here I am in this space and my job -- and any stress related to my job -- it was gone And I felt lighter in my body And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone And I felt this sense of peacefulness And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage Oh I felt euphoria -- euphoria It was beautiful And then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says Hey You've got to pay attention We've got to get help And I'm thinking I got to get help I gotta focus So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I gotta get to work I gotta get to work Can I drive Can I drive And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side Then I realized Oh my gosh I'm having a stroke I'm having a stroke And the next thing my brain says to me is Wow This is so cool This is so cool How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out And then it crosses my mind But I'm a very busy woman I don't have time for a stroke So I'm like OK I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine OK So I gotta call help I gotta call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on it So I go into my business room I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity And in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card 。。 that's not the card 。。 that's not the card It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards In the meantime for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand the telephone but it's the only plan I have So I take the phone pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad But then I would drift back out into La La Land and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell Yes I've already dialed that number Eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me Woo woo woo woo And I think to myself Oh my gosh he sounds like a Golden Retriever And so I say to him -- clear in my mind I say to him: This is Jill I need help And what comes out of my voice is Woo woo woo woo woo I'm thinking Oh my gosh I sound like a Golden Retriever So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help And a little while later I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Massachusetts General Hospital And I curl up into a little fetal ball And just like a balloon with the last bit of air just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just -- I felt my spirit surrender And in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition When I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive When I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain Light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape Because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle And my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria Nirvana I found Nirvana And I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body But then I realized But I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found Nirvana And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana And I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives And it motivated me to recover Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my mama who is a true angel in my life It took me eight years to completely recover So who are we We are the life-force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds And we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world Right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form at one with all that is Or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid Separate from the flow separate from you I am Dr Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual neuroanatomist These are the we inside of me Which would you choose Which do you choose And when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be And I thought that was an idea worth spreading Images like this from the Auschwitz concentration camp have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are where we've come from and the times we live in During the twentieth century we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin Hitler Mao Pol Pot Rwanda and other genocides and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq This has led to a common understanding of our situation namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from to our peril Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago where the writer wrote The Indian life was a difficult one but there were no employment problems community harmony was strong substance abuse unknown crime nearly non-existent what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter Now you're all familiar with this treacle We teach it to our children We hear it on television and in storybooks Now the original title of this session was Everything You Know Is Wrong and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong that in fact our ancestors were far more violent than we are that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence Now in the decade of Darfur and Iraq a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon You can see it over millennia over centuries over decades and over years although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century One sees it all over the world although not homogeneously It's especially evident in the West beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 -- from the millennium scale to the year scale -- to try to persuade you of this Until 10，000 years ago all humans lived as hunter-gatherers without permanent settlements to be one of primordial harmony But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers which is our best source of evidence about this way of life has shown a rather different conclusion Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging or hunting and gathering societies The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man as opposed to passing away of natural causes in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to in the case of the Gebusi only a 15 percent chance The tiny little blue bar in the lower left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century and includes all the deaths of both World Wars If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million Also at the millennium scale we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible And in this supposed source of our moral values one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare such as the following from Numbers 31: And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses and they slew all the males And Moses said unto them 'Have you saved all the women alive Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves。' In other words kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk Also in the Bible one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality adultery blasphemy idolatry talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath Well let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude and look at the century scale Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times we know just from conventional history -- the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence For example any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine in those days would result in your tongue being cut out your ears being cut off you being blinded a hand being chopped off and so on There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment: burning at the stake disemboweling breaking on the wheel being pulled apart by horses and so on The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes: criticizing the king stealing a loaf of bread Slavery of course was the preferred labor-saving device and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat howling in pain was burned to death What about one-on-one murder Well there there are good statistics because many municipalities recorded the cause of death The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village hamlet town county that he could find and he supplemented them with national data when nations started keeping statistics He plotted on a logarithmic scale going from 100 deaths per 100，000 people per year which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100，000 people per year in seven or eight European countries Then there is a slight uptick in the 1960s The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century Let's click down now to the decade scale According to non-governmental organizations that keep such statistics since 1945 in Europe and the Americas there has been a steep decline in interstate wars in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms and in military coups even in South America Worldwide there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present And as you can see the death rate goes down from 65，000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2，000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade as horrific as it is Even in the year scale one can see a decline of violence Since the end of the Cold War there have been fewer civil wars fewer genocides -- indeed a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs -- and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s then it soared upward for several decades and began a precipitous decline starting in the 1990s so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960 President Clinton if you're here thank you So the question is why are so many people so wrong about something so important I think there are a number of reasons is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth-century monks were There's a cognitive illusion We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something the higher the probability that you assign to it Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture And of course our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time That's a process that seems to be continuing but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards So today we get exercised -- and rightly so -- if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a 15-year appeal process We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted 10 minutes and indeed that that would have been repeated over and over again Today we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink rather than how high our standards have risen Well why has violence declined No one really knows but I have read four explanations all of which I think have some grain of plausibility The first is maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary poor nasty brutish and short Not because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative but because of the logic of anarchy In a state of anarchy there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively before they invade you More recently Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement Being a good American he has a pistol in the nightstand pulls out his gun and walks down the stairs And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand Now each one of them is thinking I don't really want to kill that guy but he's about to kill me Maybe I had better shoot him before he shoots me especially since even if he doesn't want to kill me he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me And so on Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first Now one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence You don't strike first but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded The only thing is that it's liable to having its bluff called and therefore can only work if it's credible To make it credible you must avenge all insults and settle all scores which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta Life becomes an episode of The Sopranos Hobbes' solution the Leviathan was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack because any kind of aggression will be punished leaving its profitability as zero That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively out of fear of them attacking you first It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible And therefore it would lead to a state of peace Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy in failed states collapsed empires frontier regions mafias street gangs and so on The second explanation is that in many times and places there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap In earlier times when suffering and early death were common in one's own life one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant one puts a higher value on life in general This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game and was worked out in the book Nonzero by the journalist Robert Wright Wright points out that in certain circumstances in an interaction such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in by allowing the trade of goods services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead and violence declines for selfish reasons As Wright put it Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini-van The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called The Expanding Circle by the philosopher Peter Singer who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own Unfortunately by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family People outside that circle are treated as sub-human and can be exploited with impunity But over history the circle has expanded One can see in historical record it expanding from the village to the clan to the tribe to the nation to other races to both sexes and in Singer's own arguments something that we should extend to other sentient species The question is if this has happened what has powered that expansion And there are a number of possibilities such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact with other people the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs at least not if you want them to listen to you You can't say that my interests are special compared to yours anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism by histories and journalism and memoirs and realistic fiction and travel and literacy which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life the sense that there but for fortune go I Whatever its causes the decline of violence I think has profound implications It should force us to ask not just why is there war But also why is there peace Not just what are we doing wrong But also what have we been doing right Because we have been doing something right and it sure would be good to find out what it is Thank you very much I loved that talk I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about that Peter Singer talks about is also driven by just by technology by greater visibility of the other and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller I mean is that also a grain of truth Steven Pinker: Very much It would fit both in Wright's theory that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles But also I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages you think how could they possibly have done it how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling But clearly as far as they're concerned this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own Anything I think that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person Well Steve I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year I think it's really important Thank you so much SP: My pleasure So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have and that's that I'm a philosopher When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say I'm a professor their eyes glaze over When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around they ask me what field I'm in and I say philosophy -- their eyes glaze over When I go to a philosopher's party and they ask me what I work on and I say consciousness their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think That's impossible You can't explain consciousness The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question My late lamented friend Bob Nozick a fine philosopher in one of his books Philosophical Explanations is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business And he says you know Philosophers love rational argument And he says It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion and if they don't accept the conclusion they die Their heads explode The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness and I finally figured out the reason for that The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games They all have an idea for a video game even if they're not experts But they don't consider themselves experts on video games; they've just got strong opinions I'm sure that people here who work on say climate change and global warming or on the future of the Internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise They're just strongly held opinions But with regard to consciousness people seem to think each of us seems to think I am an expert Simply by being conscious I know all about this And so you tell them your theory and they say No no that's not the way consciousness is No you've got it all wrong And they say this with an amazing confidence And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence Because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are yourselves authoritative about your own consciousness That's the order of the day here Now this nice picture shows a thought-balloon a thought-bubble I think everybody understands what that means That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque Suzanne R -- he's off to the races There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along you learn a lot about this man What I particularly like about this picture too is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style Which reminds us as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday: what we are what each of us is -- what you are what I am -- is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots That's what we're made of No other ingredients at all We're just made of cells about 100 trillion of them Not a single one of those cells is conscious; not a single one of those cells knows who you are or cares Somehow we have to explain how when you put together teams armies battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium each one of them -- the result is this I mean just look at it The content -- there's color there's ideas there's memories there's history And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons How is that possible Many people just think it isn't possible at all They think No there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel who's a professor of religion actually at the University of Hawaii and he's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of India which is what this book is about Net of Magic And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you It speaks so eloquently to the problem 'I'm writing a book on magic，' I explain and I'm asked 'Real magic？' By 'real magic，' people mean miracles thaumaturgical acts and supernatural powers 'No，' I answer 'Conjuring tricks not real magic。' 'Real magic，' in other words refers to the magic that is not real; while the magic that is real that can actually be done is not real magic Now that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks then it's not real consciousness whatever it is And as Marvin said and as other people have said Consciousness is a bag of tricks This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness So this is the problem So I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you How many of you here if somebody -- some smart aleck -- starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done you sort of want to block your ears and say No no I don't want to know Don't take the thrill of it away I'd rather be mystified Don't tell me the answer A lot of people feel that way about consciousness I've discovered And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity some understanding on you You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks But I'm not going to explain it all to you I'm going to do what philosophers do Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick The philosopher says I'm going to explain to you how that's done You see the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half He merely makes you think that he does And you say Yes and how does he do that He says Oh that's not my department I'm sorry So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is This is something by the way that Lee Siegel talks about in his book He marvels at how he'll do a magic show and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X Y and Z He never did those things He didn't even try to do those things People's memories inflate what they think they saw And the same is true of consciousness Now let's see if this will work All right Let's just watch this Watch it carefully I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer and this is a little demo that he's done for me part of a larger project some of you may be interested in We're looking for a backer It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness OK now you all saw what changed right How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color Every one I'll just show you by running it again Even when you know that they're all going to change color it's very hard to notice You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all Now this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book Consciousness Explained where I said if you did experiments of this sort you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes If there's time at the end I'll show you the much more dramatic case Now how can it be that there are all those changes going on and that we're not aware of them Well earlier today Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades the way your eye moves around three or four times a second He didn't mention the speed Your eye is constantly in motion looking at interesting things in the world And where your eye isn't looking you're remarkably impoverished in your vision That's because the foveal part of your eye which is the high-resolution part is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length That's the detail part It doesn't seem that way does it It doesn't seem that way but that's the way it is You're getting in a lot less information than you think Here's a completely different effect This is a painting by Bellotto It's in the museum in North Carolina Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's And I love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here And I love Canalettos because Canaletto has this fantastic detail and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting And I started across the hall in North Carolina because I thought it was probably a Canaletto and would have all that in detail And I noticed that on the bridge there there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people see their clothes and so forth And as I got closer and closer I actually screamed I yelled out because when I got closer I found the detail wasn't there at all There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint And as I walked towards the picture I was expecting detail that wasn't there The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things and my brain had taken the suggestion You're familiar with a more recent technology which is -- There you can get a better view of the blobs See when you get close they're really just blobs of paint You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect I'll just give that to you one more time Now what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion When an artful blob of paint or two by an artist suggests a person -- say one of Marvin Minsky's little society of mind -- I don't think so Not a chance But then how on Earth is it done Well remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady It's the same thing The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there You think the detail's there but it isn't there The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all It's just making you expect the detail Let's just do this experiment very quickly Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right rotated Yes How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye to see if it matched up with the one on the right How many of you rotated the one on the right OK How do you know that's what you did There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images Yes it's possible to do that But the details of the process are still in significant controversy And if you read that literature one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment you don't know You don't know how you do it You just know that you have certain beliefs And they come in a certain order at a certain time And what explains the fact that that's what you think Well that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician You may think that I've cheated that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there How many of you see that sort of boundary with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles Can you see it Well you know in effect the boundary's really there in a certain sense Your brain is actually computing that boundary the boundary that goes right there But now notice there are two ways of seeing the cube right It's a Necker cube Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube OK Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube Because there's another way of seeing it If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles some black circles there's another way of seeing it As a cube on a black background as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese Can you get it How many of you can't get it That'll help Now you can get it These are two very different phenomena When you see the cube one way behind the screen those boundaries go away But there's still a sort of filling in as we can tell if we look at this We don't have any trouble seeing the cube but where does the color change Does your brain have to send little painters in there The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain No Your brain just lets it go The brain doesn't need to fill that in When I first started talking about the Bradley Petrie Dumais example that you just saw -- I'll go back to it this one -- I said that there was no filling-in behind there And I supposed that that was just a flat truth always true But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't Now if you think you see some pale yellow -- I'll run this a few more times Look in the gray areas and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah it's amazing There's nothing there It's no trick This is Ron Rensink's work which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book Let me just pause this for a second if I can This is change-blindness What you're going to see is two pictures one of which is slightly different from the other You see here the red roof and the gray roof and in between them there will be a mask which is just a blank screen for about a quarter of a second So you'll see the first picture then a mask then the second picture then a mask And this will just continue and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change So show the original picture for 240 milliseconds Blank Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds Blank And keep going until the subject presses the button saying I see the change So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment We're going to start easy Some examples No trouble there Can everybody see All right Indeed Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button Can you see that one 2。9 seconds How many don't see it still What's on the roof of that barn It's easy Is it a bridge or a dock There are a few more really dramatic ones and then I'll close I want you to see a few that are particularly striking This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see Can you see it Audience: Yes Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth Pretty big So 15。5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there I love this one I'll end with this one just because it's such an obvious and important thing How many still don't see it How many still don't see it How many engines on the wing of that Boeing Right in the middle of the picture Thanks very much for your attention What I wanted to show you is that scientists using their from-the-outside third-person methods can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of and that in fact you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind Jeff Hawkins this morning was describing his attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience And he's right This is a problem Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said In our lab we have a saying If you work on one neuron that's neuroscience If you work on two neurons that's psychology We have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down Thank you very much When you have 21 minutes to speak two million years seems like a really long time But evolutionarily two million years is nothing And yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here Habilis to the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one Well it turns out when brains triple in size they don't just get three times bigger; they gain new structures And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe And particularly a part called the pre-frontal cortex Now what does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time Well it turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things it does is it is an experience simulator Flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don't make real mistakes in planes Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can It's a marvelous adaptation It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall Now -- -- all of you have done this I mean you know and it's not because they whipped some up tried it and went Yuck It's because without leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make it Let's see how your experience simulators are working Let's just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate and you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer One of them is winning the lottery This is about 314 million dollars And the other is becoming paraplegic So just give it a moment of thought You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought Interestingly there are data on these two groups of people data on how happy they are And this is exactly what you expected isn't it But these aren't the data I made these up These are the data You failed the pop quiz and you're hardly five minutes into the lecture Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives Now don't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time The research that my laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing have revealed something really quite startling to us something we call the impact bias which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are From field studies to laboratory studies we see that winning or losing an election gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion passing or not passing a college test on and on have far less impact less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have In fact a recent study -- this almost floors me -- a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago with only a few exceptions it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness Why Because happiness can be synthesized Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642 I am the happiest man alive I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head Well it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have Human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system A system of cognitive processes largely non-conscious cognitive processes that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves Like Sir Thomas you have this machine Unlike Sir Thomas you seem not to know it We synthesize happiness but we think happiness is a thing to be found Now you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness I suspect Though I'm going to show you some experimental evidence you don't have to look very far for evidence As a challenge to myself since I say this once in a while in lectures I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness And here are three guys synthesizing happiness I am so much better off physically financially emotionally mentally and almost every other way I don't have one minute's regret It was a glorious experience I believe it turned out for the best Who are these characters who are so damn happy Well the first one is Jim Wright Some of you are old enough to remember: he was the chairman of the House of Representatives found out about a shady book deal he had done He lost everything The most powerful Democrat in the country he lost everything He lost his money; he lost his power What does he have to say all these years later about it I am so much better off physically financially mentally and in almost every other way What other way would there be to be better off Vegetably Minerally Animally He's pretty much covered them there Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released He was 78 years old He spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence And what did he have to say about his experience I don't have one minute's regret It was a glorious experience Glorious This guy is not saying Well you know there were some nice guys They had a gym It's glorious a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience Harry S Langerman uttered these words and he's somebody you might have known but didn't because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonalds And he thought That's a really neat idea So he went to find them They said We can give you a franchise on this for 3，000 bucks Harry went back to New York asked his brother who's an investment banker to loan him the 3，000 dollars You idiot nobody eats hamburgers He wouldn't lend him the money and of course six months later Ray Croc had exactly the same idea It turns out people do eat hamburgers and Ray Croc for a while became the richest man in America And then finally -- you know the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best who was the original drummer for the Beatles until they you know sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour -- yes he's still a drummer; yes he's a studio musician -- he had this to say: I'm happier than I would have been with the Beatles Okay There's something important to be learned from these people and it is the secret of happiness Here it is finally to be revealed First: accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it Second: spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can Third: make somebody else really really rich And finally: never ever join the Beatles OK Now I like Ze Frank can predict your next thought which is Yeah right Because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done we all smile at them but we kind of roll our eyes and say Yeah right you never really wanted the job Oh yeah right You really didn't have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness What are these terms Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don't get what we wanted And in our society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind Why do we have that belief Well it's very simple What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard is not going to be particularly profitable because they don't want stuff enough I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for Now I'm a scientist so I'm going to do this not with rhetoric but by marinating you in a little bit of data Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks And this isn't mine This is a 50-year-old paradigm called the free choice paradigm It's very simple You bring in say six objects and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked In this case because the experiment I'm going to tell you about uses them these are Monet prints So everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most to the one they like the least Now we give you a choice: We happen to have some extra prints in the closet We're going to give you one as your prize to take home We happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject This is a bit of a difficult choice because neither one is preferred strongly to the other but naturally people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four Sometime later -- it could be 15 minutes; it could be 15 days -- the same stimuli are put before the subject and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli Tell us how much you like them now What happens Watch as happiness is synthesized This is the result that has been replicated over and over again You're watching happiness be synthesized Would you like to see it again Happiness The one I got is really better than I thought That other one I didn't get sucks That's the synthesis of happiness Now what's the right response to that Yeah right Now here's the experiment we did and I would hope this is going to convince you that Yeah right was not the right response We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia These are hospitalized patients Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome and they can't make new memories OK They remember their childhood but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they don't know who you are We took our Monet prints to the hospital And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least We then gave them the choice between number three and number four Like everybody else they said Gee thanks Doc That's great I could use a new print I'll take number three We explained we would have number three mailed to them We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour Back into the room we say Hi we're back The patients bless them say Ah Doc I'm sorry I've got a memory problem; that's why I'm here If I've met you before I don't remember Really Jim you don't remember I was just here with the Monet prints Sorry Doc I just don't have a clue No problem Jim All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least What do they do Well let's first check and make sure they're really amnesiac We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own which one they chose last time which one is theirs And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess These are normal controls where if I did this with you all of you would know which print you chose But if I do this with amnesiac patients they don't have a clue They can't pick their print out of a lineup Here's what normal controls do: they synthesize happiness Right This is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you; now I'm showing it to you in graphical form -- The one I own is better than I thought The one I didn't own the one I left behind is not as good as I thought Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing Think about this result These people like better the one they own but they don't know they own it Yeah right is not the right response What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really truly changed their affective hedonic aesthetic reactions to that poster They're not just saying it because they own it because they don't know they own it Now when psychologists show you bars you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people And yet all of us have this psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness but some of us do this trick better than others And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do It turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy But freedom to choose -- to change and make up your mind -- is the enemy of synthetic happiness And I'm going to show you why Dilbert already knows of course You're reading the cartoon as I'm talking Dogbert's tech support How may I abuse you My printer prints a blank page after every document Why would you complain about getting free paper Free Aren't you just giving me my own paper Egad man Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same Ah Now that you mention it it does seem a little silkier What are you doing I'm helping people accept the things they cannot change Indeed The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck when we are trapped This is the difference between dating and marriage right I mean you go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose; you don't go out on another date You're married to a guy and he picks his nose Yeah he has a heart of gold; don't touch the fruitcake Right You find a way to be happy with what's happened Now what I want to show you is that people don't know this about themselves and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage Here's an experiment we did at Harvard We created a photography course a black-and-white photography course and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom So we gave them cameras; they went around campus; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of They bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet; they figure out which are the two best pictures; and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms And they blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of meaningful things to them and we say Which one would you like to give up They say I have to give one up Oh yes We need one as evidence of the class project So you have to give me one You have to make a choice You get to keep one and I get to keep one Now there are two conditions in this experiment In one case the students are told But you know if you want to change your mind I'll always have the other one here and in the next four days before I actually mail it to headquarters I'll be glad to -- -- yeah headquarters -- I'll be glad to swap it out with you In fact I'll come to your dorm room and give -- just give me an email Better yet I'll check with you You ever want to change your mind it's totally returnable The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite: Make your choice And by the way the mail is going out gosh in two minutes to England Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic You will never see it again Now half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they're going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction with the pictures And look at what we find First of all here's what students think is going to happen They think they're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind but these are not statistically significant differences It's a very small increase and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition Wrong-o Bad simulators Because here's what's really happening Both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind like it a lot And people who are deliberating -- Should I return it Have I gotten the right one Maybe this isn't the good one Maybe I left the good one -- have killed themselves They don't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still don't like their picture Why Because the reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness So here's the final piece of this experiment We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say You know we're doing a photography course and we can do it one of two ways We could do it so that when you take the two pictures you'd have four days to change your mind or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it Which course would you like to be in Duh 66 percent of the students two-thirds prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind Hello 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows The Bard said everything best of course and he's making my point here but he's making it hyperbolically: 'Tis nothing good or bad But thinking makes it so It's nice poetry but that can't exactly be right Is there really nothing good or bad Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing That seems like a one-question IQ test They can't be exactly the same In more turgid prose but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism Adam Smith and he said this This is worth contemplating: The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another 。。 Some of these situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred to others but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice In other words: yes some things are better than others We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are at risk When our ambition is bounded it leads us to work joyfully When our ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie to cheat to steal to hurt others to sacrifice things of real value When our fears are bounded we're prudent; we're cautious; we're thoughtful When our fears are unbounded and overblown we're reckless and we're cowardly The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience Thank you I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly To explain the wish I'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been and that's around the world When I was about 24 years old Kate Store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work Not only about responding to natural disasters but involved in systemic issues We believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives and I was always interested in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact But when I went to architectural school it seemed that I was the black sheep in the family Many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it's a jewel that you try and crave for Whereas I felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it but for the community as a whole And in 1999 we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo and I didn't know what I was doing; like I say mid-20s and I'm the I'm the Internet generation so we started a website We put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic That led to 550 entries from 53 countries We also have designers from around the world that participate And we had an exhibit of work that followed that 2004 was the tipping point for us We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran and Bam also following up on our work in Africa Working within the United States most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but go live -- I live in Bozeman Montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to Alabama or Mississippi pre-Katrina and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries I've been to So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere And then also I will go into some more projects 2005 Mother Nature kicked our arse I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters And because of the Internet and because of connections to blogs and so forth within literally hours of the tsunami we were already raising funds getting involved working with people on the ground We run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days I had 4，000 emails from people needing help So we began to get involved in projects there and I'll talk about some others And then of course this year we've been responding to Katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction works So this is a brief overview In 2004 I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that I was getting It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone So we decided to embrace an open source model of business -- that anyone anywhere in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia All problems are local All solutions are local So and that means you know somebody who is based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do So what happened is we used MeetUp and all these other kind of Internet tools and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up thousands of architects in 104 countries So the bullet point -- sorry I never do a suit so I knew that I was going to take this off OK because I'm going to do it very quick So in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change I'm adding that to my time So what you don't know is we've got these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three By doing something the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it we did it And so there's something to be said about naivete So seven years later we've developed so that we've got advocacy instigation and implementation We advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy We can talk about FEMA but that's another talk Instigation developing ideas with communities and NGOs doing open-source design competitions Referring matchmaking with communities and then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work because when you invent it's never a reality until it's built So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change we build that change So here's a select number of projects Kosovo This is Kosovo in '99 We did an open design competition like I said It led to a whole variety of ideas and this wasn't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in and that they would rebuild their own home This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community; this was giving them the tools and and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to We have from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked This is an inflatable hemp house It was built; it works This is a shipping container Built and works And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks So we've engaged not just designers but also you know a whole variety of technology-based professionals Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes Using straw bale construction creating heat walls And then something remarkable happened in '99 We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue Within three days we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10 15 kilometers to see doctors you get the doctors to the people And we started engaging the medical community And I thought you know we thought we were real bright you know sparks -- we've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa And the community the medical community there said We've said this for the last decade We know this We just don't know how to show this So in a way we had taken a pre-existing need and shown solutions And so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in This one I personally love because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness This is a kenaf clinic You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and then once -- and it grows 14 feet in a month And on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers you cut down the clinic and you eat it It's an Eat Your Own Clinic So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti-retrovirals out there So you know this is a serious solution This one I love The idea is it's not just a clinic -- it's a community center This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self-sustaining project Every one of these projects is sustainable That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person It's because when you live on four dollars a day you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable You have to know where your energy is coming from You have to know where your resource is coming from And you have to keep the maintenance down So this is about getting an economic engine and then at night it turns into a movie theater So it's not an AIDS clinic It's a community center So you can see ideas And these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built And currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya From that we also developed Siyathemba which was a project -- the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don't have education And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate And that's not because they're promiscuous it's because there's no knowledge And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors So that there would be a very slow way of developing kind of confidence in health care And we picked nine finalists and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community picked their design They said this is our design because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process So the winning design is here and then of course we actually go and work with the community and the clients So this is the designer He's out there working and they can tell it better Well my name is Sisi because I work at the African center I'm a consultant and I'm also the national football player for South Africa Bafana Bafana and I also play in the Vodacom League for the team called Tembisa which has now changed to Siyathemba This is our home ground Cameron Sinclair: So I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time I can see Chris looking at me slyly This was a connection just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center in Tanzania And we met literally a couple of months ago We've already developed a design and the team is over there working in partnership This was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of TEDsters: unclear Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli who connected me with this amazing African woman And we start construction in June and it will be opened by TEDGlobal So when you come to TEDGlobal you can check it out But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development and we've been involved in a lot of issues such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled This is a community-designed community center And what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they're part of the design process The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be and then eventually the community is actually through skills training end up building the building with us Here is another school This is what the U。N gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps This was in August This was the replacement and it's supposed to last for two years When the rain comes down you can't hear a thing So we said if the rain's coming down let's get fresh water So every one of our schools have rain water collection systems very low cost A class three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5，000 dollars This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta It's built by the parents of the kids The kids are out there on-site building the buildings And it opened a couple of weeks ago and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools So disaster hits home We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that but we don't see the good stories Here is a community that got together and they said no to waiting They formed a partnership a diverse partnership of players to actually map out East Biloxi to figure out who is getting involved We've had over 1，500 volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes Figuring out what FEMA regulations are not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild Working with residents getting them out of their homes so they don't get ill This is what they're cleaning up on their own Designing housing This house is going to go in in a couple of weeks This is a rehabbed home done in four days This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker She's 70 years old This is what FEMA gave her 600 bucks happened two days ago We put together very quickly a washroom It's built; it's running and she just started a business today where she's washing other peoples clothes This is Shandra and the Calhouns They're photographers who have documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years That was their home and these are the photographs they took And we're helping working with them to create a new building Projects we've done Projects we've been a part of support Why don't aid agencies do this This is the U。N tent This is the new U。N tent just introduced this year Quick to assemble It's got a flap that's the invention It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field I was 12 years old There's a problem here Luckily we're not alone There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work More hemp houses -- it's a theme in Japan apparently I'm not sure what they're smoking This is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams This guy designed for NASA is now doing housing I'm going to whip through this quickly because I know I've got only a couple of minutes So this is all done in the last two years I showed you something that took 20 years to do And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years From Brazil to India Mexico Vietnam who gets involved in this project is 32 -- that's how old I am So it's a young -- I just have to stop here because Arup is in the room and this is the best-designed toilet in the world If you're ever ever in India go use this toilet Chris Luebkeman will tell you why I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York but this And when you look at this you see crisis What I see is many many inventors One billion people live in abject poverty We hear about them all the time Four billion live in growing but fragile economies One in seven live in unplanned settlements If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in 20 years one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp Look left look right: one of you will be there How do we improve the living standards of five billion people With 10 million solutions So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone Wait a second Wait a second That's your wish CS: That's my wish That's his wish CS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website So Chris somehow decided to give me 100，000 So why not this many people Open-source architecture is the way to go You have a diverse community of participants -- and we're not just talking about inventors and designers but we're talking about the funding model My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world And what we need is something that replicates me globally because I haven't slept in seven years Secondly what will this thing be Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it So Creative Commons has developed the developing nations license And what that means is that a designer can -- the Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it As soon as that is built anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protecting their rights here We want to have a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere environments The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works That's too late We need to do it now So doing that globally And I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually When you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray-haired white guy I don't see that I see the face of the world So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development The idea of needs-based competitions -- X-Prize for the other 98 percent if you want to call it that We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together And the idea of integrating manufacturers -- fab labs in every country When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child -- educate every designer in the world Put one in every favela every slum settlement because you know what innovation will happen And I need to know that It's called the leap-back We talk about leapfrog technologies I write with Worldchanging and the one thing we've been talking about is I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here So let's take those ideas adapt them and we can use them These ideas are supposed to have adaptable; they should have the potential for evolution; they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world What will it take There should be a sheet I don't have time to read this because I'm going to be yanked off Just leave it up there for a sec CS: Well what will it take You guys are smart So it's going to take a lot of computing power because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs but utilize the designs Also a process of reviewing the designs I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing because those guys are the best in the world Plug And so you know I want these -- and I just should note I have two laptops and one of them there is there and that has 3000 designs on it If I drop that laptop what happens So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there easy to use easy to get a hold of My mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers I'm fed up of talking about making change You only make it by doing it We've changed FEMA guidelines We've changed public policy We've changed international response -- based on building things So for me it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation and that it's free innovation Think of free culture -- this is free innovation Somebody said this a couple of years back I will give points for those who know it I think the man was maybe 25 years too early so let's do it
